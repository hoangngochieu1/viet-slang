Oh, you a stunt man!!
I got the job on the Internet.
Well, nearly. I'm waiting for confirmation.
Oh, how exciting!
The coolest stunt man n the world
- on a moped, right?
On a Harley-Davidson, actually.
Films! Those stars! That money!
Oh! Oh!
Have you seen Carina's dress in the magazine?
I'd love to have a dress like that.
Mmm, me too.
It would really suit me.
How much is it? Oh, let's see.
How much?!
Oh, I'm a student, it's too expensive for me!
I've got a job and it's too expensive for me!
We need more money.
Money?
Bridget, Annie, I have something to tell you.
Hector, don't! It's a secret!
The Romero family, one of the richest families in Argentina.
Keep it a secret. Sssh.
Uh? Sssh!
What's a secret?
You have been very kind.
Yes, Hector.
Ha-ha, ha-ha! I'm sure Bridget and Annie have a little money! Ha-ha!
Sssh! Nick!!
So I want to,
I want to give you some money.
Yes!
So, I am going ...
... to look for a job.
Oh … that's a great idea, Hector.
Gr-eat!!
Yeah, we can look for a job on the Internet, can't we.
OK, here we are, job vacancies.
Well, let's see.
Oh well, there's a job in a launderette.
Hector! No!.
And there's a job as a gardener.
My plant!
No!
And here's a job as a cook.
No.
Wait a minute! Look at this!
A waiter!
What a great idea!
Yes! Ooh, I love good looking waiters!
Did you say 'good looking'? Here I am!
What about Hector as a waiter?
A waiter?
Yeah, you know
Oh, but I don't know how.
Oh, don't worry. I will teach you!
Hello!
Howard!
How are you?!!
Oh, thank you Howard!
Me? Dinner tonight!
Seven o'clock - at the Singing Parrot Café,
OK Howard! Bye Howard!
That was Howard. No!
He's invited me to dinner tonight,
because he wants to...That was Howard. ...talk to me about a NEW JOB!
Who is Howard?
Bridget's boss. Ah,
he is so rich,
he's so clever and he wants to see me!!
He might offer me a promotion!
What shall I wear?
I have nothing to wear!
No, wrong!
Huh! So last season.
Bet Howard can't ride a motorbike.
Nope!
I hope he does give Bridget promotion,
although I have heard Howard has a nickname!
What was I thinking?
What?
The octopus!
The octopus?!
Oh, the octo-pus!
Is he meeting her alone?
Yes.
No, no!
Bridget needs help! We must stop her!
I have an idea.
Why don't you eat here?
No!
Yes, then we can both talk to your boss about your new job!
Where, here?
No, no way.
I could cook for you!
Huh! Definitely not, no!
And I could be your waiter!
M-mm.
I want to be your waiter.
Yeah, OK then, but be serious!
But don't worry, we will help you get your promotion
Leave it to us!
OK, Hector, you are the waiter, so you must set the table.
Yes, I have set the table, but there is one problem.
A problem?
The table is too small.
The table is too small?
Yes, look.
Hector, this is set for twelve courses!
Dinner at home is always like this.
Oh, yes! You are a million…
You are a millionaire.
This is just a little dinner for Bridget's boss
OK? OK.
OK! I am a customer!
Where would you like to sit?
Hmm.
Here.
Oh, I … … …
The bill.
Not yet! The menu first!
Oh, sorry, erm … The menu.
Forget the menu. What have you got today?
To eat? To eat.
Today, as dish of the day,
I have a delicious hot cat.
A hot cat?!
That's a hot dog.
Ah! Hot cat, hot dog!
… Cat, hot …
Oh no!
Oh, how's it going?
Great! Nick is a good teacher.
Let's see. Ah-ah, Hector's café is now closed.
Oh!!!
I'll get it.
Delivery, Miss Evans and Miss Taylor.
Oh, Thank you!
Bridget, look!
'For lovely Annie from H.'
For beautiful Bridget from H.
Who's H? Oh, it must be Howard!
What is it?!
Oh, Bridget!
Look, it's Carina's dress!
But how did he guess?!
Oh, he's a clever man!
Anyway, it's not Carina's dress now, it's Bridget's dress!
Oh, thank you Howard!
Oh Bridget, isn't your boss kind!
But, why did he buy me one?
Oh, I've told him all about you!
Woooow!!!
OK, Nick?!
Yeah. Hot. The soup, hot.
The soup is hot.
Thank you Hector.
He's here.
Good evening Howard. Ah Bridget, my princess!
Please come in.
Bridget, you look divine
Oh, this must be An-nie.
Are you sisters?
Such beauty!
The dresses are exquisite
Oh … Thank you!!!
Don't thank me, it's a privilege!
Oh and this of course is Nick.
Hi.
And this is Hector. He's from Argentina.
Hello. Argentina.
Do you have a cow?
Two million!
What?
My parents own two million cows.
Ah yes, thank you Hector.
Hector's English is a little … Weird!
Never mind, 'Ector.
So Bridget what a beautiful apartment, for a beautiful lady.
Dinner is served!
Hector, go on!
Today, we have sick pea soup.
Mmm, sick pea soup, my favourite!
Chick pea, chick pea!
[Erm] Chick pea soup.
This guy is great!
Where did you find him?!
Sick pea soup!
Mind you, it does look like - ugh!
Sorry Nick!
Main course. Teeth casserole.
Teeth casserole?
Beef, beef.
Oh sorry, beef casserole!
I bet the beef is as hard as teeth!
A dinner with bite!
Oh! Sorry, Nick!
So Bridget, you would like a better job?
Well Howard, I woul... I …
Are you willing to work harder, hah?
You stupid idiot!
Sorry, erm … !
And Bridget, with your good looks …
What a creep!
Ay! It's cold!
'Ector! I want hot coffee!
He wants hot coffee.
Then he will have... ...hot coffee!
by the age of twenty
I had fifty people working for me.
Fascinating!
My father said,
if you want more money, you must work hard!
Ay! You have poisoned me!
You fool, you stupid boy!
Stupid!
Don't you dare talk to my friend Hector like that!
Oh, what is he? Is he your boyfriend or something?!
He is...
A kind and clever and lovely man,
which is something that you will never, ever be!
So you can keep your job, you creep!
And we'll send you back the dresses!
What dresses?
Oh, these dresses, the ones you bought Annie and me!
I did not buy those dresses.
I would not spend money on you!
Goodbye Howard
You've lost your job!
Well too late, I quit!!!
Howard said he did not buy the dresses.
So who did?
If 'H' isn't for Howard?
Then 'H' is for Hector!
You, but why did you buy the dresses?
To say thank you.
But they're so expensive! Where did you get the money?
I ... found it.
Well, these expensive dresses must go back to the shop.
Yes they must!
But not until tomorrow.
That's right, let's go clubbing!
Come on, Nick! Hector!
See you later, boys!
Hector, you are a true, true friend.
Money is not everything.
what did you buy me?
What do you think?
I love you, I love you!
Hmm! One moment.
You didn't buy me a bike,
You didn't buy me a bike,
You didn't buy me a bike!
OK.
Thanks, Hector.
It's really, really …
It's OK Nick.
Hop on, I'll give you a lift.
Hey …
So do you still want to be a waiter?
No, I want to be like you, Nick, a stunt man!
Aaah!!!
Next time in EXTRA!
Nick gets a job on TV.
Annie loves watching TV.
And why does Hector want to learn to cook?
This is the story of Bridget and Annie, who share a flat in London
and the boys next door, Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina
The girls like Hector because he is...pure
And Nick likes Hector because he is rich
And Hector likes Nick because he is one crazy guy.
(voices on television) But, I can't live without you.
I love you.
I love you too, but it's for the best. It's finished.
Oh, but darling, no. I'll die without you.
Oh, she can't!
No, she can't! He's too good looking!
And her husband's so awful!
I'm sorry, I'm more sorry than you are...
It's your turn.
Hello?
A message for who? Rock Thrust?
I'm sorry, but I think you have the wrong number.
That's OK. Bye.
Well, who was that?
Someone wanted Rock Thrust.
Rock Thrust? What a stupid name.
I know. Who would have a silly name like that?
Go, go, go, go, go!
It's a raid!
Don't move! Legs in the air!
Hands. Not legs, hands in the air.
Hands in the air!!!
Hello Nick. Hello Hector.
How did you know it was us?
Oh, lucky guess.
Great. It's like Piccadilly Circus here on a Friday night.
This apartment is very busy.
Crazy phone calls, crazy names and now the FBI!
So Bridget, darling, any messages for me?
What do you mean, messages?
Who do you think I am? Your secretary?
This is not your apartment. You do not live here.
I never have any privacy.
But they cut off my telephone.
That's not my problem. You should pay your bills.
Sorry, Bridget.
And Hector, you live with Nick now. Please knock on the door.
Now I want to be alone!
Well, that went well.
What's wrong with her?
Nick, what day is it? Wednesday.
And what time is it? I know. Half past six.
So... So...
So what's on television?
Oh, 'Love's True Dream'.
Love's True Dream. What is that?
"Oh, Alberto, Alberto!
I love you, I love you",
"And I love you too, Penelope".
Bridget's favourite programme. Yeah, and mine.
Oh, really, Annie? Why?
Because it's about the simple love of a boy
from Argentina and a girl from England.
Huh?
The simple love of a boy from Argentina and a girl from England.
Nice.
Oh, Hector! I love this advert.
What is it?
It's for chocolate mousse - shhh!
"Chocolate so smooth it will melt a beautiful lady's heart.
Chocolate mousse, the chocolate dessert for lov-ers".
Hmmm, I love chocolate mousse.
Hey! This advert's good too.
"Oooh, popcorn in the microwave,
popcorn in just seconds,
popcorn in your tummy,
they're pop-tastic!"
And do you like popcorn, Annie?
Oh yeah, especially pop-tastic popcorn.
Well, we don't have pop-tastic popcorn in Argentina,
but we make great popcorn. Yeah?
Yes, I'll make it in the frying pan.
Oh yes! Yes, great! I've got the part,
I've got the part!
Wow, man! That is great!
What is it?
Let's just say that my face will be on
your television every night at 6 o'clock
in front of a huge audience! O-ho! "Ladies and gentleman, a star is born!".
Oh, Nick, that's fantastic!
Ha-ha! This is it, Nick.
Today, London, tomorrow, Hollywood.
I'd just like to thank my parents, my brothers, my sisters
my dog, ...... is that...
and of course my adorable girlfriend,
Huh! I don't think so.
Anyway, what's going on?
Oh, it's wonderful news, Bridget.
Nick is going to be on television.
Well, tell us, Nick, what is it?
Well, it's on every night. It'll be hot.
Sometimes it'll be stormy.
will you still love me when I'm a superstar?
Yes, Nick, and I'm going to help you to be a great superstar.
Yes!!!
Lesson number one:
This is how all superstars make a big exit.
Goodbye, Nick. See you at the Oscars.
Annie? Uh-huh?
I really think you're watching too many adverts.
What do you mean, too many adverts
Well, remember Chunky Chunks?
Oh, Chunky Chunks.
Hello and welcome to the Chunky Chunks challenge!
Nick, in front of you are two plates.
And all you have to do is tell me which plate is Chunky Chunks!
A or B.
Ready? OK.
This is Plate A.
Good. And this is Plate B.
OK, Nick. Which plate do you think was Chunky Chunks? A or B?
Well, they both smelled great.
Correct! Well done!
Both plates were Chunky Chunks!
By the way, Annie. Uh-huh?
What are Chunky Chunks?
Dog food, of course.
Do you see what I mean? I think so.
What's... What's that noise?
Oh, Annie's popcorn.
My popcorn? Yes, I wanted to make popcorn just for you.
Oh Hector, thank you. Oh, you are sweet.
I like popcorn too, Hector.
Ah, I co-starred with Russell Crowe in this one.
You, in Gladiator?
Wow, Nick, I didn't realise. What were you?
The centurion.
Which centurion?
Ah! Here it is.
There, that's me, on the ground.
Huh! A dead centurion.
Yeah, good, eh? I had some words, but they were cut.
What did you say?
Hey, but now I've got the whole script just for me on television every night.
Nick, tell me, what is it?
It's my show.
When I'm a star, I will not forget you, my friend.
...Join me at 5.30 PM today
when I'll show you how to make a delicious chocolate mousse,
a dessert for lovers.
You'll need chocolate, eggs and butter.
And don't forget the way to a heart is through the stomach.
The way to the heart is through the stomach.
What does that mean?
It means if you want a girlfriend, cook for her.
I want to learn how to cook.
Anyway, what do you mean by I watch too many adverts?
Well, remember when you wanted us to change our washing powder?
Oh, ho! Hello there.
As a mother, I must fight difficult stains every day.
Tomato ketchup.
Chocolate - huh!
Gravy!
And - huh! Egg.
But help is here!
I will wash one shirt in ordinary washing powder
and the other in new Zap!
So, the shirt washed in normal washing powder is...
Oh! Still dirty,
but the shirt washed in new Zap is …
Oh!
Annie, have you seen my red T-shirt anywhere?
Oops!
See what I mean?
Oh, hello, Bridget. Hello, Hector.
Oh, hi, Annie.
Oh, thank you. Yes, I know
Do you know where Nick is?
No, we've just arrived. I'm a great actor.
I think I know where Nick is.
.....Would love to do the part, but I'm too busy.
No, it's not the money,
I don't need 15 million quid.
Look, talk to my agent, Bridget, huh?
I have an idea.
Oh, so Robert de Niro said yes already.
Hello?
Hello? Nick Jessop?
Yeah.
I have an executive from Warner Brothers on the line for you.
Right.
Hello Nick.
You are very big in England.
What are you working on now?
Hi. Well, it's something that all of England watches.
It's the...
You can laugh, but tomorrow night at 6 o'clock,
you will see that Nick from next door has star quality
and then Spielberg will call.
Now excuse me, I must learn my line.
CHARLOTTE [TV VOICE] Hello all you gorgeous chefs.
And welcome to Charlotte's Kitchen.
Today - hmmm! - chocolate mousse, a dessert for lovers.
First, take some chocolate.
And melt it over hot water.
Melt?
Oh! Over hot water.
Now, my darlings, you must separate the eggs into two bowls.
Separate the eggs?
Separate the yolk from the white.
Oh, the, the...
Hector? Ah, hello, Annie.
Mix the yolk and the chocolate.
Add the butter.
And now for the fun - whisking!
I love whisking, don't you?
Oh, whisking? Ah! You need Annie's magic whisk.
Yes, please.
Nearly finished, my darlings.
Finally, add the whites to the chocolate
and put it in the fridge.
And in 30 minutes,
this delicious chocolate mousse will be ready for your lover to taste - hmm!
And put it in the fridge - mwahh!
Why Hector, who's the lucky lady?
I think I know!
Chocolate mousse, my favourite dessert.

Six o'clock. Quick! Change channels!
VOICE ON TELEVISION It's 6 o'clock and time for the weather with Rock Thrust!
With Rock Thrust!
Oh, me. Oh, I'm ready.
The weather? Rock Thrust?
Nick!
Hi! I'm Rock Thrust.
And here is the weather - big smile.
And here is the weather.
In the south, it will be hot. (Sun, sun.)
Oh, sorry. Hot.
So put on your beach clothes.
And in the west, it'll be windy.
And in the east, it will rain,
so, don't forget your ummm... brella - ha!
And there could be some....
Oh, no, not lightning.
Ha! And that's the weather with me, Rock Thrust.
Ah, come in and sit down.
Close your eyes.
Now, are you ready for a taste of paradise?
Chocolate so smooth
it will melt a beautiful lady's heart.
Ready?
Hmmm!
"Chocolate mousse, the chocolate dessert for lovers".
Oh, Hector, that was so much fun!
I love doing adverts, especially with your delicious chocolate mousse.
Oh, I'm glad you like it.
Well, hello! It's Rock Thrust.
Would you like your messages, Mr Thrust?
As your agent, I take 10 per cent.
Oh, poor Nick. You must be very tired now.
Yeah, I am.
Working in television must be exhausting.
Yes, because I had to run all the way from the studio.
Run? Why?
Because I was chased.
Next time in EXTRA
Bridget wins the Lottery,
Nick finds love at the traffic lights
and why does Hector become a dustman?
This is the story of Bridget and Annie, who share a flat in London

Annie fancies Nick

who fancies Hector
But guess what. Hector fancies Annie
How are they going to solve their problems?
Stand by for Extra
More money! Ohhh! It's my lucky day.
Now where was I?
99, 100.
Good, that's done.
Now the cushions.
In my special order:
orange, pink, purple...
Hi, Bridget. Oh, hi Hector.
Hi, Annie.
I'm just... Bridget, no!
It's OK, Bridget, you didn't see it.
You didn't see it!
What are you wearing? Take it off!
What?
Your shirt, it's that colour.
Take it off.
This shirt? What is wrong with the colour? What's wrong with yell...
Don't say it! Don't say that colour. Just take it off
and throw it out!
OK, OK.
Done?
Done.
Bridget must not see anybody wearing that colour.
Why?
Because that colour - urghhh! -
is very unlucky for me and today is Lotto day!
Lotto day. What's...
The Lottery.
I pick 5 numbers.
My numbers are: 66, 11, 89, 18 and 69.
If my numbers are the same as the Lottery numbers on television,
I win millions!
I've never heard of it.
Bridget gets very excited.
But I know how to keep calm.
Yoga.
So, there we are, Hector.
Great. I am going shopping.
Do you need anything?
Yes. Could you get my dress from the dry cleaner's, please?
Dry cleaner's? OK.
The blue ticket is on the board.
Oh. Got it. See you later, Bridget.
4-6-4-7. Hector!
Hi, Nick.
I've just been to see Bridget.
Yes, I can see.
Anyway, where are you going?
Oh, I am going shopping.
Ah, yeah. Wait, wait, wait.
Come in here. 7-9-4-6-4-6-4-7. 7-9-4-6-4-6-4-7.
Pen, pen, I need a... aha!
pen. 7-9-4-6-4-6-4-7. Paper. Paper!
7-9-4-6-4-6-4-7. Hoo!
Thanks, Hector What is it?
Aha! Today I met a girl called Emily.
She is very beautiful - long blonde hair,
big... Yes?
...blue eyes,
and she is crazy about me.
Where did you meet her?
She was in her sports car.
At the traffic lights.
I asked her for a lift. She said "No!"
but she shouted her phone number
7-9-6-4-6-4-7.
Oh, I see.
Hey! Maybe she has a friend or a sister.
Wow, yeah!
Let's go out. Today is my lucky day.
VOICE ON TELEVISION Now it's time for the National Lottery.
Oh good. Is this my lucky day?
And the numbers are...
Yes? Oh, hello, Mother.
Yes, well, I'm a bit busy.
Can I call you... ... back?
Ahhh! I've won! Mum! I've won! I must go.
And those were this week's lucky numbers.
What is it?
Annie! Ahhhhh!
Bridget, I can't understand you!
Annie, I have won
the National Lottery!
From now on, it will be a life of luxury.
Designer clothes!
Exotic holidays!
Luxury homes!
The very best restaurants!
… Or mixing with the stars!
But of course I will give a lot of money to charity.
No more work, no more bosses.
In fact I'll call now and resign.
Hello, this is Harry Bowler.
Leave a message and I'll ring you back.
Harry, it's Bridget. I resign!
I quit! I'm off!
Keep your job. Goodbye!
Oh dear.
From now on, no more bosses for Bridget.
Bridget is the boss!
Now I'll just get my lucky little ticket.
What is it?
My Lottery ticket...
has disappeared.
What?!
But the dry cleaning ticket... is still there.
Hector has taken the wrong ticket.
We'll go to the dry cleaner's.
Hey, Nick, that waitress really likes you.
Two girls in one day.
Call me Mr. Irresistible, ooh-oh!
Hi, girls. Hi, Bridget.
Your dress, Bridget. I forgot, sorry. I...
how did you collect the cleaning
when I had the ticket?
No, Hector - darling.
You have the wrong ticket.
I have the wrong ticket?
You have the wrong ticket.
Now give it to me.
Yes, I have it here, Bridget.
You have got the ticket, Hector.
Yes, I have got the ticket, Bridget.
I have lost the ticket.
You have lost the ticket, Hector?
I have lost the ticket, Bridget.
You've lost the ticket, Hector.
You can't have lost the ticket!
Emily's number is on the back!
Are you OK, Bridget?
The ticket you took from the board
was not the dry cleaning ticket.
It was my Lottery ticket.
My winning Lottery ticket.
I am a multimillionaire.
But with no ticket!!!
And you,
you can stop smiling, because this is your fault too!
OK! Nick! Hector! Where have you been?
Well, first we went to the CD shop.
No, no, no. First we went to Leo's Café.
Remember the... waitress?
Oh yeah! She was ...
Yes, and...?
Then we went to the CD shop.
Then we went to Cool Man.
And then we went to the motorbike showroom.
Stop!
So, you are going back to look for it!
Yes, ma'am!
And don't come back until you've found it, OK?
OK!
The ticket must be claimed by 10 o'clock tonight.
Now get going!
Yeah, ... ... ...
Understood?
Understood!!!
You can say that again!
OK, Hector. I hope you find the ticket. See you later.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where are you going?
Well, I am going to the traffic lights. Emily might return.
I can't ring her, because her number is on the lost ticket, remember?
Yeah, but what shall I do?
Look for the ticket, of course.
Yeah, but what shall I say?
Well, you say...
OK, I am the shopkeeper. You are you.
Great! Great.
Good afternoon.
I have lost my ticket.
What sort of ticket?
Oh, my winning Lottery ticket.
Oh, your winning...wait a moment.
You can't say, "I have lost my winning Lottery ticket".
Why not?
Because if they know it is a winning Lottery ticket,
they will keep the money, they will hide it.
So you must be someone else.
Who?
Ha! Someone who can search the rubbish bins.
Search the rubbish bins?
That's it! A dustman.
Dustman?
Yeah! A dustman can search the rubbish bins.
Ha! Great idea, Nick.
Yeah, great idea, Nick.
Come on! You need to prepare!
Hello? Hello?
Hector... Hello, Bridget.
Have you found the ticket?
No, not yet.
Well, where's Nick?
At the traffic lights.
What?! At the traffic lights?
Well, call me when you've found the ticket!
Well, what?
Any luck?
Well, yes and no.
Yes and no?
Hmm. The bad news is, I didn't find her.
Who? Emily.
Emily who?
Emily, the girl at the traffic lights.
The good news is... Yes...
I made £50 cleaning windscreens.
Where's Hector?
Where's my ticket?
Oh, look at the time. It's ten to ten!
Ten to ten? I haven't fed Charlie.
Oh, where is Charlie? I must find him.
Charlie was asleep on my bed this afternoon.
Oh, thanks Nick.
Oh, there you are, Charlie.
Charlie?
What's this?
Bridget! Bridget! I found it! Your ticket!
What?! Where?
On Nick's bed.
Who? On Nick's bed!
Well, give it to me. No, give it to me!
It's my Lottery ticket. Emily's number's on the back!
It's mine! Give it to me!
It's OK, it's OK. I'll stick it back together.
Done! Uh!
Thank you! Ha!
Now I can claim my money!
Oh, poor Hector.
Oh, poor Hector!
I've just found the ticket on Nick's bed. Isn't it exciting!
Yeah, great.
I can call Emily now!
Oh, great!
When Bridget has finished.
Great!!!
Hello! I'd like to claim my prize money, please.
My numbers are: 66, 11, 89, 18 and 69.
What?!
What do you mean, they're not the winning numbers?
Well, what are your numbers then?
69, 81,
68, and 99?
But how?
Hey, I know what happened.
Bridget, what were you doing while watching the Lottery?
My yoga.
Which position?
This one.
Exactly.
These are your numbers, but
this way.
Oh, bravo, Hector.
Hey, it was nothing.
Aha! Emily's number.
7-9-4-6-4-6-4-7.
Aha, it's ringing.
Helloooo.
Is Emily there?
No?
Who are you?
Jack's Taxis?
Emily! You tricked me!
Oh, what an unlucky day.
Well, it can't get any worse.
Yes, it can.
The phone call.
My job.
We must get that tape back.
Now!
And I know just the men for the job.
Oh no!
Oh yes!
Nick, should we be here?
It's OK. Bridget said it was OK.
Look! There is the answerphone.
Quick, get the tape!
Security! Who's there?

I'll get a taxi from the airport. Love you, Chrissy.
No, mama, no es …
Mothers!
My mother thinks I am 10 years old.
My Mum treats me like a baby too.
My Mum doesn't understand me.
My Mum doesn't understand me,
but Chrissy is perfect.
Who is Chrissy? Oh, she's my sister.
Oh, excuse me.
Hi? Oh, hello Mother.
Yes Mother, I have remembered she's arriving today.
Oh, hi Nick. I've come to get my weights.
Ah, Mr Romero.
Take off your trousers and lie down, please.
Pardon, Nick?
Ah, please, call me Doctor Jessop.
Doctor Jessop?
Hector, I want a part in the TV show Hospital Fever.
I need to practise.
Anyway, women love men in white coats.
Really? Ha-ha-ha! So, where does it hurt?
Where does what hurt?
You are my patient so you must hurt somewhere.
OK, oh, my arm, my arm hurts.
Your leg or your arm? Leg, arm, arm, leg.
Oh, OK, my leg, my leg.
OK. Sit down please, Mr Romero. Hmm, cross your legs.
Ha! Now, don't worry, Mr Romero, this won't hurt at all.
Sorry, Nick, it was an accident.
OK. You...
have good reflexes.
Good.
Now, Mr Romero,
please say "Ah!"
Mmm, I thought so.
What?
You had cornflakes for breakfast.
Now I must give you an injection.
An injection?
Yes, an injection!
It's open.
Chrissy!! You're early. Come in, come in!
Twinnies!
Oh Bridget, darling, it's lovely to see you.
And you, Chrissy.
How was your flight?
Great, but can you believe it,
they lost my luggage.
Incredible.
Oh Chrissy, look at you. You never change.
You're still a teenager.
Oh, didn't we have fun then.
Yeah, at school.
We shared everything.
Yes, we did.
Anyway, here we are now.
Bridget,
do you have some clothes I could borrow?
I travelled in this dress.
I need something more comfortable.
Something like this? I bought two for the price of one.
Bridget, this looks really good.
Great.
Sorry, I can't exercise. I've hurt my back.
Why, Hector. You are so muscular.
Oh, thanks.
How is your Mum?
She is such a good friend. She really understands me.
But I thought that...
It's OK. I'm here.
Where's the emergency?
Well, hello, Nick,
the actor.
Ooh, I love doctors.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Hello, Mummy.
This is it! Women love doctors. Bridget...
can't resist me.
Really?
Hey, darling, come to Nick.
See you soon, Mummy. Love you lots. Bye!
So Doctor, where were we?
Ooh, I think I have a temperature.
Madam, I think I can help.
Tell me where it hurts. Hi, Hector!
Hi, Nick!
Hi, Bridget!
Annie, darling!
How are you?
Doesn't Nick look good as a doctor?
Yes, he looks
very,
very good.
Now you must excuse me, I must do my make-up.
Bridget is in a really strange mood today.
A moment ago, she said that her mother was her best friend.
So?
But an hour ago, she said that her mother treated her like a baby.
I am confused.
I wonder what Bridget was like when she was younger.
I wonder what Annie was like.
I wonder what Nick was like.
Nick?
Huh! I know what Hector was like.
Anyway, I must continue rehearsing as Doctor Jessop,
especially as Bridget loves doctors so much.
Ohhh! Nick only likes Bridget, Bridget, Bridget.
Am I interrupting?
No. Yes.
Excuse me!
But why?
Nick never notices me.
Ohhh! And he looks so handsome in his doctor's coat.
Really?
Sweet!
But I thought that …
… Your faces! Are you two … ?
No! Yes.
Aw, but you look so nice together.
So Hector,
are you and Annie dating?
Well...
Come on, Hector.
You can tell me. It's not a problem.
Really?
Really!
OK.
I really like Annie.
Go on. But
she doesn't notice me.
Well, ask her on a date.
Wow, should I?
OK.
Oh, and Hector,
when I was at the airport today, I found this magazine.
Airport?
Is this you?
Are you this rich boy, Hector?
Yeah, but please, don't tell Annie.
you want her to like you,
not your money.
Yeah.
That is so sweet.
Well, don't you worry.
Your secret is safe with me.
Oh, thanks.
Bridget is in a really good mood today!
Really?
Gre-at!
Hi!
Hi, Nick darling, or Dr Jessop.
Would you help me?
Sure.
Would you move this exercise bike to give me more space?
Sure.
Oh, you're so strong.
I ... need a drink.
Would you... like one?
Yes, please.
Bridget, darling.
Have you finished, because now
we can make a little sweet music of our own, darling.
In your dreams, Nick.
Who moved my bike?
I did, because you...
Well, move it back then - if you're strong enough.
Dr Romero, at your service.
Ooh, hello!
Oh, Hector, you look great!
Oh, I love doctors.
Hi, Annie.
Oh, hi, Hector.
Hector, think of a card.
OK, ace of diamonds.
No, don't tell me.
Annie?
Yes, Hector?
I have something to ask you.
Yes, Hector?
The thing is,
do you like to come to the cinema tomorrow night with me?
Pardon?
Would you like to come to the cinema tomorrow night
- with me?
Oh, well, yes,
I'd like to.
OK.
See you then.
So Annie,
did Hector ask you out?
To the cinema, yes.
Do you want to come?
Of course not!
Have a great time!
I wonder which film we should see.
When?
When I go to the cinema with Hector, of course.
What?
You and Hector are going to the cinema?
I don't believe it.
Phew, I'm starving!
Hmm! These are my favourite biscuits.
I think there are some good films on now, Annie.
All the films are rubbish at the moment anyway.
I'm starving.
Ecchh! I hate these biscuits.
Now I must phone the airport.
I don't understand.
If you are there,
then who is in the bathroom?
Annie, what are you doing?
But...
you're … ! … Twins.
Bridget, I didn't know!
This is my twin sister Chrissy.
Didn't I tell you about her?
Now I understand.
So Nick and Hector don't know that you are twins.
No, I don't think so.
You know,
we could have some fun with this …
Maybe a magic trick?
Hector! Nick! Come in!
You are just in time to see my new magic trick.
Take a seat.
Wow, I can't wait.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Oh, just gentlemen.
Today I will make my lovely assistant Bridget disappear!
Enter, Bridget!
OK, Bridget, in you go.
Bridget.
Bridget!
I will make Bridget disappear from this box and appear in this box.
Oh, this I must see.
Now a tap with the magic wand.
Which means that the first box is empty.
Bridget, you are moving quickly today.
Let's just check that the other box is empty.
Hey! She's going round the back.
OK, gentlemen, place your bets, please.
Which box do you think Bridget is in?
The box on the left. No, no, the box on the right.
OK. Let's see.
A drum roll, please.
Gentlemen, applause, please, for Bridget and Chrissy!
I think there's something wrong with the audience.
Is there a doctor in the house?
Bye, Chrissy, come back again soon!
I will, I promise.
Bye, Bridget.
Oh, Chrissy, I'll miss you.
Oh! She forgot her magazine.
What?!
It can't be!
It is! It's Hector!
Next time in EXTRA,
Hector helps build some new shelves,
Nick helps build some new shelves,
and what happens when the landlady's cousin comes to stay?
This is the story of two girls who share a flat in London
and the boys next door, Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina
Bridget is interested in Hector
but Hector is very interested in Annie
Annie doesn't know
So will he get close enough to tell her?
Find out in Extra
"Dear Tenants,
my cousin, your landlady, is on holiday this week,
so I am in charge.
The same rules apply:
no pets, no parties, no visitors, especially boys.
Yours, Eunice Mountain."
Eunice Mountain? She sounds terrible!
Worse than the tarantula.
If that's possible.
Do you think she'll say no shelves?
She can't. They'll look fantastic.
"The timber shelves in clear lacquered beech veneer
with six castors
and a TV bench."
Ooh! Now, where shall we begin?
Annie, it's easy.
Rule number one: always read the instructions first.
Well, that will only take a week.
OK, let's have a drink before we begin.
Milk, Annie? Yes, please.
"I owe you, Nick."
There! Well, no milk. Would you like some sparkling water?
Right.
"I owe you, Nick."
"I owe you, Nick."
"I owe you, Nick!"
How dare he?
Would you like some cola? Thanks, Bridget, I was looking for that.
Nick!
Huh? Sorry.
Add it to the list.
Or ask your flat mate to buy your food.
Wow!
You didn't know Hector was rich? No.
I'll speak to you later!
Wow, what are all these boxes?
Our new shelves, Hector.
I can help you build them. Where are the instructions?
Hector, my friend, rule number one:
never read the instructions.
Ohhh, I see you have a note from our new landlady then.
Eunice Mountain!
Eunice Mountain. I bet she's the same size.
Hello? It's Eunice Mountain.
Who am I? I'm Nick, from Flat B.
Oh, you want Flat A? This is...
Hello? Hello? Yes, this is Flat A.
Yes, I am Nick from Flat B.
Yes, I know this isn't my flat.
I want to see you downstairs - now!
Sorry. OK. Right away.
Well?
Eunice Mountain wants to see me downstairs now.
Oh, bad luck, man.
Oh dear.
Ask her if she has any milk, bread and biscuits.
OK,
so: "First open box A and take out shelf number 1."
But which is box A?
This is box C.
And I've got box D.
Ah, I've got it. This is shelf number 1.
No, Hector. This is shelf number 1.
No, this is shelf number 1.
Oh, this is a nightmare.
OK, Annie, read out the instructions.
"Put shelf 1 against the wall."
Hector, I think the books will fall off.
So what's Eunice Mountain like?
You know, not bad.
Are you in trouble?
Probably.
I've got it!
Put pole B on the left and pole A on the right
and the shelf on top. Bridget.
Like this, Hector?
Have you put up shelves before, Hector?
Many times.
Or do your servants do it for you?
I'll do it! No, no, no, I'll do it.
Drop! Drop!
Ha! I laugh at instructions.
Oh, that was clever.
It's OK. I can straighten it.
Stand back and watch the master at work!
Oh, well done, Nick.
So where does this piece go?
Hi,
I'm Eunice Mountain, your new landlady.
Hello. I...
I,
I am Bridget,
and this is Annie.
Hello.
And this is Hector from Argentina.
Well, hello, Heloo, Hector.
Hector lives next door with Nick.
I've met Nick already, haven't I, Nick.
Oh yes, that's right.
we need to talk about your rent... in private.
Gre-at - uhhh!!
"Measure the distance between the shelves."
Annie, hold this, please.
Aha, that's it, uh-huh.
And this should be it!
Hector, do you think that's correct?
These shelves are for mice.
Can I speak to you please, Hector?
So, Hector,
one of the richest families in Argentina, the Romero family.
There you are, Hector!
So why the secret?
Because I wanted you to like me, not my money.
Oh Hector, of course I do.
Who else knows?
Nick.
I thought so.
But not Annie. Don't tell Annie - yet.
Why, Hector?
Because Bridget, I
... because... Yes?
I am in love with Annie.
Nick has entered the building!
So where are you going looking like John Travolta?
He has a date with me, haven't you, darling.
Another date?
But that's three times this week!
Four.
We've been to dinner, to the theatre, to the cinema
and last night... salsa dancing!
Can you salsa?
I am the salsa queen!
Yeah, with two left feet.
Pardon? Nothing.
It sounds great.
What is it tonight? Ping pong?
Tonight's it's karaoke.
And I am the karaoke queen!
Let's go. Bye!
"I love yo-u-u!"
"I am the karaoke queen!"
I bet she sings like a toad.
So, Hector, where were we?
OK, I think I've got it, Annie.
I did knock, but the music was so loud, you didn't hear me.
I thought we'd have a little chat.
Rule number two: no underwear on the radiator.
it's dry now. Give it to me.
Give it to.... thank you.
Let me repeat the rules.
No parties and no visitors,
especially boys.
Especially boys from next door.
Especially... ...Nick!
He's mine!
Get the message?
Erm, yeah, we get the message.
See you later.
Oh, by the way, that shelf is not straight.
Bye!
Well, I have never!
What does she... who does she think she is?
The landlady's cousin?
Oooh, I know that, but no Hector and no Nick?
How dare she?
How is Eunice?
Problems?
She is very nice.
But?
But... she's just not my type.
What do you mean?
Look, presents.
More presents. Flowers. More presents. Chocolate.
And her energy! I'm exhausted!
Nick!
Coo-eee! Let's go dancing!
Hector, get rid of her!
Get rid of her? How?
Say something! What shall I say?
Anything! Tell her I'm not well.
I've eaten a hedgehog. I've gone to the moon.
Oh, Nick, are you in there?
Go on! OK, OK!
Oh, hi.
You're not Nick.
No. Nick...Nick's hedgehog has gone to the moon.
Pardon?
Nick's hedgehog is not well. Nick is sad.
So, he must come dancing to make him happy.
No, no! He cannot dance!
Why not?
He stood on the hedgehog without shoes.
Very painful.
Oh, very messy! So he cannot dance.
Oh, that's a pity.
Well, never mind.
Yeah, sorry. Bye.
You'll just have to come instead!
Pardon?! Come on, let's dance!
"And tighten the screws."
Annie, you are a genius.
Hi, Hector. Hi, Annie.
What's the matter? Are you OK?
I am exhausted.
What happened?
Last night, Eunice and I... Yes?
She made me... Yes?
… Go dancing.
Oh!
Annie, she dances like a rhinoceros.
Whoa! Annie!
The shelves! You finished them!
Oh, just a bit more measuring.
I will help you.
Sorry... No, sorry...
Sorry...
It's OK. It happens when people work together.
Ah! "For the final shelf, take..."
oh! Hector!
Help! Hide me!
Eunice? Eunice.
Oh Bridget, save me!
Why? It's Eunice.
Nick! Coo-eee! Oh, Nick
Oh, there she is! She's too much!
I know you are in there, Nick.
Bridget, Annie, I said no boys.
Shall I get rid of her, Nick?
Oh, yes, please! But how?
I'll think of something. Annie, let Miss Mountain in.
there you are, Nick.
And Hector!
Bridget, I thought I said no boys.
Yes, you did!
Especially boys from next door.
Yes, yes, you did!
Especially … … Nick, he's mine!!
Oh...Nick!
Well … I... just wait until I tell my cousin!
Oh, by the way, Hector, I've got a fax for you.
Oh? Oh, please, give it to me
It's from your father. It says,
"Coming to London to meet... the Prime Minister
My jet arrives at midday. Will phone. Father."
Ooh! Actually, Hector, I think you're more my type.
I don't think so, Eunice.
Goodbye. Oh, and don't slam the... door.
So Hector, your father is flying to London in his private jet to meet the Prime Minister?
Well, they are one of the richest families in Argentina.
So Bridget, where were we? No, Nick.
The trick worked. Eunice is gone.
Annie, I will buy you a million shelves.
we'd better start measuring for them then.
Next time in EXTRA,
Nick dresses up,
Bridget is working hard in television
and Hector goes for an audition!
This is the story of Bridget and Annie, who share a flat in London
and the boys next door, Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina
Hector and Annie are dating
and Hector's English is getting better and better
Nick fancies Bridget
but...well, Bridget does not fancy Nick
Stand by for Extra
To be or not to be,
that is the question.
Whe..., oh no!
Why is it so dark in here? What's going on?
Nick, what are you doing? The sun is shining outside.
Oh, hi, Annie.
What are you doing? Nothing.
Well, stand up then. I can't.
Why not?
Right, I'm coming over.
No ... ..... OK.
Oh, nice outfit, Nick!
Bridget, look at this!
Oh, you can laugh,
but one day, I... will be a great actor.
In fact, I might get a part in a Shakespeare production this week.
Oh, In your dreams!
Did you have a good day at work, Bridget?
Oh, I'm so tired.
Training with the England football team this morning.
Oh, those boys - so cheeky!
But they really know what they're talking about.
Football?
No. Hairstyles and fashion, of course.
Anyway, then I had lunch with Kylie Minogue's agent - lovely man.
So funny! I'm exhausted. Oh!! Poor Bridget.
Euch, I must get changed.
Now Bridget's a researcher for Channel Nine, all she talks about is sweet stars.
Huh! Bleuhh! It's so boring.
Huh? I'll be sweet when I'm famous.
Where are they?
I thought so.
"To die... to sleep …"
Nick! ... ......?
Are those my tights? No. Huh!
Oh yes they are!
Oh, these tights. Are they yours, Bridget?
I'll speak to you later. Now where's Hector?
I have some exciting news for him.
Oh, hi, Bridget.
Hi, sugar-plum!
Hi, snugly-puppykins!
Hey, nice tights, man!
Hector, I have some great news for you.
Channel Nine is looking for a television reporter.
Ah - I could do that!
Not an English reporter. A Latin American who speaks English.
But I can't speak English very well. Just audition.
Go on, Hector, the camera will love you.
And so will the girls!
Not all the girls, I hope.
Well, if you think so, then...
Ah, Hector, with my help, the job is yours.
And my new boss will be very impressed with me.
OK, Bridget.
Right! Let's do some research.
Annie, we need CNN. Find it. And Nick
Yes? I want my tights back. Now!
OK.
You want your tights back?
They are Versace. The remote, please, Annie.
Alas, poor Yorick.
I knew him, Horatio.
What's wrong with it?
I don't know. I think it's broken.
Well, we'll have to go to your place then.
Ah! There you are.
We're watching CNN.
We're doing research for Hector's new job
Hector's new job? What about my new job?
I need to do research as well.
Nick!
There! That's better.
To be or not to be...
What's this? Hamlet - a tragedy.
What's it about?
Love. Madness. And murder.
Hamlet's father, the king, is killed...ugh by Hamlet's uncle,
who then marries...
Hamlet's mother, so
Hamlet kills his uncle and his mother and then... he dies.
That sounds like my family.
It's a masterpiece. I'd be great as Hamlet.
Oh! My tights!
Oh, Bridget, I had an accident.
Buy me another pair or you will have an accident!
Accident or murder?!
OK, Bridget.
Right, I'm off.
Me too.
Goodnight, sugar-plum. Night, snuggly-puppykins.
Oh, Nick, I am worried.
Hector, I know what you mean.
When women talk like that, it is time to move on.
No, not Annie. This television reporter's job.
I don't really think I can do it.
Hector, of course you can.
What you need is...
Talent? No! You don't need talent.
You need Nick's School for Television Reporters.
Nick's School for Television Reporters?
Yeah! I will teach you to be a television reporter.
OK! OK.
Rule number one:
imagine you are talking to a beautiful woman.
Good evening,
this is Nick Jessop, reporting from the Houses of Parliament just for you.
Rule number two: be mysterious.
I am here to tell you the Houses of Parliament may look normal,
but all is not as it seems.
Rule number three:
make them trust you.
I can reveal that this building is actually an alien space station.
Trust me. Trust Nick Jessop.
I will always tell you the truth.
See you later. Goodnight and... sleep tight.
Do it like that, Hector, and you will get the job.
Hi, this is Hector Romero.
Did you get my fax?
Well, did you get my email?
What did Sting say? Will he do the interview?
You won't even ask him?
He's never heard of Channel Nine? Oh, please. Please!
Please!
Well can I meet him?
I can?
Where is he?
At the airport? I'll be there.
Yes!
Hector Romero for you, Bridget.
No.
Hector, I forgot your audition.
Listen, I must go out for one hour. Sting wants to see me!
Don't worry.
Just remember everything I've told you.
Here's the script, there's the camera.
Must dash! Be back in an hour!
But... I...
Hello, this is Hector Romero for Channel Nine.
What a day!
First Sting had already departed for New York and now this!
This! From you, Hector!
Sorry, Bridget.
Was this Nick's idea?
I thought so.
So, have I got the job?
What do you think?
Goodbye, Hector.
And the new editor will be here soon.
Right! Nick!
Nick... I am too angry to speak. Bridget.
Hi, Bridget! Nick.
I thought you were too angry to speak to me.
Shut up, Nick. How dare you.
How dare I what?
Teach Hector to be a news reporter!
Ah, ahm, sorry, Bridget. He was ridiculous.
"Hi, sexy, this is Hector Romero."
My new editor will be here soon and I wanted to impress her.
So will Hector get the job then?
Of course he won't get the job. You made me look a fool. You...
you and Hector are so stupid!
Who was that?
Wrong number. Hey, Nick, look at this.
This could be perfect for you. What is it?
Is Shakespeare in your blood?
Could you be our Hamlet?
Yeah!
Do you love performing? Yeah!
Do you love travelling? Yeah!
Do people adore you? Naturally!
Then we need you.
Call this number for a Shakespearean experience.
Hamlet!
My dream!
I'll call now.
I must learn my lines.
To be...
to be...
Or not to be?
Hello, Bridget.
Eunice, what are you doing here?
Long time no see, Bridget.
And how's Nick? Does he miss me?
No. Er, yes.
You have a new hairstyle.
Yeah. So have you.
Yes, but the difference is, mine looks good.
Yes.
Anyway, Bridget,
I am your new editor.
Surprised?
No, no, no.
Good.
OK. Two rules.
One: I am your editor and I am always right.
Two: you are the researcher, you are always wrong. OK?
OK!
Now what have you got for me today?
Sting would love to come for an interview, but...
But he's not coming.
No.
But we need a new reporter and...
and...
and I have found you the most perfect person.
He's Latin American, speaks English and he's very sexy.
Watch this. I know you'll love him.
Hi, sexy. This is Hector Romero for Channel Nine.
Wow, you look beautiful today.
Guess what? There's been a diamond robbery in London.
I would love to put diamonds on those pretty ears.
But you, yes, you... can sleep safely in your bed tonight.
This is Hector Romero.
I'll be back.
Well?
Of course! Hector! Oh, he is perfect!
I'm sure you would have been a very good reporter.
But Bridget is angry with me.
Huh! Don't worry about Bridget.
Guess what? I've got the job.
Hamlet? Shakespeare? Congratulations, man!
Oh, great! When do you start?
Tonight. I've got the costume already.
I think I will go and wash my motorbike.
You haven't got a motorbike.
I have now. Hi, everyone!
Hector, you have a visitor.
My new editor!
Eunice, do you remember Hector?
Hmm. How could I forget?
And of course Nick!
I could never forget you!
I thought you had a motorbike to wash?
Thank you.
Hector,
I just popped in to say...
congratulations. You've got the job!
Isn't it wonderful?
Eunice really liked your tape.
Oh, you are perfect, Hector. Hector, we'll have such fun.
I'm off. Oh, see you at 8 o'clock sharp tomorrow morning, Hector.
Oh, hmm! There's no need to thank me, Hector.
Oh, I think I've got something in my eye.
Well, it was nice while it lasted,
but now, Annie, it is time to say goodbye to Hector.
He is going to be a famous news reporter,
so there'll be no room for little, old... you.
It's OK, Annie.
Whatever happens, we will always be together.
But you'll forget me when you're a famous news reporter.
However many stories I report,
murders, bank robberies, small cats in trees,
I shall never forget you.
You, light of my life.
This is Hector Romero for Channel Nine, London.
Oh, Hector!
Oh, Annie!
Oh no.
Nick? Yes? No! Ohh...
To eat or not to eat?
That is the question.
Hamlet's burgers, eat them, without question.
Next time in EXTRA,
Annie wants to save the animals,
Bridget has a date with Leonardo di Caprio,
and what is in Nick's box?
EXTRA, don't miss it.
This is the story of Bridget and Annie, who share a flat in London,
and the boys next door, Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.
Bridget has a job with Channel 9
and so does Hector, he's a reporter.
Annie just wants to save the animals
and Nick... Well, Nick is Nick.
Stand by for Extra.
What?
- Nick! - Who is it?
It's me. Annie.
And this is Ziggy.
- Is Hector there? - No.
- He's working tonight. - Then you must help us, Nick.
Take these.
They are my babies, so look after them, please!
Sure, no problem.
Right. Ready, Ziggy?
Come on, let's go.
Hurry!
Yes, three o'clock. Tell the others.
Bye.
'Animals are human?'
Annie, animals are animals.
- But animals are like people. - Really, Annie?
Look at this flat. How can I get ready?
- Sorry, Bridget. - I have a very important day today.
- Sorry. - I have big, big decisions to make.
Like...which dress.
What do you think?
They're both nice.
I have such a busy morning.
David Beckham, Madonna.
What? You're meeting them?
No, I'm reading about them
and then I'm having lunch with guess who.
Yes, you've guessed it.
Leonardo DiCaprio!
Leonardo and me!
Wow! Leonardo DiCaprio?
Just you and him?
Well, nearly.
There'll be 45 journalists there too
but really it's just me and gorgeous Leo.
You and 45 others?
I see.
Anyway, this cosmetic factory experiments on animals for make- up
and I really feel...
Good, Hector, you're here. Now you can help me choose.
You're back, Hector.
Was it a difficult night at work, snuggly puppykins?
Yes, and the bad news is that Eunice wants me to go straight back.
Why?
There is a big news story happening today.
So, Hector,
which dress do you like the best?
This one.
- You're sure? - OK, that one.
But you just said this one first.
Yes, I know, but...
Bridget, I am going to Channel 9 now.
- Are you coming? - Yes, Hector.
And I can tell you all about Leonardo and me!
The guinea pigs!
Nick?
Good. They're OK.
I'm coming.
Ziggy, come in.
Right, now, there are the posters.
Now, a note for Nick.
Ready, Ziggy?
Bye, Charley. Wish us luck.
Wait a minute, Ziggy.
OK, right, let's go.
Wish us luck.
Yes, three o'clock. Tell the others.
Bye.
Leonardo and me!
Wow!
Leonardo DiCaprio?
I have big, big decisions to make.
Which dress?
Hector. At last.
I want you to go straight to Garrier's cosmetic factory.
Why?
Because some horrid hippies are protesting there.
Why?
Because they think Mr Garrier experiments on guinea pigs for make- up.
This is nonsense.
Guinea pigs?
You know,
guinea pigs.
Guinea pigs! How sweet.
And these hippies have stolen his guinea pigs.
Poor Mr Garrier adores his little guinea pigs.
He wants them back.
He told me over dinner last night.
Who is Mr Garrier?
Mr Garrier owns Channel 9.
And Mr Garrier has said
we must make these protesters look very, very stupid.
Now get going!
OK, Eunice.
I want their heads!
Eunice?
Yes, Bridget?
Is there anything I can do?
Yes.
I have a very important job for you.
Get me a coffee. Black, no sugar.
No, Bridget.
I can't, I'm a married man.
What?
Crazy, man!
Guinea pigs!
They are my babies, so look after them, please.
Yeah, sure, no problem.
Yeah.
Annie.
Annie!
OK, my little beauties.
Time for breakfast.
Come on.
'Nick, very important. Keep my babies safe. I will call you. Annie.'
Does she think I'm stupid?
Of course you're safe with me.
Now, let me introduce myself.
My name is Nick.
Yeah, hello there.
Now, what's your name?
Kevin? How do you do, Kevin?
And who's this?
Janice?
Is she your girlfriend, Kevin?
OK, it's not that funny.
Janice, I think you're very pretty, OK?
So!
These are all your friends.
Wow!
There are eight of you.
You must be hungry.
Shall Uncle Nick get you something nice to eat?
OK.
Have they split up?
Hollywood's most beautiful couple.
Yes!
Yes!
Garrier out! Garrier out!
All right, Eunice, I cannot hear you.
I said,
find the leader.
The what?
The coordinator.
Which one?
Her, her! That one!
The one with the big ears.
Garrier out! Garrier out!
- Hello. - Hello.
This isn't a tea party. Ask her a question.
OK.
So how important is this protest?
Well...
Well, yes, it's very important
because this factory, Garrier's, experiments on animals for make- up.
And why is that bad?
Because the poor...
Because the poor animals are suffering.
That's dreadful. The poor things.
Poor little things.
They're just guinea pigs!
Hector, remember who Mr Garrier is?
You do want your job.
OK, OK.
OK, so do you think this march will help the animals?
It's Hector and Annie.
- This march is important. - Wow, man!
We must stop Mr Garrier!
I see.
These scientists are using poor animals to test on hair dye,
lipstick, mascara, blusher.
They use...
Well, tell her. Tell her...we need make- up!
And where are the eight guinea pigs they stole from the laboratory?
I bet she knows. Ask her.
Ask her.
OK.
And do you know anything about...some stolen guinea pigs?
The guinea pigs are safe.
Yeah, they're safe with me.
Aren't you, my pretty ones?
I bet she's got those guinea pigs.
- Ask her! Ask her! - OK.
Have you...
Louder, you idiot!
Have you got...
We've got her! Ask her again! Ask her again!
Have you got the guinea pigs?
Hector, why are you doing this?
You know I love animals.
I'm sorry, Annie. It's my job.
Well, you can keep your job!
Annie, please! Wait, I'm coming!
This is Hector Romero for Channel 9 News.
Annie, please! I can explain.
Wait!
OK, my little beauties.
They're safe with me.
Aren't you, my pretty ones?
Have you got the guinea pigs?
Hector, why are you doing this?
This is Hector Romero for Channel 9 News.
Annie, please, I can explain. Wait!
Bridget DiCaprio.
Mrs Leonardo DiCaprio.
Leonardo and Bridget DiCaprio.
'Hello, Mrs DiCaprio!'
'Call me Bridget.'
'Is Leonardo there?'
'No,
'he's on the beach with our two beautiful children and the dogs.'
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
So aren't you going to ask me about my lunch?
- What did you do that for? - Aren't you going to ask me about my lunch?
- What lunch? - My lunch with Leonardo.
Leonardo who?
Leonardo DiCaprio, of course.
So, Bridget, how was your lunch with Leonardo DiCaprio?
Gorgeous!
I was so funny.
He loved me, he loved my dress, he loved my name.
- That's nice. - Now close your eyes.
Go on, close your eyes.
Ready?
What do you think?
- Very nice. - It was very expensive
but it's worth it because tonight I'm going to a premiere.
I can't wait!
I wonder if Leonardo will be there. Now I must get ready.
Tonight this little lady's going to shine
Tonight this little lady's going to shine
Annie, I can explain. Listen.
Annie, please talk to me.
Hey, guys. Great interview.
You were not fair, Hector.
- You were asking awful questions. - Yeah, they were pretty bad.
It wasn't me.
It was Eunice.
The guinea pigs!
Nick, where are they? I must take them to the animal sanctuary.
We've been having a lovely time, haven't we, my friends?
Hello. They're not here.
What do you mean, they're not here?
I mean, they're not here.
So where are they, Nick?
Everywhere?
I'll get it.
Hello.
Hi, Eunice.
Yes, Eunice.
OK, Eunice.
No, Eunice.
OK, Eunice. Bye, Eunice.
- It was Eunice! - No!
And after what happened today,
she says that I...
Hector!
Your job! She's fired you!
I'm so sorry, Hector.
It's all my fault.
She says that I must tell you
that she is so pleased with the interview,
she wants Channel 9 to fight against animal cruelty.
Channel 9's new motto is...
Animals are human.
That's fantastic news!
Good old Eunice.
What about Mr Garrier?
She said, 'Don't worry about Mr Garrier.'
- Right, let's find those guinea pigs. - Yes, right away.
Right, we've found seven of them.
There's just one guinea pig still missing.
He's probably watching us.
Yeah, and laughing at us.
Hello?
OK, right.
- Bridget, your taxi's here. - I'm coming.
New girlfriend, Nick?
Right, everyone,
I'm just off to my premiere.
Did I mention it?
Proper acting.
Perhaps you could learn something, Nick.
Sorry.
No spare ticket.
Still, I'll tell you all about it later.
Bye.
Don't wait up.

Travelling by plane, by train, and by car.

What I need, what I really need is a holiday.
Go on, type New York.
Gatwick.
Number of nights, 3.
3.
OK, let's see what they can do.
One thousand pounds?!
Oh, but that's much too expensive - we, we must choose a different destination.
Yeah, how about Las Vegas, hah!
But that would cost even more, don't be silly, Nick.
What? Is Nick being silly? I don't believe it!
Oh, I'm so tired!
Oh Hector, I saw your holiday report.
Oh, I have just spent all day watching other people go on holidays.
Oh, I can't go on!
Eunice is a witch.
She makes me work, work, work.
Why don't you leave then? Yeah.
What? Leave my job?
I love my job!
Huh! Women!
What you need - what we all need is a …
Holiday!
Mmm, a holiday!
Gre-at idea!
Where shall we go?
Oh, I'd love to go to Las Vegas!
Cape Town!
I'd like to go anywhere with Enrique Iglesias!
Hey! What about Spain!
You speak Spanish! You can be our guide! Hah! We-ll …
Enrique Iglesias speaks Spanish!
And the girls … Hmm!
I can't wait!
Hey Hector, you can translate my chat up lines!
Well, I'll try!
And we can try them out! Ha ha!
Yeah!
Hector!
There's your ironing!
Nick!
There's yours!
OK, I see a pretty Spanish girl …
… How do I say: "I'm English, can you give me directions - to your apartment?"
Really? Yeah.
OK.
Good, but this one is better.
Your eyes are like stars -
they come out at night.
Oh, I like it!
How do I say it in Spanish?
That's what I said. OK!
Eh! Ha, ha! Now, this one always works.
I know what you're thinking.
You want to kiss me, don't you.
No, I don't.
Not you! It's the chat up line, stupid!
Hector, are you there?
Sure.
Ay?!! All of it?!!
Yes, all of it, please, Hector.
Over here, Hector, I must do a final check.
Gracious, Bridget, what have you got in there?
Six T shirts, three pairs of jeans, four pairs of trousers,
ten bikinis, four sarongs, two skirts, two nightdresses,
three pairs of trainers, two pairs of evening shoes,
three toothbrushes, two toilet bags, five belts, two jackets,
two cans of hair mousse and a ball gown.
But, we're only going for three days.
You never can be sure what event we'll be asked to go to
- parties, balls, the opera, theatre …
… Oh yeah - it won't happen!
When Bridget arrives in Spain, we'll be invited everywhere.
They just won't be able to resist!
What won't they be able to resist?
What are you wearing?
I am a toreador!
Whose is this?!
Bridget's.
You are taking all that?!
Yeah, why?
Oh Bridget, Bridget, Bridget -
all you need to travel is your passport, your tickets and your money, ha-ha!
That will be the taxi!
Let's go!
Come on, boys, give me a hand with my luggage!
Gatwick airport please.
All you need to travel is your passport, your ticket and your money, Nick.
Yeah, yeah, very funny!
Wow, look at this! It's so Spanish!
Yep! Typical Spanish hospitality.
And this is a typical happy Spanish waitress.
Hello! Erm, we are from England.
And we would like a drink, please.
Girls, girls, girls, leave it to me.
I must translate for you.
Hang on.
I'll talk to the lady.
Oh, she doesn't look very happy.
No, she looks a mess!
Perhaps her boyfriend has left her.
Yeah- because she looks a mess!
Maybe he didn't like her hair.
Well actually, he did like my hair and at least mine is natural!
Ah, she understood!
She's English!
How did you guess?!
So, is this a traditional Spanish bar?
This - is a traditional - da - English Tea Room.
In Barcelona?
Ooh, aren't you clever!
Leave it to me.
Please CAN WE - HAVE A DRINK?!!
No!!
Why not?!
There are no tables.
But what about this one? No, no, no...
Erm, or that one?
No. What about this one here?
It's reserved.
Never mind, let's, let's go.
But erm, if you've reserved the table, you can come in.
OK.
Can we please reserve a table?
Certainly …
erm, oh yes, I...I I can just fit you in - that table there.
Right, what would you like to drink?
Cola, please.
Me too. And me.
In Spain, do as the English do.
I will have a nice cup of tea, please.
Which tea?
What have you got? We've got Darjeeling, Kenyan,
English Breakfast, Earl Grey, Lady Grey, Camomile,
Peppermint, Jasmine, Imperial, Oolong, Indian, Green and Yellow - tea.
I'll have a cola please.
Anything to eat?
Erm, yes please. What have you got?
Egg and chips, sausage and chips, fish and chips,
cheese and chips, pie and chips and chicken and …
… Chips!!
… Chicken and croquette potatoes.
So, we can have anything with chips.
Apart from chicken
- or - I have cake. Gatox.
Gatox?
I think she means gateaux.
Gatox please.
Spanish girls are beautiful!
Gre-at! And French girls!
Really?!
I don't believe it.
What? Over there - over there!
Yeah?
It's him!! Who?
Enrique!
Enrique? Qué?
Not Enrique- qué, Enrique Iglesias!
No! Are you sure?
It can't be!! This is Spain. Well he's from Spain!
Well?! I must go and talk to him!
Hair [check] lipstick [check]
top
[check]. Right.
Here I go!
Where's Bridget going?
Enrique Iglesias is sitting over there at that table!
No!!
Enrique!
That is not Enrique Iglesias! No way!
Oh, poor Bridget!
Still, he is quite good looking!
Hah! Latin men are different to English men.
They are not sensitive, gentle, romantic and - sophisticated like me.
Gatox!
I think the waitress fancies you, Nick!
Go on, try one of your chat up lines on her!
Ha! She's not my type!
So what is your type, Nick?
She's coming back! Go on, go on!
Which one, which one, I've forgotten them all!
Use my one, stars, stars.
OK, OK, I remember.
Your teeth are like stars
- they come out at night.
It's obvious - she's crazy about me!
I've got a date with him, I've got a date with him!
Who? Mr Iglesias?
Oh, don't be silly! Of course it's not Enrique Iglesias!
I'm not that stupid!
It's Miguel - and tonight we're going clubbing!
Great! Where are we going?
No, not you, Miguel and me.
Oh no, Bridget, we must be your chaperones!
Yeah, you will not even notice us!
Well, oh all right then!
Oh, all those Spanish girls - clubbing!
Clubbing! Let's boo-oo-gie, baby!
I'll show you how it's done!
This is the story of Bridget and Annie, who share a flat in London,
and the boys next door, Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.
Hector is dating Annie
and Bridget wants to go out with Miguel...
and all Nick wants is a job.
Stand by for Extra.
Nearly ready. There we are!
Perfect!
Now the living room.
Oh, there!
Just there!
Yeah, perfect, baby!
Now, refreshments.
Cola, yes!
Crisps, yes!
And finally...
Dial- A- Pizza. Yes!
Only two hours to go!
Nick!
What is your television doing in my bathroom?
Hi, Bridget.
- So I don't miss anything. - Miss anything?
Yeah, if I have to, you know, when the match is on.
Oh, the match.
So, who's playing today?
It's the semi- finals. England...
Versus...
Argentina!
Hey, Hector, great outfit, but wrong team.
And I've got my lucky World Cup pants on.
Your lucky World Cup pants?
Yep. I don't change them when the World Cup is on.
- But it lasts for weeks. - Yeah.
So, Hector, I've got the refreshments ready.
Cola, crisps...
TV in the bathroom.
- At what time is kickoff? - Midday.
We had better sit down, then.
Hello, everyone. Charley and I are ready for the match.
Annie, you look nice!
- Your ribbons are different. - That's right.
One for England and one for Argentina.
How sweet!
But of course England will win.
I don't think so, Nick.
We beat Jamaica 4- 2.
But we beat Italy 3- 0.
Well, our strikers are the best in the world.
But your defence is poor.
- No, it's not. - Yes, it is.
It's not! It's not! It's not!
It is! It is! It is!
Break!
And now make friends.
You're so childish.
Miguel arrives today. At least he's a real man.
But he loves football too.
A Spanish supporter.
- Hello? - We'll beat them, in the final.
Nick, for you. Your agent.
Goody!
Hi, Cameron. How are you?
Good. An audition?
For me?
What for?
London On Fire?
The soap? Yes!
When?
Today? At midday?
Where?
Birmingham?
But that's 100 miles away.
No, of course I'm pleased.
OK, thank you.
Bye.
An audition for London On Fire? That's brilliant.
Yeah, you must be pleased, man.
Yes, I am.
I am very, very pleased.
I am so happy.
I can see that.
Why today?
Why this afternoon?
Why in Birmingham?
What about the football?
It's only a football game.
Bridget,
there are some people who think that football is a matter of life and death.
It isn't.
It is much more important than that.
- Don't go to the audition, then. - Don't go?
Don't go? I must go.
Drama is my life.
Look, Nick, we can record it for you.
Yeah, and we won't tell you the score.
Really? You won't tell me the score? You promise?
- Promise. - Promise.
OK, promise.
OK.
I will go,
and perform for England.
But of course England will win.
Yes!
I am so happy.
I don't believe it.
It's a very, very bad hair day.
And Miguel is arriving this evening.
It's a disaster.
It's a catastrophe.
I said it's a catastrophe.
What is a catastrophe?
Bridget's hair.
I've got to do something.
I know. Carol.
She'll help me.
..we've got all the action coming up.
Hello? Carol?
Bridget here.
Look, this is an emergency.
I need a hair appointment.
I need a style that a Spanish football fan will adore.
You can? Goody.
I'll see you at five o'clock.
Sorted!
..this semifinal between the two giants...
Come on, England!
Come on, Argentina!
..but a strong team.
England look like... Are they going to score? Yes! It looks like it!
Now Argentina, coming up on the outside. They're looking dangerous.
They've got through the defence and they score.
Come on, England. They've got to pull themselves together. And who's this?
Look at him. He's broken through. And it's a goal!
A minute to go in this exciting match and England have possession.
Yes! Yes! Yes! It's gone in!
What a game!
Yeah, it was fantastic.
Poor Hector.
- Argentina did very well against England. - Yeah.
But not well enough.
We must not look too happy.
We promised Nick not to tell him the score.
And, Hector,
you must not look too sad.
Come on, try to smile. Come on, snuggly puppykins.
Like this.
It'll do.
Hi, Nick.
- Hello. - Hi, Nick.
- Good match? - You know, so- so.
Yeah.
- Where's the tape? - Hector's got it.
- Where's Hector? - In your apartment.
- Bye, then. - Bye.
Yes!
Hi, Hector.
Nick, my friend, you are back.
Is this is the football match?
Yep.
- What? - You won, didn't you?
- Won what? - The football.
Argentina beat England, didn't they?
Nick, I promised you I wouldn't say anything.
But I know. You're so happy.
No, I'm not.
I knew it. I knew it.
Poor England, my country.
Nick, you can watch the match on video.
I can't bear it.
How, Hector, how could you?
How could Argentina beat England?
Nick,
just watch the tape.
I can't wait to see Miguel.
I'm going to the hairdresser's to get my hair done for gorgeous Miguel. Bye.
Hello.
OK, repeat after me.
Bridget, you are so beautiful.
Bridget, you are so beautiful.
Bridget, I love your hair.
Bridget, I love your hair.
And your smile.
And your smile.
No problem, Miguel. See you later.
Hector and Bridget!
How could they?
Argentina did very well against England.
Yeah.
But not well enough.
This is an emergency. I need a hair appointment.
I need a style that a Spanish football fan will adore.
Bridget, you are so beautiful.
Annie.
- Annie? - Yes, Hector?
- Are you all right? - Yes.
Are you cross about something?
Why do you think that?
Annie, come and sit down.
Yes!
Annie, have I done something wrong?
Yes!
Goal!
Well, if you don't tell me, I won't know.
You know, Hector. You know.
Yes! Yes! Yes! We won!
We won!
We're in the final!
Sorry, have I missed something?
Bridget?
Bridget, what's wrong?
Why have you got a bag on your head?
- Come on, let's take it off. - Leave it!
Is it your hair?
It can't be that bad.
It is!
Come on.
Do you promise not to laugh?
We promise.
Don't we?
All right, then, here goes.
It's very...
nice.
I knew it!
I knew you'd laugh!
It's a disaster and Miguel will be here any moment.
That's him!
He mustn't see me like this.
Miguel?
Come in.
I'll just tell Bridget.
Bridget. Miguel's here.
I don't want to see him. I can't.
Trust me, Bridget, he will love your hair.
Miguel!
Bridget, you are so beautiful.
I love your hair, and your smile.
I love your hair.
So, Spain versus England in the World Cup final.
Poor old England.
On the contrary, my Spanish friend.
Prepare to die.
Nick, please ask Hector to pass the crisps.
Hector, Annie says can you pass the crisps?
Please ask Annie why hasn't she spoken to me for two days.
Annie, Hector says why haven't you spoken to him for two days?
Tell him...
She says...
It's starting.
..final between England and their arch- rivals Spain.
Come on, England. Come on.
Come on, Spain.
He passes to Scholes, and yes...
- Go on! - And here's Spain...and it's a goal!
- Yes! - Goal!
England have the ball. They are heading for goal.
Yes!
Annie, can I ask you something?
Yes, Hector?
Have you ever thought about getting married?
Who to?
To someone...
Someone like...me.
..and he shoots and he scores!
I don't believe it!
What a match!
Spain played really well.
Yeah, but not well enough.
Poor Miguel. Speak to me in English again.
Bridget, you are so beautiful.
I love your hair and your smile.
- Is that all he knows? - Yep, and I taught him.
- When? - On the phone.
You were on the phone to Miguel!
- Teaching him English. - Silly me!
I thought you were talking to Bridget.
Annie, there is only one person for me.
Me?
Well? Will you?
Will she what?
Marry me?
Yes, Hector!
Next time in Extra...
Hector and Annie plan their wedding.
Nick is in for a surprise.
And guess who's coming from Argentina.
And guess who's coming from Argentina.
Oh, Hector, it's perfect!
Yeah, perfect!
Oh - Hector, you have mail!
Ah, and they're all from your mother.
Shall I? Yes please, do.
What do they say?
Cuántas damas de honor va a llevar Annie? Diez o doce? Well, she says,
"How many bridesmaids is Annie having? Ten or twelve?"
Ten or twelve?!
You will like this one Annie.
"Have you booked Westminster Abbey yet?
I'm coming to London soon, to help you."
Oh, Hector! Your mother is very kind but we want a small wedding.
She must not interfere!
Oh, Annie.
Hector, we want our pet wedding, don't we?
… Erm, yes. Well she must not interfere any more!
It's OK. I won't let her - come here.
Hmm, you look happy!
Man trouble?
How is - erm, ah, Miguel?
Miguel is finished!
It's all football, football, football with Miguel.
Oh! What do you expect from Spanish men?!
So I said, "Bye, bye, Miguel."
Oh and Annie and Hector are so happy.
It's weddings, weddings, weddings …
I'll never find a decent man. I'll just be single for ever!
Oh rubbish!
What you need is a new man in your life!
But where can I get one?
Oh hi - Bridget here - can I have a new man please?
Oh - and what about - that gorgeous - Nick!
Nick?!
Oh, he's great as 'Pierce Steele' in London on Fire -
oh, what a hunk!!
But he's …
Come on Bridget, you said you want a new man -
- well let me introduce you to the new Nick!
I want you to interview him for Stars at 9 on 9!
Interview Nick?
But all he talks about is girls - oh and motorbikes.
Forget what he says -
ask him - to take his jacket off!!
Hmm-hmm, here,
look at this - London on Fire!
Enjoy it! Ahm!!
Oh Pierce, how can I ever thank you?
It was nothing!
It's all - in a day's work for -
Pierce Steele.
Hi Bridget … Oh, hi Nick.
Come and sit down.
OK.
What are you reading?
Oh, a magazine about weddings.
I love weddings, don't you?
The problem is I'm always the bridesmaid, never the bride!
Isn't it lovely!
Yeah! The Ferrari Testarosa.
What a great car! I meant her dress!
Do you like it, Nick?
Well, it wouldn't suit me! Ha-ha!
Nick - you're so funny!
I love funny men.
I need a drink! Would you like one?
And good looking ones.
I'd love to marry a funny, good looking man.
By the way, Nick, I saw London on Fire
- you're very good in it.
Really? Did you think so?
In fact, I wondered if …
… Yeah …? … If you want to …
… Yeah … Will you … ?
… Yeah! Will you do an interview with me for Channel 9?
Oh - yeah.

Courtesy of Mrs Romero - Wedding Dresses.
Courtesy of Mrs Romero - Honeymoons.
Hector's mother is driving me mad!!
Maybe I should just cancel the wedding.
Really? Well I wouldn't!
I suppose marriage will mean sacrifices.
No more shaving your legs on the toilet. No more soaps on TV.
Oh no!! No more midnight chocolate feasts!
But then you will be Mrs Romero!
Do you think Bridget is ill?
No why?
She's being very nice to me - very nice.
Well maybe she is ill.
She's talking about weddings, you and Annie.
You don't think she wants to get married too, do you?
Ha! Who to?
Well - you said she was being very nice to you.
No! You don't think?!
Annie
- I have something to tell you.
What? Nick.
Nick, what?
I fancy Nick.
She did mean me!
Oh Hector - help!
Once you're married - they've got you!
You fancy Nick? Yes I do, I do!
But you don't like Nick. I do like Nick.
No you don't, you think he's an idiot!
Yes, but he's so macho!
You think he's vain!
But he's so good looking!
Huh! You don't like his clothes!
But now he wears a fireman's uniform.
Ah, so that's it! The uniform.
He's so sexy in London on Fire.
So, what are you going to do?
Tomorrow I will interview him for Channel 9 …
… And then?
You'll just have to wait and see.
There's one good thing about getting married.
Yeah, love.
No - no! The Stag Night!
The what? The Stag Night.
It's when the bridegroom - that's you, is taken out by his best man, that's me
to say - goodbye.
Goodbye? Yep. Goodbye to your fantastic life as a single man.
Goodbye to drinking beer and watching football in bed.
Goodbye to eating curry for breakfast.
And worst of all
goodbye... ...to Kylie Minogue!!
Don't worry Hector - we will face this together!
Oh thank you Nick - you are a real friend!
Anyway
- this stag night!
What are we going to do?
Go to the cinema? Wha … ?!
In England - we do crazy things!
We party, we go to Brighton, we dress up …
… As what? Women!
So, I am here with Nick Jessop
- or Pierce Steele, straight from the set of London on Fire.
- Nick... Good evening.
Do you think London on Fire accurately reflects the pressures on London's emergency services?
Dunno! But the women are good looking!
Erm, do you get very hot?
In the flames, when you're filming.
No, not really.
Do you take your jacket off sometimes?
Yeah, sometimes.
When it gets very … hot? Yeah.
Erm, eh, no, not really.
Erm, and what about the women? The women?
The women you rescue.
You carry them out of the house that is on fire.
Oh yeah. They must love it!
Well they are acting.
And do they ask you to …? Do they ask me to what?
Take your jacket off. Oh, erm, no.
Will you take it off now?
Er - OK.
Could you carry me?! When?!
Now! Carry me like you do on London on Fire!
Er - OK.
Oh … you're so strong!
This is Bridget Evans with Nick Jessop for Channel 9.
Shall I put you down now? Oh, do you have to?!!
Oh, hi Hector.
Hi Annie.
Em, Hector/Annie …
Oh, no, you go first. Oh, no, you first.
OK. Annie, this wedding …
I was going to say "this wedding …"
Oh, OK, you say it then.
Oh - no - you. OK, let's write it down.
Good idea.
Ready?
One, two, three, show!
Oh, yes Hector, let's wait!
This wedding is a nightmare! Yeah!
Let's celebrate not getting married! Yeah!
OK, erm, I'm going shopping now, but meet me at Leo's Café at 5pm.
I'll be there!
You must tell your mother!
Thank goodness she's thousands of miles away in Argentina!
Make sure you tell her before she leaves.
Oh no!!
Meet me at Leo's café at 5pm.
Annie - or Mum?
Mum - or Annie?
Oh hi Nick, did you have a good day?
Gre-at! I saved London again.
Oh, and I was interviewed by Bridget.
Man, I thought she was going to ask me to marry her! Ha-ha!
Gre-at.
OK, what's up?
My mother is coming to London.
Ooh! Does Annie know? No.
Ooops!
But we have cancelled the wedding.
Wow! Does your mother know? No.
Whoops!
It gets worse.
I was supposed to meet both of them this afternoon in different places!
Ha-ha-ha - triple oops!
Oh Hector, don't worry.
Women always forget.
Hi Annie.
Hector, where are you? Annie, listen!
I'm glad we're not getting married!
Ha-hmm. So they didn't forget!
Annie please,
listen to me! What, or who is more important than me?
Tut-tut-tut. First marriage row! We are not getting married!
Pardon me!
Annie, today was difficult, impossible.
I don't want to know!
Annie - it's my mother! What about your mother?!
Heeere's mother!!
Hector darling! Mw-mw.
Oh, speak to me in English. I've taken lessons!
Where is Annie, where's my little bride?
What a beauty! Hector! You've kept her beauty a secret!
No, Mamá - this is Bridget.
This is Annie.
Donatella can help you.
Annie is the prettiest, sweetiest, kindest girl in the world.
Didn't you tell her the wedding is off?
I didn't get the chance. Well now's the time.
Mum. Yes.
Annie and I have decided to …
… Wait a few years before we get married.
No wedding! Oh no!!
Oh, thank you Bridget.
Do you have a boyfriend?
I hope so, Mrs Romero.
Oh - is he handsome?
Yes, he's very handsome - and muscular!
I love macho men.
What's his name?
Nick - Nick Jessop!
Nick?! Hector's best man!
Yes, that's him.
Time to party!
Mama - meet Nick
So, have you booked Westminster Abbey yet?!
Next time in EXTRA
- Bridget tries to change Nick.
Hector's mother comes to dinner,
but why does Annie behave badly?
This is the story ofBridget andAnnie, who share a flat in London,
and the boys next door, Nick and his friend Hector, from Argentina.
Annie and Hector have decided not to get married.
Bridget and Nick are dating, but Nick is getting bored,
so will it last?
Find out in Extra.
Oh, Bridget...
this is wonderful.
I'm so glad you like it, Nick.
I just can't get enough. I want more, more, more!
Nick, honey, there's plenty more where that came from.
- Nick? - Yes, Bridget darling?
- How long have we been together now? - Erm...
We've been together two days, Nick.
Wow! That long? Hmm!
Yes, it is a long time, Nick.
But if...we are to...
continue our relationship,
you must...
Will you...?
Will you treat me like a lady?
Bridget darling, just call me Gentleman Nick.
Nick! Nick!
You must... There must be more...
Snogging!
There must be more respect.
Oh, Nick.
Let's see what sort of gentleman you are.
Here's a little test. Follow me.
- Well? - Well, what?
I want to go out.
- Oh. - So...
- What do you do? - Oh!
- Kiss you goodbye! - No.
You open the door for me.
Huh? Ah!
Because I am the strongest!
Rahr! Rahr! Tarzan!
Oh, come on, Ziggy, we'll be late.
Is just you and Ziggy doing this protest?
Yes, but when other people see how important it is, they'll join us. We must stop...
Oh, excuse me, Annie.
- Problems? - What? Oh, no, no, no.
- No problems at all. - Oh, look! There's Ziggy. Must dash.
- Have fun! - This is not fun. This is serious.
This is serious too.
Now, clothes.
What?
I want you more...like David Beckham.
Ah, like this!
Now, where is it?
Aha! Here it is.
Now, come here.
- Really, Bridget, I don't think... - Oh, don't be silly, Nick.
There! That's better.
Now, we must go deeper.
There is a bigger problem.
You have a lot of anger in there.
Well, yes, I am wearing this stupid hair band.
So, we must work on your inner calm.
I want to see your chest.
OK!
Lie down.
Close your eyes...
and relax.
Ahhh!
Now, this may tickle a bit.
- Ready? - Yeah.
Here goes!
Just feel that anger go!
Acupuncture never fails.
- Oh, hi, Mrs Romero. - Hello, Bridget. Where is Hector?
Hello, Mrs Romero.
Do you remember Nick, Mrs Romero?
Time to party!
I can't forget him.
Oh! Hola, Mama!
Sorry I'm late.
- Coffee? - Oh, yes, please.
Excuse us, Mrs Romero.
Come on, Nick, I'm taking you shopping.
- Uh- uh. - Oh? So you want some more acupuncture?
OK, OK, I'm coming, I'm coming.
And don't forget your money.
Rahr! Rahr!
Oh, you are learning quickly.
I want you more like David Beckham.
Ah, like this?
Wow! That long? Hmm!
Oh! You are learning quickly!
Oh, oh, oh, oh! Mother, when in London, we speak English.
Yes, we must. English is the language of high class, so I must teach it...
Learn.
- You must learn it, not teach it. - Oh, yes.
So your father has found you a wife.
He told me. He must stop shopping on eBay.
Look, Mum, I don't want a wife.
I've got Annie.
This girl is from a good family.
- So is Annie. - This girl is rich.
I don't care about money.
But she's almost royalty.
Mum, Annie is my princess.
But she's so...
She's so clever, so kind, so happy!
- Annie? - Very happy!
What happened?
Ziggy and I were in a field lying down.
Sunbathing?
- Protesting. - And...?
It began to rain!
Oh, poor Annie.
Don't touch her!
Now, listen, Mum, I've told you I love Annie.
Be careful, your pullover.
Hector, your mother's right.
Don't touch me!
Why did you do that?
Because I love you, darling.
If you knew Annie, you would love her.
Well, I'm going home tomorrow.
Look, Mum, come to dinner tonight and you will meet the real Annie.
And if you don't like her, then...
then I might marry the princess Dad has found.
Annie?
- Annie. - Yes, Hector?
- Can we talk? - If that's OK with your mother.
Oh, Annie, she's gone to her hotel now.
Look, she's going home tomorrow
and I thought we would invite her to dinner tonight.
Well, I'm going out.
Annie, please don't be silly. Stay and be nice to her.
She is OK, really.
Well, OK then.
But you must do one thing for me.
Sure. What?
- Scrub my back. - Oh, but I am still dressed.
So am I. Well, I can't put these in the washing machine. They're filthy.
Apricot?
No. Annie, will you behave?
- When? - When my mother comes to dinner.
Probably.
Strawberry.
Annie, I have an idea.
Nick is pretending to be someone different.
Nick isn't pretending. This is the new Nick. Isn't it, Nick?
You can pretend as well.
You can pretend to be what my mother wants.
What, Princess Caroline of Monaco?
Look, Nick is pretending to be what Bridget wants.
Yeah, a slave.
How can I help? As you can see, I'm a talented stylist.
Could I have some more cola, please, sweetie?
My mother is coming to dinner tonight.
Oh! So what's on the menu?
I am!
What sort of food does your mother like?
Babies on toast?
I don't know. A traditional English dish.
I am not going to pretend to eat meat.
How about roast Annie?
I know. What about sweet and sour prawn balls?
- Sweet for me... - And sour for Hector's mum!
Nick, behave.
Very funny.
I will cook dinner.
And Nick will look after your mother because he's such a gentleman now.
Don't you worry about Mrs R. She'll have a great time.
Leave it to me.
So, Annie, will you pretend?
OK, Hector.
For you, tonight, I will pretend to be the perfect girlfriend.
Annie,
you and I are going shopping.
Too obvious.
Too Margaret Thatcher.
Hector will love it, but, no.
Perfect!
Don't touch her!
Your mother's right. Don't touch me!
- No! - You can pretend to be what my mother wants.
What? Princess Caroline of Monaco?
Perfect!
Yeah, a slave.
Wow! Annie!
You look great.
I look 45 years old.
But my mother will like it.
Snap!
Versace?
Marks and Spencer's.
Have you enjoyed your visit to London, Mrs Romero?
I love London.
We often visit our friends, Liz and Phil.
And where do they live?
Buckingham Palace.
There you are, Mrs Romero.
Oh, you are so handsome, Nick.
Annie has had an interesting day today, haven't you, Annie?
Go on, Annie, tell Mother about your interesting day.
OK. Well, our GM protest went very well today.
What's GM?
I don't know.
Great Men?
A Great Men protest?
- Really? - It means genetically modified.
Listen, Mum.
So, so the farmer came over to see what we were doing...
Oh, GM, GM! Gorgeous Men!
Ooh!
- Another drink, Mrs R? - Oh, yes, Nick, please.
You have lovely eyes.
Anyway, he told us to go away, and when we wouldn't...
There you are, madam.
- Where did you learn your beautiful manners? - Oh, I was born with them.
Sit down.
And then the police arrested us,
but I escaped prison so I could be here tonight.
It is a joke!
Come on, Mum, talk to Annie.
So, Annie, Hector tells me you like animals.
Oh, I love them, but I don't eat them.
I'm a vegetarian.
How odd.
If we cannot eat animals,
why are they made of meat, then?
You are so funny, Nick.
But I do love horses.
Oh, yes, they're wonderful.
And I love riding.
I love your English hunt.
Yes, the dogs, the handsome men in red coats.
- The dead fox. - Yes, the dead fox.
No! It's cruel.
The poor fox.
What do you know? You are not from a good family.
There's nothing wrong with my family.
You are not family of beauty.
Well, anyway, I don't believe that Hector is your son.
He's too good- looking!
Right, that's it.
I'm going.
Mum, Annie didn't mean... Annie, Mum didn't mean...
Yes, we did!
And another thing. You won't need hounds on a hunt.
When the fox sees you coming, he'll run!
Hector, I shall see you in Argentina for your wedding...
to our perfect princess.
Well, that went rather well, didn't it!
Oh, who is this?
He's darling!
- Oh, that's Charley. Charley belongs to A... - Me!
- He's my baby. - Isn't he gorgeous?
Look, darling, here's Mummy.
Women!
So, Hector, who's this Latin American princess?
Well, my father wants me to marry her,
but I will not, of course.
Well, if you don't want her, I'll have her.
More wine, Nick!
Next time in Extra:
Nick gets ajob as a bouncer.
If your name's not on the guest list, then you cannot come in!
Annie gets a tattoo,
and Hector wants to be a tough guy.
Extra, don't miss it.
Extra, don'tmissit.
This is the story ofBridget andAnnie,
who share a flat in London.
And the boys next door, Nick,
and his friend Hector, from Argentina.
Annie and Hector are in love.
Bridget and Nick are still dating, just.
But Nick is desperate for a job. Anyjob.
Stand by for Extra.
Hector, stop being such a baby.
But it hurts!
I haven't touched you yet.
Now stay still. You will just feel a little needle prick.
Go on then. Hurt me, do it!
Hector!
Hector! I've done it.
I've removed the splinter.
Yes, I knew that. I was joking.
What is it? Are you scared of needles?
Who, me?
Don't be silly.
But it was a very painful splinter.
OK, so if you're not scared of needles, would you have a tattoo?
A tattoo?
Yes. Yes, I would.
Go on, then, tough guy.
OK, I'll have one if you have one.
OK.
OK, it's a deal.
By the way, Hector...
I had this done this morning.
But then, a deal is a deal, isn't it?
I want a word with you.
Tough guy, eh?
Yeah? What do you want?
I don't...
I don't...
I keep forgetting this bit!
I don't like your face.
OK, so is this for television or theatre?
Nope. This is real. This is me.
And you are...
Can't you guess?
Guys, you are looking at Muscles.
- Where? - No, no, no. It's my new name.
I am the new man on the door at Ice.
What, you're a bouncer?
What is a bouncer?
It's someone who throws people out of nightclubs.
I am an entry executive.
- So you throw people out of the club? - Yeah.
Yeah. Nick, my granny could beat you up.
But if your granny came to Ice and caused trouble,
I would have to ask her to leave.
Besides, I'd have Knuckles, Cruncher and Muncher to back me up.
Who?
- The other bouncers. - Yeah, right.
- Hi, sweetie. - Has someone died?
No, not yet.
Why are you dressed in black then?
Because, baby,
you are looking at the new man on the door at Ice.
You are on the door at Ice?
But that's... But that's wonderful news!
What shall I wear?
I'll call the girls to find out what they're wearing.
The thing is, Bridget,
if your name's not on the guest list, then you can't come in.
Nick, if my name's not on the guest list,
then you can't come home.
Hello?
Hi!
Yep, that's right.
I start on Friday? OK, baby!
No probs. Leave it with me.
Ciao!
My mum. She wants me to do some...gardening for her.
I am the new man on the door at Ice!
I don't like your face.
If your name's not on the guest list,
then you can't come in.
Hector, I just won...
What are you doing?
Just looking for a number.
I see.
Well, I just wondered if you wanted to share my chocolate with me
- before Bridget sees it. - Yeah! Great! Thanks.
Annie?
Did I tell you about the time three people tried to fight me?
- All at once? - Yep.
Really? Well, go on.
Well, three of them, they came at me.
Oh, you poor thing! And what did they want?
My sweets.
- And how old were you? - Six.
And they were...?
Five, three and two.
Hector! Two years old! They were babies!
Yeah, but the Sanchez sisters were really tough!
Hector, you are sweet.
Do you think I should be more macho?
Hector, you don't have to be a tough guy for me.
I love you just the way you are.
Annie.
Come on, let's eat this chocolate before Bridget finds it.
Please, let me.
You're so strong!
- What is it? - You are standing on my foot.
Wimp.
- Hi, Nick. - Hi.
Hey, listen to this.
Bouncer of the month is Alex Smith,
who last year stopped 955 people
from going into his club.
- What is the name of the club? - It doesn't say.
It shut down last week. Not enough people were going there.
Nick?
What is a wimp?
Well, it's not...
Annie just called me a wimp.
I want to be a tough guy, like you.
Can you teach me, please?
Of course, I was born like this,
but I can try to help you, Hector, I can try.
Great!
Why don't you show me how to be a bouncer.
Att...i...tude.
Att...i...tude?
Yeah. Like this.
Are you looking at me?
Are you looking at me?
Are you looking at me?
Are you looking at me?
Hey, great!
So who am I looking at when I say that?
Anyone who is looking for trouble.
And how do I know they are looking for trouble?
You just know.
Look.
What is this?
Bridget's old toys.
What are they doing under your bed, then?
I was looking after them for her.
Yeah, anyway, look.
Here, this is the club.
You cannot come in!
Let me in!
Are you looking at me or chewing a brick, eh?
Cos either way, you'll lose your teeth.
You know, brick, teeth, chew.
Very good!
You are a very scary guy.
Look! It's handsome Nick!
Look at his muscles.
Hello! You are looking lovely tonight.
Leave my boyfriend alone!
It's OK, Bridget. I'm just doing my job.
If your name's not on the guest list,
then you cannot come in.
If your name's not on the guest list,
then you cannot come in.
Please could I have your name, sir?
What do you want that for?
Because if your name's not on the g...
guest list, you cannot come in.
And what are you going to do about it, pip...squeak?
I...
I'm...
I...
So be a good boy!
Didn't you hear what the man said?
He said, 'Go. Disappear. Vanish. Evaporate. Now!'
OK, I'm going!
Sorry you had to see that, Bridget.
Course, I had the situation completely under control.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, Bridget, why are you here?
What?
- I've brought you some sandwiches. - Bridget, how nice of you.
- Where are they? - Where are what?
The sandwiches.
I must have left them behind. Never mind!
So, who's here tonight?
I'm afraid I can't tell you. It's confidential.
OK.
Well, there's the usual crowd.
Heidi, Kate, Naomi.
Sorry, Bridget. I have work to do.
Good evening, ladies!
Could I have your names, please?
Thank you. Just one more thing. Bridget!
Arms up, please, ladies.
Let me see. Very nice.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, ladies.
Have a great evening.
All part of the job.
OK, Nick. So when is it my turn?
I want to go in!
Bridget, Bridget, Bridget. I promise.
As soon as I can arrange it, I will.
Look, there's a big Latino night next week.
- J- Lo will be coming. - J- Lo?
Leave it to me.
Thank you, Nick!
Stand back. I need to take control.
Good!
Everything is under control.
Wimp!
Good evening, ladies!
I have the situation completely under control.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- J- Lo will be coming. - J- Lo?
Annie?
About the tattoo.
Look.
You did it!
And Hector, what a wonderful tattoo!
I don't know what to say!
It was nothing.
And I mean it.
Hector and Annie forever.
And look! Charley likes the tattoo as well.
Charley!
Hector!
Please. I've just eaten!
Bridget, look.
Hector has had a tattoo done just for me!
Isn't it romantic?
Hec- ni- ver.
Hec- ni- ver? It doesn't sound very romantic. What does it mean?
What's happened?
It's coming off!
Charley has licked it off.
It's a fake!
Hector, you wimp!
- Hector. - Hi, Nick.
- What's the joke? - I am.
Listen.
J- Lo is coming to Ice tonight,
so we need extra bouncers.
So you will be working with me on the door!
But I...
And tell Bridget and Annie they are on the guest list.
- OK, tough guy? - OK.
Yeah.
Good evening, ladies!
You are looking lovely tonight.
Hector, you look so handsome.
I'm sorry I laughed at your tattoo.
Annie, Annie, Annie, I am on duty.
Is J- Lo here yet?
She's here.
Goodie! I love mixing with the stars.
- Hi. - Hello.
She's cute.
Hi, gorgeous.
- What did he say? - Nothing.
Was he...?
- What are you looking at? - I am looking at you looking at her.
I can look at her.
Not when I am looking at her looking at you.
I think you mean, 'Not when I'm looking at you looking at her.'
That is what I said!
You know what? I tell you I'm gonna buy her a drink, OK?
What did he say?
I think he said he's gonna buy her a drink.
Hector, no!
Right, that is it! I am going in!
No, Hector, don't! Leave it!
Oi, you! Leave my girl alone!
Nick! Nick! His mate is chatting up Bridget.
Right, that's it! I'm going in!
Oi, you! Leave my girl alone!
Muscles, you're fired! And so is your friend!
That was great!
I didn't even see J- Lo.
See, Hector? I knew you weren't a wimp.

Nice.
Sorry, Annie. Exams. I forgot!
I won't make a sound.
Sorry, Annie. I...

Do not eat that apple.
Sorry. You want it, Annie?
No, Hector! It's too noisy!
I am trying to revise!
My exams are next week!
I need some classical music.
Sorry, Annie, I...
Help!
Annie!
Help!
Help!
Annie?
Annie!
Why is Hector hanging out of the window?
Poor Hector!
- Hector, are you OK? - Yeah.
The window is dirty.
Well, then, it's a job for a window cleaner, not you!
Hey, guys, look at these!
It's pictures of my makeover!
What is a makeover?
It's when they use make- up to turn this...
into this!
Just joking!
Bridget, they're fantastic!
You look like a film star!
Cameron Diaz, watch out!
Were you wearing lots of makeup?
No.
Anyway, what are they for?
Well, Nick wants to be a Hollywood movie star
and if he can do it, I can do it!
Really?
You are going to tell George Ducas about me?
What, the George Ducas, the Hollywood director?
You're going to tell him what a great actor I am?
Oh, Victoria!
Thank you so much!
How can I thank you?
Can't anyone else do it?
Yes! Of course I want you to tell George about me!
No problem.
See you later.
Ciao.
That was my friend, Victoria Yallop, the really good actress.
Yeah, she's a really good actress.
Nick, darling!
Well, guess what?
She's going to tell George Ducas, the Hollywood director, all about you.
- Yeah! How did you know? - Lucky guess.
And what do you have to do for her?
Nothing.
She wants me to look after something for her.
Victoria Yallop. Nick is expecting me.
Nick, darling!
This must be so much trouble for you!
No problem. No problem at all.
Sweet! OK, three rules.
No meat, clean underpants in the morning and in bed by eight.
Now meet...
Where are you?
Come here!
Nick, meet Lucas.
Lucas, say hello to Uncle Nicky- Wicky!
Hi.
Good joke!
Well, I must dash.
George is waiting for me.
Don't worry, Nick, I'm going to tell him all about you!
Lucas, be a good boy for Uncle Nicky- Wicky!
Don't tell me.
Nightmare On Elm Street.
Goodbye, darlings! Goodbye!
I'm hungry.
Nick?
What is going on?
Victoria's au pair has run off with the postman.
So?
So, she's got no one to look after Lucas.
So, why can't she look after her own son?
Because she's going to meet George Ducas.
- Where? - New York.
- New York? - She'll be back tomorrow!
Tomorrow?
He's very sweet but what about my exams?
He won't be a problem. You won't even notice him.
We'd better not.
Hector! Stop.
Say hello to Uncle Nicky- Wicky!
Annie, have you seen these?
You showed me earlier.
No.
Look.
It's that...that child!
What's that noise?
Lucas is playing ball.
Oh, is he?
You've made me do that.
He's on my bike!
I know. Just don't go in the bathroom.
I said don't go in the bathroom.
And I don't know what he's done with the toilet paper.
Poor Charley.
I'm hungry.
Nick, where have you been?
Shopping for Lucas.
Nick, you must take control of him.
Baby, I'm trying!
Nick, I'm trying to work.
I'm trying to revise for my exams.
OK, OK. Very nice, Lucas.
Maybe later?
I know. Let's play games.
- I've got Twister. - Great.
Oh, OK, boys versus girls.
So, I'll just move my left foot over to you.
It is stuck!
OK, I'll move my hand.
Hey, I can't move!
Nor can I!
What's happening?
Lucas? What have you done?
Lucas, come here!
Lucas! Come on!
Lucas!
Please.
I'm going to tell him all about you!
I'm hungry.
I'm hungry.
Hi, Lucas! Where have you been?
To the zoo.
- Where's Nick? - He had to take the penguin back.
- The penguin? - Yeah. It must have fallen into my bag.
What are you listening to?
I said, what are you listening to?
Dog Puppy Dog.
Can I listen?
This is good!
Sorry!
Hector!
Lucas! Come here!
Lucas, why are you so...
Hey, that's me!
Lucas, do you want to be like me? A news reporter?
Well, to be a good news reporter
you have to do everything exactly as I do.
All good newsreaders brush their teeth.
Check.
Comb their hair.
Check.
- And say good night. - I'm hungry.
Check. Good night.
Goodnight, sugar plum.
Haven't you got a girlfriend, Lucas?
Girls are wonderful, especially Bridget.
Girls are yuck, especially Bridget.
Yeah, well, anyway, time for bed.
Nick, thank you for a lovely day.
Well, that's OK, little fellow.
We'll have more fun tomorrow. Night night.
Sweet kid!
How does he do that?
I've had enough of you, you little...
Now, sweetie, that was very good!
But Auntie Bridget thinks you should stretch more like this!
Would you like a cup of tea?
Hi, Nick!
This is Joe. He was just telling me about window cleaning.
So I see!
So, you want my girlfriend, do you?
Thanks, Lucas!
Nick, Joe, stop!
No! He started it!
Nick, what are you doing?
Electric shocks!
Check!
How do you do that?
Poor Joe!
I haven't paid him! Joe!
Has Bridget just run off with the window cleaner?
Yep!
Cuckoo! Anybody home?
Lucas, my darling, I'm back! Give your mummy a hug!
- How was George? - Wonderful!
So, did you tell George about, you know?
You know?
What?
Did you tell George Ducas about me?
What a good actor I am.
I'm so sorry, darling.
I completely forgot!
It was all so exciting!
Lucas, you're going to have a new daddy!
George and I are going to be married.
I'm going to be Mrs George Ducas.
Hey! That means you are going to be Lucas Ducas!
Lucas, come with me and meet your new daddy.
See? Girls are yuck!
Next time in Extra...
Bridget gets a new computer,
the boys get competitive,
and Annie gets a surprise.
and Annie gets a surprise.
This is the story of Bridget and Annie, who share a flat in London,
and the boys next door, Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.
Annie and Hector are dating
and Bridget and Nick were dating, but that's history.
Now all Nick wants is a job, a babe or a motorbike.
He's not fussy.
Stand by for Extra.
Oh, darling, no. I'll die without you.
He's Robert. He ran away with Jenny.
Oh, no!
That's why she can't marry Lionel.
- That is so sad. - I know.
But doesn't Jenny know that Lionel is her brother?
She had a car accident.
She can't remember.
That is terrible!
Quick, quick, quick, quick!
Go on! Kick it! Kick it!
Football! Hi, boys.
- Hi, Bridget. - Hi, Bridget.
- I need your help. - Sure. What is it?
I'm going to buy a new computer for work.
I know everything about computers.
Great!
I need one with a lot of gigabytes, good RAM memory,
all the software compatibility and the top processor.
Maybe this one?
No, this one hasn't got what she wants.
And you understand what she wants?
Yeah. You don't?
- Of course I do. - Well, so do I.
So? Have you decided which one?
Who's going to pay for it?
It's for work, so they'll pay for it.
- This one, then. - This one is the most expensive.
It's a nice colour.
Well...
It has everything you want.
Do you think more SDI sockets, or the analogue input?
Forget it. I'll order it now.
Come on, come on!
What are you doing out here?
Waiting for my examination results.
Your results are arriving today?
What have you done to Teddy?
Brad Pitt is much more handsome than Teddy.
Where is it?
Bill, bill, nothing, nothing, bill...
It's not my examination results.
It's from the landlady.
It says we are too noisy.
Noisy? She's written to the wrong apartment.
We're never noisy.
My new computer's here!
Well, Nick? Open it.
- Why me? - Nails.
Anything else?
Well, it's a very big box.
What's that?
I think it's the instructions.
Great. Have fun.
Wait! Where are you going?
Shopping.
You'd better have finished when I get back.
Better have finished what?
Installing the computer.
You do know everything about computers, don't you?
No problem.
The instructions are all in English.
Look... Hector, here's a Spanish version.
Yes...
Right, let's do it.
Or don't you know how to do it?
I could do it with my eyes closed!
Well, instructions are for girls!
Oh, yeah!
I am the man!
Yeah, but I did all the work.
You? I did it.
I am the computer king.
- Yeah? - Yeah.
- You think you can beat me? - I already did.
Computers are easy.
How about a real challenge?
Whatever challenge you like.
Right...
Man Olympics. Challenge One.
Who can put the most marshmallows in his mouth?
- Marsh... - ..mallows.
- Look. One. - One.
- Two. - Two.
- Three. - Three.
- Four. - Four.
I'm going to buy a new computer for work.
No, this one hasn't got what she wants.
And you understand what she wants?
Come on, come on!
Where is it?
How about a real challenge?
- One. - One.
Well, instructions are for girls!
What's that? Love letters?
No, I've got all the letters delivered to this building.
You've got the neighbours' letters?
I'm sure my examination results are here.
Where are the boys?
They've installed my computer!
I think so.
- Is that normal? - Bridget!
Nick? Hector?
What are you doing?
Man Olympics. Challenge Two.
What kind of a challenge?
Who can go the longest without...you know...
Falling down? Sneezing? Jumping?
No, no. Without going...
Without doing...
You want to spend a penny?
Spend a penny? I don't want to go shopping!
No, no, no. She means...
Stop thinking about your challenge and follow me.
Maybe I've passed!
Maybe I've failed!
You're not going anywhere until it works.
- Oh, no! - Here, let me try.
- You think you can do better? - I know I can do better.
I know a way from my country.
- Really? - Really.
My father taught me.
Yes, we have that way in England too.
- Hi, guys. - Hi.
Oh, no! What happened?
- It was like that before. - It was not like that before.
Sorry.
What are you doing?
Man Olympics. Challenge Three.
Hi. I need a man.
No, you idiot!
I need a man to fix the computer I bought.
Tomorrow? Good.
And I'd like him to be tall, dark, handsome...
Great, thanks. Bye.
At last, a real man.
Hi, I need a man.
It was like that before.
- It was not like that before. - Sorry.
It's Nick's phone.
You have 23 new messages.
Message one...
Hi, bro. I've got all my friends to call you.
I hear you and Bridget are history.
That's great news. I didn't like her anyway.
Message two...
Hi, Nick. Izzie here. Melanie asked me to give you a call.
I hear you and Bridget are history.
Hello. What?
Nicky Wick- wick is not here.
Is that Emma?
Nick's told me all about you.
Yeah. You and your moustache.
Nick!
Mr Postman?
Man Olympics. Challenge Five.
Tug- of- war to see who is the strongest.
They had a tug- of- war here?
Yes. They are so stupid!
- Who won? - I won.
What's wrong?
I want my examination results.
- Where's the post? - Calm down.
- The postman! - The computer man!
Well, hello there.
Come in!
But...
I know what you're going to say.
- But... - It was like that when I bought it.
So what do you think?
It looks broken.
- Well, can you repair it? - No.
- You can't repair it? - No.
- You don't know how to? - No.
Well, how can you be a repairman, then?
I'm not.
- You're not a repairman? - No.
Well, what are you, then?
I deliver special letters.
My letter!
Annie Taylor?
- Yes! - This is for you.
Man Olympics. New challenge. First one to get...
Annie's letter!
It's mine!
I can't look! You read it.
Pass!
Computer problem, miss?
I can fix anything.
My hero!
Thank goodness you're here.
How did he do that?
- Peter? - Annie?
- It is you! - Yes.
He's Peter, an old friend.
It was so clever of you to fix the computer.
Good- looking and intelligent.
A rare combination.
Right!
That's it!
Man Olympics!
New challenge.
What challenge?
Let's see who the real men are.
Hector and me, or you two.
- OK. - What's the challenge?
- Let us decide. - Yes, we'll decide.
Next time in Extra...
Annie gets a new job.
So does Hector.
And why does Nick become a beauty queen?
And why does Nick become a beauty queen?
This is the story of Bridget and Annie, who share a flat in London,
and the boys next door, Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.
Bridget and Hector work for Channel 9
and Annie wants a job too,
but Nick just wants babes, babes and babes.
Stand by for Extra.
'Dear Miss Taylor, thank you for your recent CV,
'but at present we haven't got anything to suit your talents.'
'Dear Miss Taylor... Blah- blah- blah- blah.'
How surprising.
What is the point of all that studying if I cannot get a job?
Right, last one.
Paws crossed, Charley.
'Dear Miss Taylor...'
What is the point of having a car if you cannot park?
'Thank you for your recent letter...'
She's got four eyes and reptile skin.
'We are very pleased to tell you...'
- She sees your car... - '..that you have been successful...'
She slides over to it.
She's got you!
'..in your application as a...'
Yes, she is the...
Traffic warden!
- Correct. - What?
I've just got a ticket.
I've just got a job.
As a traffic warden?
- Annie, you'll be one of them. - One of who?
Annie is going to be a traffic warden.
Well, I have to pass the entrance exam first.
- What is a traffic warden? - Someone who spoils your day.
A traffic warden is someone who stops stupid people
parking their stupid cars in stupid places.
See? It's started.
I didn't know you wanted to be a traffic warden.
I didn't know either, but no one else would have me.
But it is good for the environment to reduce the cars on our roads.
- So you will have another exam? - Yeah.
Another exam.
Well, don't worry. I can help.
I've got experience of traffic wardens.
OK, Hector, you can be the driver...
and I will be the traffic warden.
- OK. - You can't park there.
- Yes, I can. - No, you can't.
- Yes, I can. - No.
Yes, I can, because this is a bus stop and I am driving a bus.
The excuses I hear.
Sorry, sorry. Emergency appointment.
- Bad leg. - Which leg?
No, no, no, it's not me. It's my hamster.
Sweet.
Sorry, Eric! Eric?
Surely we can come to some arrangement?
Of course we can, sir.
You can pay for the ticket, I can go home for my tea.
Sorry, sorry, but I was late for lunch and there wasn't a place to park.
But surely we can sort this out?
When a beautiful woman meets a handsome man...
Well, you're in my little black book now, darling.
I've only been two minutes!
Well, I have started...so I'll finish.
Sorry, I got stuck up a chimney.
Yes, and there are fairies at the bottom of my garden, sir.
Rudolph!
Rudolph!
See? Now you know what to expect.
I can't wait.
'Late ironing - penalty Â£20.'
'Late washing- up - penalty Â£5.'
Annie.
I need a drink.
I don't believe it. She's clamped the fridge.
Did you have a good day, Bridget?
- Yes, I did. - Why is the TV moved?
Annie towed it away this morning. No licence.
Really, Hector, you must talk to her.
She's too serious about this traffic warden exam.
I do try, but if I stop to talk to her,
she gives me a parking ticket.
Anyway, exciting news.
Channel Nine is presenting the Miss Euro babe Beauty Contest.
And guess who Eunice wants to present the show.
- Me! - You, Hector!
I could enter the contest myself, but I might...
- Frighten the judges? - Win.
The programme will need my expertise.
And mine!
- So will you present the show, Hector? - When is it?
- Next Friday. - That's the day of Annie's exam.
A double contest, then.
But you'll be OK. I'll help you.
Think of those babes!
It's my job to give you all the information about the girls,
so nothing can go wrong.
- Well, OK, then. - Good. Great.
So, when do we start?
We?
Well, Hector will need an interpreter
to help him talk to all those babes.
Nick, you're not getting involved in this show.
What is the point of having a car if you cannot park?
- What is a traffic warden? - Someone who spoils your day.
Sorry, sorry, but I was late for lunch and there wasn't a place to park.

You have a very difficult job.
You are right.
But a very important job.
Thank you, sir.
No, I mean it.
I know, but I've still got to give you a ticket.
That's OK. It's your job.
There you are, sir. Have a nice day.
Thank you. And you.
How nice to meet a reasonable customer.
Why are you dressed to go to war, Annie?
I'm going for my traffic warden exam.
Are you expecting trouble?
There are a lot of difficult motorists out there.
What have you got there?
It's the information for the Euro babe contestants.
Hector must learn what each girl likes and dislikes.
- Anything interesting? - Let's see.
She likes children and animals.
She likes children and animals.
She likes children and animals.
This one's different. Miss Holland Babe.
She likes reading and her ambition...
is to learn to read.
Here's another one. Miss Belgium Babe.
Her ambition is to go to the moon.
But she doesn't like flying.
Well, it should be an exciting show.
I hope so. Well, at least Hector is ready for it.
And so...
am I.
I said no.
Cue Hector.
Good evening and a very warm well...come

This is why I didn't want you here.
What's that?
Miss Englandbabe is where?
She's been clamped?
Well, tell her to get a taxi, then.
She won't leave her Porsche?
I'll come and get her.
Who's going to do this?
Listen to me.
You have one simple job.
You must tell Hector who each girl is.
Their names are on these cards. Got it?
Do not mess it up.
Who? Me?
Thank you, Miss Swedenbaby!
Miss Finlandbabe!
Miss Finlandbaby!
Well, good luck with the elephants.
Thank you, Miss Finlandbaby.

Thank you, Miss Italybaby.
Miss Hungarybaby!
Are you Hungary? Are you Hungary?
You are not Miss Hungarybaby.
So welcome, Miss...oh, no.

She's a bit emotional, I think.
We've got big problems.
Miss Englandbabe will not come here.

But we've got to have a Miss Englandbabe. We are in London.
Yes, Eunice? Right away, Eunice.
Eunice wants to see me. Now.

My kind of girl!
And dancing with women.
I think you mean men. Dancing with...

What do you think you're doing?
You said you needed a Miss Englandbaby fast.
I meant a woman.
- Nice legs, Nick. - Thanks, Annie.
- Hi, Annie. - Thank you, Miss Englandbaby.
And next, we find out why our babies
want to represent their country.
There are beautiful women everywhere.
I know!
Miss Englandbabe is still missing.
What are we going to do?
Eunice said she'll fire me if I don't find someone.
Oh, no! No.
Bingo!
I hear we have a replacement for our last contestant.
It is the new Miss Englandbaby!
So tell me, Miss Englandbaby...
why do you want to represent your country?
I want to represent England
because I care about the environment, pollution.
I care about people.

I hate violence.
I hate violence too... but I love Ricky Chung.
Hector, I tell you, this is a very old English tradition.
- Really? - Really.
Now, put your blindfold on.
No looking, OK?
What is Nick doing?
You know, being a genius.
Right.
Right, now you can choose one.
Nick, what are you doing?
- Our floor! - Well...
We must teach Hector how to be English.
Not an English idiot.
OK, Nick, now is your turn.
And this is an old English tradition?
Absolutely. You need a shower!
I think I already have had one.
- That'll be for me. - How do you know?
Hello.
Yes, it is for you, Nick.
Naturally.
Hello. Hi.
Yeah?
Yeah!
Really? Great!
I'll prepare for it. Bye.
Nick, why do you always use our number?
You're so, so...
Idiotic? Stupid? Vain? Choose one.
I have just got an audition for the new...
Ricky Chung film!
As I was saying,
you're so clever, wonderful, brilliant.
- Ricky Chung. - Yeah.
Ricky Chung.
I always knew you'd make it to the top.
Ricky Chung.
Nick's going to be in a film... with Ricky Chung!
Wait a minute. He only has an audition.
Oh, I'm sure he'll get it.
Then I can interview Ricky Chung.
Maybe Ricky'll fancy me.
You? In your dreams!
Ricky and Bridget. Houses in London, Hong Kong...
Yeah, you'll have a house in London
and he'll have a house in Hong Kong.
I should get an oriental style.
New clothes. Come shopping with me?
I can't.
You can't come shopping?
I have a group meeting.
Animal Lovers Against Violence.
And is Hector going with you?
- Hector. - What about Hector?
Well, I've been thinking about our relationship.
Wimp!
But Hector's a good man!
He ironed your trousers!
Yes.
Yes, he did.
Hello.
Hello, Bridget. How are you?
Eunice! Very well, thanks.
Good.
Channel Nine has to lose people.
I know. I heard.
And guess who is the first person to go.
Who?
You. You're fired. Ciao!
Wait!
But I'm getting an interview with Ricky Chung.
Ricky Chung?
If you get the interview, you keep your job. No pressure.
Hi, Annie.
I've just been watching Charlotte's Kitchen on television.
Not again!
Look, I've made you a cake.
A cake? Really?
Here, try a piece.
OK.
- What's this? - Flower.
Flower? Why?
Well, Charlotte said you have to put some flower in the cake.
No, Hector.
Some flour.
Some flowers.
Well, still...
Tastes good, doesn't it?
Hey, Hector.
I have got an audition for the new Ricky Chung film.
- Superb! - Superb!
One question. Who is Ricky Chung?
You know. Ricky...
Chung.
- Ricky Chung. - Yeah!
I know him! He was in the Chinese restaurant, wasn't he?

So, will you help me to prepare?
I would love to.
Ricky Chung film.
- Superb! - Superb!
- What's this? - Flower.
Then I can interview Ricky Chung.
Ricky and Bridget.
I hate violence. Violence makes me sick.
Wonderful. I totally agree, Richard.
But I love animals.
I love animals too.
You must come and meet my dog Charley.
- We have so much in common. - I know.
Hector...
Come and sit down. I think we should talk.
OK.
What do you want to talk about?
I think we should see other people.
See other people?
But I see other people. I see Bridget, I see Nick, I see the postman.
No, I mean we should...
see other people.
Fine.
Guys, help me prepare my interview with Ricky Chung.
- Bridget, it's not a good time. - No, no.
It is a very good time.
Sit down, Bridget.
- So, you are Ricky Chung. - I am Ricky Chung.
- Yes. - And who are you?
I'm me, silly!
So, Ricky...
What kind of...women do you like?
Well, I like beautiful women...like you.
Correct answer!
And tell me, Ricky...
Do you...have a girlfriend now?
Well...
Sweetie?
Oh, Ricky.
Hector...
hold this.
Thanks.
Now...I want you to attack me.
- Attack you? - Yeah.
- Not now. - So when?
It must be a surprise.
- Why? - So I must always be ready.
Good. Very good!
I am feeling good!
I'm feeling fit!
Nick, are you being violent?
No.
Thanks. Must go. It's my audition.
OK, Nick.
OK, Nick!
Let's see what you can do.
Excellent. Excellent.
- What? - You've got the part.
I have? Yes!
Next.
Hey, baby.
Nick.
You are looking at the new Ricky Chung.
Nick, that's wonderful.
Ricky... Ricky Chung!
What are you doing? Are you crazy?
But you told me to attack you.
But not now.
Not now!
Amateurs!
So...
- When can I? - What?
- Meet him! - Who?
Ricky Chung!
But I love animals.
I love animals too.
Hector.
I am feeling good.
So when?
Ricky Chung.
Hi, I'm Nick.
Nick, Ricky never talks at work.
Very professional.
So what do you want me to do?
- You just stand still. - OK.
Excellent.
What is this?
- This is your role. - But we are partners.
Partners?
Yes, we fight the criminals together.
No, no, no. You play the stupid friend.
- The stupid friend? - Exactly.
Right, let's try it again. Ricky, action.
So how was your first day with Ricky?
Great! We get on very well.
There must be so much to learn.
Yeah! I taught Ricky a lot today.
- OK, Nick. Bend over. - Excuse me?
I said bend over.
I thought so.
Hello, nurse.
Could I have a bath, please?
Hi, Bridget.
So, when can I meet Ricky?
No Ricky?
No interview.
No interview - no job!
Poor Nick.
Nick, how are you feeling?
- Ricky! - Richard?
Annie?
What are you doing here?
This is Richard. I met him at my protest group.
Ricky Chung!
Please...please can I have an interview?
Bridget, this isn't Ricky Chung, this is Richard.
No, no, no. This is Ricky Chung.
Richard?
Yeah. Ricky Chung is my film name.
But I thought you hated violence.
You lied to me!
Ricky!
- I brought you some cake. - Thanks, Hector.
Hector, will you forgive me?
Of course.
How fascinating.
Anti- violence, and a kung fu star!
It'll make a great interview.
Eunice will love it!
And so will I.
Next time in Extra...
Charley enters a dog show.

And guess who's in trouble with the police.
And guess who's in trouble with the police.
This is the story of Bridget and Annie, who share a flat in London,
and the boys next door, Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.
Annie and Hector want to be together.
Bridget wants to meet a new man.
And Nick wants to be rich and famous.
Stand by for Extra.
Charley, look at that.
Hola, Charley.
What's wrong?
Shaving cream!
Whipping cream!
Hector.
Next time you go shopping...
kitchen, bathroom, OK?
Bathroom, kitchen, got it.
What are you watching?
It's a dog show.
I like that!
I didn't know you liked dogs.
I don't like dogs.
I like those women with their dogs.
Charley likes the dogs.
The lady dogs.
You can enter the dog show this year and win two thousand pounds.
What?
Hector, slap me.
Thanks.
How much did she say?
Two thousand pounds.
We must enter this dog show with Charley.
All right, let's do it.
Yes!
Oh, no!
Hello. Earth to Bridget.
Earth to Bridget.
Bridget!
What are you looking for?
My new T- shirt. I'm meeting my boyfriend...
What boyfriend?
My new boyfriend.
Tell me everything.
Well...
his name's Philip, he's very elegant and...
Annie, we've had a really...
good...idea!
Wait.
Careful.
We've just seen a dog show on TV.
Yes, that's right.
A really good dog show.
Do you like dog shows, Annie?
I...
hate them!
They are cruel.
Not all dog shows, Annie.
Yes, Nick, all dog shows.
They are... They are...horrible.
You have to respect animals.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You are so right, Annie.
So what shall we do?
We will have to train Charley ourselves,
without Annie knowing.
Hey.
Hey.
Forget that.
Read this.
What? 'How to train your dog'.
Now we can train Charley.
Charley. Here, boy.
Sit.
Sit!
Good dog.
Good trainer.
Charley's not there.
Charley's not there?
Annie has taken him to the vet.
- The vet? - The vet. The animal doctor.
Well, we can still start training.
We can? How?
Sit!
I said 'sit'.
Sit.
Good boy, good boy.
Now roll over.
Roll over.
Good doggie, Charley.
Roll over.
Roll over, Hector.
Good boy!
Good boy, Hector. Good boy.
Now, now, I...
- I want to be the dog. - No, no, I am the dog.
I want...
- I don't know these people! - Hi, Bridget.
Well, they're not my friends.
What are they doing?
Well, you've heard of yoga?
Yes.
Well, this is a new type of yoga - dog yoga.
Yeah, dog yoga.
Do- ga.
Fantastic!
Come on, Bridget, introduce me to these spiritual boys.
Philip.
Hector and Nick.
Hiya.
Are dogs allowed on the sofa?
Maybe we should eat out.
Come on, Philip.
I don't like that man.
I don't think he likes you either.
Was that Bridget's new boyfriend?
Yep.
That's right, Charley, he's a bad man.
Top dog.
- Tell me everything. - Well...
- Let's do it! - Yes!
Fantastic!
That's right, Charley, he's a bad man.
Come on, Charley.
Wait.
Where are you taking him?
For a walk.
Time to train Charley.
Let me take him.
- You'll take him for his walk? - Yeah.
OK.
Where's the kettle?
Bridget.
I'll buy Charley a nice ribbon,
then the lady dogs will love him.
Hey, Charley. Come on, walkies!
Hey, Nick. Catch!
Bridget, that's my Walkman.
Well, you take my things.
I don't take your things.
Yes, you do.
Where's my necklace, then?
I haven't got your necklace.
Well, I think you have. And my photo frame.
I haven't got your photo frame.
- Yes, you have. - No, I haven't!
- Yes, you have! - No, I haven't!
Yes, you have!
Girls, girls, please.
Don't touch my things.
Hello, hello.
I didn't touch your things.
Sit!
Annie is so angry.
What have you done?
Me? Nothing.
She has been fighting with Bridget.
The girls have been fighting. I missed it.
Anyway, how was your walk with Charley?
Great.
Women love Charley.
Nick, what a handsome dog you have.
Look, I've brought him a ribbon for the show.
- And where is he? - Where is who?
Charley, the dog.
Stay there, good boy.
A quick pint.
'You are too cruel to own a dog.
'He is safe with me.'
But he was only tied up at that lamppost for...
..a bit.
What's going on?
It's called...
Dog yoga.
Very nice.
Oh, no. Not dog yoga again.
Talking of dogs, where is Charley?
- He's asleep. - He's ill.
- He's having his hair cut. - He's busy.
So he's asleep and ill and busy,
and having his hair cut?
Yeah.
OK.
We have to get Charley back!
Good boy.
Good boy, good boy.
Where is Charley?
- He's asleep. - He's ill.
- Having his hair cut. - He's busy.
I didn't touch your things!
Where's my necklace, then?
Nick.
Hector, hey.
Don't worry, I've found him.
- I've found him! - Great!
The other phone is ringing. See you later. Bye.
Yeah!
Hello?
Police?
What?
You found our dog!
Great, thanks very much.
Bye.
But...
if the police have found our dog...
whose dog has Nick found?
Sorry. I'm sorry.
Look, I'm sorry. I thought it was mine!
Up, up, up.
Good dog. Up... Don't...
Hello.
Nick, where are you?
The police station?
You took a dog from an old woman?
Nick, how could you?
OK.
OK.
I am coming.
That woman, she really went for you and she was old!
I thought she was Mike Tyson's mother.
We must go, the dog show.
Hi, guys.
Hi, Charley.
Why are you wearing that?
We were taking photographs.
- Were we? - Yes.
- Taking photographs? - Yes.
I'm meeting Philip tonight and I can't find my earrings.
Come on, they must be somewhere.
You.
You've stolen them.
I told you, I haven't stolen anything.
- Yes, you have. You're a thief! - I am not a thief! I'm...
Whoa, ladies, no fighting here.
Break it up!
Where's the fridge?
- Hello and welcome to Croft's Dog Show. - Bridget!
A dog show, how stupid.
Where is the fridge?
Where's Charley?
Charley!
Charley.
Charley and the fridge have gone.
Charley has taken the fridge!
Well, it will be a great day here at Croft's, this annual event...
Charley?
..with the culmination of months of work for dog owners everywhere.
These dogs are trained to the highest standards and are a credit to their owners.
It looks hopeful.
Oh, yes.
It looks very hopeful. Look at her!
Look after Charley.
Hey, hello there.
Look, there's Hector and Charley.
And there's Nick!
Who's that woman?
It's a very big dog.
That really is a big dog.
Yes, I know.
Your attention, please. The dog show winner is...
Charley, with his trainers Hector and Nick.
We've won, we've won!
Two thousand pounds!
Congratulations.
Thanks, Annie.
But you hate dog shows.
Well, if Charley wins, then that's different.
And you won two thousand pounds.
Well, not exactly.
We won two thousand pounds to spend in Dog's Heaven.
This is great.
Smells nice and...
gets rid of fleas.
I'm ready, Philip.
Bridget.
You look nice.
We're going out for dinner, a very romantic dinner.
You stupid dog, get off me!
Charley, stop it!
- What is he doing? - Get off him!
What?
My scarf!
My jewellery.
My photo frame and more!
Philip, you've been stealing our things.
You're the thief.
Well, I...
I...
Get him, Charley!
Charley, Charley, Charley.
He's a thief!
Your boyfriend is a thief.
Well, who can blame him?
He took souvenirs
to remind him of me.
So romantic.
Next time in Extra...
Annie is a hypnotist.
Nick and Hector are party entertainers.
But what happens when they lose the birthday girl?
But what happens when they lose the birthday girl?
This is the story of Bridget and Annie, who share a flat in London,
and the boys next door, Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.
Hector and Annie love each other.
Bridget loves herself.
And Nick loves babes, motorbikes and pizza
but really needs to make some money.
Stand by for Extra.
You are feeling very sleepy.
You want to be a cat.
Now, Charley, say meow.
No, Charley, let's try again.
I give up. Here you are, Charley. Good boy.
I don't need a dog, I need someone more stupid.
Perfect. The boys.
Hello, boys. Come and sit down.
- What are you doing? - I am going to hypnotise you.
Hypnotise?
Yeah, you know. Hypnotise.
You are feeling very sleepy.
You are a baby.
Mama, mama.
You are five years old.
He stole my toy!
You are 12 years old.
Hey, baby, wanna dance?
I know!
It sounds fun.
It's not about fun. Hypnotism can help you with your problems.
I don't have any problems.
Are you ready?
Now, close your eyes and relax.
I'm going to take you back.
Back.
Back.
And open your eyes.
You made it.
- Well? - Have you done it?
Yes, all done.
Now, I am going to say a word to you
and when you hear that word,
you are going to react.
Ready?
Butterfly.
Anything?
No.
I'll try again.
Butterfly.
Butterfly.
Butterfly!
- I don't think it's working, Annie. - You're very good.
No one can control the great minds of Hector and Nick.
So where did I go wrong?
'A hypnotic state can last for two days.'
So if someone says the word 'butterfly' in the next two days...
Oh, Nick!
- Why did you do that? - It's so obvious!
Sue is having an affair with Jim's brother.
Don't tell me.
Now it's time for On The Road with Bridget Evans...
Look, it's Bridget.
If I said 'children's party' to you, you'd say,,,
No, thanks!
..jelly, ice cream, pass the parcel, pin the tail on the donkey.
Hey, pin the tail on the donkey.
Pin the tail on the donkey?
Great game.
Poor donkey.
But not for the lucky children of the rich and famous.
At their parties they have elephant rides,,,
So they pin the tail on the elephant?
Amazing cakes, top- class entertainers.
Parties like these can cost thousands of pounds
but listen to the laughter of these lovely children.
They love it!
- Give me that. - I want that!
Not now, sweetie, I'm on television.
- But I want it. - Be a nice child and go away.
- Give it to me! - I said get lost!
Mum, she hit me.
This is Bridget Evans for Channel 9, Knights bridge.
Get the police, Mummy!
Will you keep your child quiet?
- That's it! - What?
Children's parties.
Rich children's parties.
You can't go, you are too old.
No, she said top- class entertainers.
That's us.
We will be party entertainers to rich children for loads of money!
Don't we need an elephant?
No, we've got you.
You are feeling very sleepy.
Butterfly!
I don't think it's working, Annie.
'A hypnotic state can last for two days.'
We'll be party entertainers to rich children for loads of money.
OK, guys, what do you think of this?
'We are top- class children's entertainers.
- 'We make them laugh...' - We make them cry.
It's not like that, Hector.
'Book Posh Parties for the best party in the world.
'Only millionaires need apply.'
- What do you think? - I think you'd be lucky to get one reply.
Hello.
Yes, this is Posh Parties.
Who is calling, please?
Mrs George Ducas?
Not the wife of Mr George Ducas?
- Who? - George Ducas, the Hollywood director.
You know who it is, don't you?
Victoria, Lucas's mother.
Lucas, say hello to Uncle Nicky- Wicky!
Hello.
You'd like to book a party, for your stepdaughter?
She loves fairies?
Well, I have just the fairy for you.
Princess Nicky.
And here she is.
Hello, Princess Nicky speaking.
Yes, of course I know what little girls like.
I used to be one myself, you know.
Certainly, Mrs Ducas.
Daisy's birthday on Friday, we'll be there.
Bye.
Oh, no!
Nick, that's fantastic news.
- It's your first booking! - Yeah!
But I will have to go to the home of George Ducas
dressed as a fairy princess!
What will Victoria say?
Who cares? This is my chance to get into Hollywood.
It's the nearest you'll ever get to Hollywood.
Anyway, what can you do?
- What can I do? - What can you do to entertain children?
I...can juggle.
So can I.
Is that it?
No, I can...do lots of things.
Anyway, I will have my assistants,
Hector and...
I'm working on Friday. She's not.
- Bridget. - Oh, no, no.
Children and I do not work well together.
Oh, well, suit yourself.
It's only the home of George Ducas
with the children of Hollywood stars.
Celebrities?
All right, but I'm not dressing up.
- I feel ridiculous! - You feel ridiculous? What about me?
There.
- This is the last box. - Great!
Are you ready?
Nick!
Princess Nicky.
Hi, Victoria. I mean...
Hello, Mrs Ducas.
So, how's the acting going?
Great, great.
This is just a temporary job.
Is George here?
He's next door, chatting to a few friends.
Catherine Zeta- Jones,
Orlando Bloom,
Jude Law.
That's nice.
Well, let's bring in the birthday girl.
Daisy, in you come.
Have a good time.
Anyway, I'm just going next door to have drinkies.
You'd like to book a party?
- I feel ridiculous! - You feel ridiculous? What about me?
Have a good time.
Hello, little fairies.
My name is Princess Nicky.
Hello!
And this is Princess Hector- ina.
And this...is Tinkerbell.
She's really old.
Now, Princess Hectorina is going to show you a magic trick.
Aren't you, Princess Hectorina?
Now, we are going to have a magical time this afternoon, aren't we?
Now, would you like to meet Mr Whizzy?
Of course you would.
Come on, Daisy.
Come and meet Mr Whizzy.
Now, Daisy, is Mr Whizzy in the hat?
Go on, put your hand in.
Not too far!
Well, is he there?
No!
No, he's not.
Now, give the hat a magic tap.
Careful!
You'll give him a headache.
Who is this?
It's Mr Whizzy!
Say hello to Mr Whizzy.
Mr Whizzy hasn't got any clothes on!
Thank you, Daisy!
Now, Tinkerbell, stop that and come over here.
You've got hairy legs and a hairy chest!
Now, Daisy, that's not a very nice thing to say about Tinkerbell.
I think she meant you.
Now...
I am going to make someone disappear.
Who shall it be?
You!
Daisy, do you want to be part of the magic trick again?
Hey, Daisy!
Come on.
Magic Wigwam!
Now, Daisy, this is Princess Nicky's magical wigwam.
If you go in there, you'll find a wonderful, magical land.
- Do you want to go in? - No!
Of course you do. Now, in you go.
Come on, poppet.
Get in.
There we are. Marvellous!
Now, we say the magical words -
Princess Nicky- Wicky- Wocky,
hey, presto, ping!
Is Daisy still here?
She's gone!
She must be having a wonderful time in the magical land.
But it's time to come home now, Daisy!
Princess Nicky- Wicky- Wocky, ping!
And hello, Daisy.
- Where did she go? - I don't know.
I'll get the cake. She'll come out then.
Where is she? Where is Daisy?
What a good game, Princess Nicky!
Can't you remember where Daisy is? Really!
Your mind is like a butterfly's!
Butterfly!
The cake!
Come out, Daisy, wherever you are.
We've got a surprise for you.
She'll come out when she sees this!
Happy birthday, Daisy.
Cue, Bridget!
What's going on?
Annie?
Bridget, I forgot to say,
whatever you do, do not mention the word butterfly.
Why not?
It's the word I used to hypnotise Nick and Hector.
They might behave strangely.
Stranger than usual?
Yes.
I think it worked.
So how do you dehypnotise them?
There's a special word.
What is it?
Dragonfly... Bee...
No, wasp... Ant...
Dragonfly, bee, wasp, ant...
Nothing's happening!
I'll be right there.
Hurry!
- What the... - Hey, Victoria, come and rock!
Where's Daisy?
What's going on?
The thing is,
we were doing this magic trick and...
We lost her.
Nick, how could you?
That's it, I'm calling the police.
Police.
Daisy, darling!
Wicked!
She was in Princess Nicky's van.
So, have you remembered the word?
Yes. Caterpillar.
What a mess!
I'm not paying you.
Well, then, you won't mind
that I've put parking tickets on four Mercedes,
five Ferraris and two Porsches, illegally parked outside.
Catherine parked outside
and Jude did too.
All of George's friends parked...
Surely we can come to some kind of an arrangement.
Very well.
Well, I didn't meet George...
It was a great party, though, and the money was good too.
- You'll need that for your fine. - What fine?
We had to tow your van away.
I'm sorry, I didn't know it was yours.
What?
Come back!
Next time in Extra...
Annie is reading her crystal ball.
Bridget wants to meet a handsome stranger.
And what is scaring Hector and Nick?
And what is scaring Hector and Nick?
This is the story of Bridget and Annie, who share a flat in London
and the boys next door - Nick, and his friend Hector from Argentina.
Hector and Annie still love each other.
Bridget still loves herself.
And Nick loves babes, motorbikes and pizza.
Stand by for Extra.
And I can see a great big bowl of dog food.
And on the bowl, it says a name.
It says...
'Charley'!
It must be teatime, Charley.
Guess what!
You've just met Brad Pitt.
What? Don't be ridiculous, Annie.
I've just been to see Rose Marie.
- Who's Rose Marie? - My fortune teller.
And she says I'm going to meet a tall, dark, handsome stranger.
Oooh! When?
She didn't say.
- Where? - She didn't say.
It must be true then.
Maybe I'll meet him at tonight's Halloween party.
Have you read your horoscopes for today?
- No. - Read mine.
Aquarius, Libra, Leo...
Ah, Taurus - the Bull.
'Taurus - today, you will be in for a big surprise.'
Ooh, goody.
I'm getting a name...
It's...Nick.
Gigi, you must be psychic.
- Sidekick? - No.
Not 'sidekick', 'psychic'. A fortune- teller.
Someone who can see the future.
Ah, like Nostradamus?
- Who? - Kind of.
Like horoscopes, or tarot.
The tarot. The Death card.
Look, it's Bridget with no make- up.
Like... having the palm of your hand read.
Ah, rubbish! There's nothing there.
What a surprise!
Come here, give me your hand.
I'll give you a lesson.
This one is your life line.
- This one is your love line. - Oh, yes?
And this one is your...punch line!
Punch line?
She means it's the end of my lesson.
Hey, Hector.
What happens when you go to a fortune- teller's house?
Come in!
Ha ha!
Let's see what your horoscope says.
You don't believe all that rubbish?
Rose Marie says Bridget is going to meet a tall, dark, handsome stranger.
Hector...
Bridget, this is my tall, dark, handsome stranger. Get your own!
- Who is Rose Marie? - My fortune- teller.
Is she good- looking? Could she find me a cute babe?
- Do you want to hear your horoscope? - Go on then. Aquarius.
Aquarius, eh? I should've guessed.
'This week, beware of black hair
and the number three.'
That means that three babes with black hair are going to chase me.
- Spooky! - Can I be Aquarius?
- No! - Come on, Hector, let's go out.
I'm going to meet some black- haired babes.
Put that umbrella down - it's very unlucky.
But I'm feeling lucky.
I wish I could meet a tall, dark, handsome stranger.
Well, let me look into my crystal ball.
Annie, that's a goldfish bowl.
So? I got it right for Charley. Didn't I, Charley?
That could be my stranger now.
Hello, Bernard.
Hello, Bernard. How are you?
Not happy, not happy at all.
I've lost my Marbles.
Oh, dear, Bernard's lost his marbles.
What?
You mean Marbles your cat?
And she's not well - she's got a cold.
Oh, well, I'm sure you'll find her.
We'll look out for her, Bernard.
I hope so. Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
Poor Bernard.
He's lost his marbles.
It had to happen.
And on the bowl, it says a name.
It says...Charley!
Hello, Bernard.
Oh, dear, Bernard's lost his marbles.
You don't believe all that rubbish, do you?
..are going to chase me.
Spooky!
I'm feeling lucky!
This is a true story about a man and wife on their honeymoon.
They were in the car, it was late.
The wife broke her mirror, which means seven years bad luck.
Just then, they ran out of petrol.
So, the man told the wife to go for petrol.
He's the man, he should've gone.
Equal opportunities.
The wife was gone for a long time.
Then...
He heard a noise on the roof of the car.
It got louder.
And then...
his wife appeared.
She smiled and walked away.
The noise was very loud.
The man got out of his car and standing on the roof, he saw...
a madman holding his wife's head!
So, the banging was...
..her head?
But he'd just seen his wife.
That...
was her ghost.
Is that a true story?
Yeah.
- Tell us another. - No, don't.
I mean, it was a bit dull, wasn't it?
Come on, let's go shopping for the party.
Yeah, I'm in the mood now.
Are you coming, Nick?
No. See you later.
One, two...
- Beware of black hair... - Three apples.
..and the number three.
So what? There are three apples.
Big deal.
Seven years of bad luck...
What rubbish!
I think I'll go back to my apartment now.
Black cat...black hair.
Right, keep calm.
Nice pussy.
Who's there?
Number...number three.
Stop!
Nick? Nick? Nick?
He's coming round.
What's going on? Why are you dressed like that?
Nick, have you forgotten?
It's Halloween. We're going to the party.
Oh, yeah.
I cannot get this knife into the pumpkin. Can you...?
Yeah.
Trick or treat?
Treat.
There you are.
Thank you.
- Aren't they sweet? - Yeah.
Sweet.
This is a true story about a man and wife on their honeymoon.
I think I'll go back to my apartment now.
One, two...three apples.
Those witches were very cute.
- I think the small one fancied you. - You think so?
Boys, they weren't pretending.
They really were witches.
They were ugly enough.
Hey, the lights have gone out.
It must be the storm.
A power cut!
What was that?
Who was that?
Bernard, what are you doing on the roof?
I still can't find my Marbles.
- Your marbles? - His cat.
Bernard, I really don't think that you should be on the roof.
Bernard, are you OK?
Yeah, fine. I'll kill that cat when I find it.
I know, we'll light a candle.
Well, there's no television, so I guess it's time for bed.
Oh, no!
What's the matter, boys? Are you scared of the dark?
No.
Well, if you're not scared of the dark, then let's play a game.
- A game? - Let's get the ouija board out.
B - that's you, Bridget.
Fan- ci- es...
N - that's you, Nick.
Bridget fancies Nick!
Don't be so childish. Give that to me.
It's getting warm. I can feel...
It's starting to move.
H - that's you, Hector.
Depart. But I am not leaving.
Depart.
'Dearly departed' means dead.
That's it, I am leaving.
Hector, sit down!
- You are moving the glass, Bridget. - No, I'm not.
N - I think it's for you, Nick.
Oh, great, it'll be about babes.
Three what?
Didn't your horoscope say, 'Beware of the number three?'
Oh, yeah.
You don't believe that rubbish, do you?
Of course I do. Don't you?
Well, the lights are back on.
I'm tired.
Why don't you depart then?
Great idea. Come on, Hector, let's go.
- Hector? - Eh?
Do you believe in horoscopes?
- Of course not. - No, of course not.
They're silly.
'Beware of black hair and the number three.'
- Rubbish! - Yeah.
It could've meant, 'Beware of those three witches we met at the party.'
Well, they did have black hair.
Or those three trick or treaters.
Trick or treat?
Or the black cat.
- What was that noise? - Probably the wind.
Yeah, the wind.
- Hector? - Eh?
Can I get into your bed?
OK.
- I'm not afraid of the dark. - Nor am I.
I've only got one torch - it's good to share.
The storm's finished.
What's that noise?
It's in the room.
It's getting nearer.
- Who's that? - I don't know.
Nick, there is something touching my legs.
- Well, it's not me. - I know.
But there is something touching my legs.
Bernard, did you hear that scream?
What are you doing?
I think Marbles is in there.
Right, we're going in.
Hector, Nick? What's the matter?
Marbles, there you are!
How's your cold?
Are you two OK?
What's wrong?
Has the cat got your tongue?
Next time in Extra::
Nick goes shopping.
Hector tells Annie the truth.
And why has Bridget got so many admirers?
And why has Bridget got so many admirers?
And why has Bridget got so many admirers?
This is the story of Bridget and Annie, who share a flat in London
and the boys next door - Nick, and his friend Hector from Argentina.
Bridget wants to marry a millionaire.
Nick wants to be a millionaire.
Hector is a millionaire.
But Annie doesn't really care.
Stand by for Extra.
He's been gone for ages.
Do you think he did it?
Nah. I bet he didn't dare.
Well, there you go.
One bottle of milk...
one tin of tuna...
Bravo, Nick!
Come on, Bridget, your turn.
Do your dare.
Bernard, I love you!
You're the one for me.
Please, let's run away together.
All right, Bernard?
Hello, Bernard. OK?
Let's do it again. Tell the truth, or do a dare.
Now, do you want to tell the truth?
Well, then you have to do a dare.
Yeah, but what dare?
I know.
I dare you to...kiss Nick.
Truth or dare?
A dare.
OK, I dare you to...
copy someone in this room.
Someone in this room, eh?
Right, my turn.
A dare. I dare myself to kiss Bridget.
Not another dare! Why not the truth?
- The truth? - Yes.
Nobody wants to speak the truth.
I dare you... I dare all of you to speak the truth.
OK, let's speak the truth.
- For a whole day. - Tomorrow.
- No lies? - No lies.
And the winner...
we buy the winner dinner for two at The Ivy restaurant!
24 hours of truth.
You will tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
Welcome to the Ivy, Miss Evans.
Mr P is waiting for you at your usual table.
The whole truth and nothing but the truth.
The truth.
- What's wrong with you? - Nothing at all really.
Is there no food in your apartment?
The truth, the whole truth...
The thing is, Annie... The truth is...
on Thursdays, I never go shopping, I just take your food.
What? You mean that...?
Handy.
Hello? What?
An audition? A commercial? When?
I've got to go.
Hi, Nick.
Hi, Hector. What are you doing?
I'm writing things I don't like about Annie.
What?
Let's use the truth to make our relationship stronger.
OK.
Go on, write things I don't like about Hector.
OK. 'Things I don't like about Hector.'
I behave like a big child?!
I shout too much?
See? You are doing it again.
So, you don't like my carrot cake?
And you've never liked my carrot cake?
- No. - But you always eat it.
I didn't want to upset you.
Well, now I am cross. Very cross!
See? You are shouting again.
I do not shout too much!
Calm down, please, Annie.
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!
Hello?
John? No, I don't want to see you. Goodbye.
An old boyfriend. How strange.
So, Hector, if we're telling the truth, let me ask you...
Yes?
- Do you fancy Bridget? - No.
And before, have you ever fancied Bridget?
Well...
Out! Get out!
But, Annie...
I hate the truth!
Annie, do I look fat in these trousers?
Yes.
To tell the truth, yes, you do look fat in those trousers.
I can't change clothes, I don't have time.
And don't forget - one day of truth.
You're the one for me.
Please, let's run away together.
I dare you... I dare all of you to speak the truth.
Hello!
So, this is a commercial for yoghurt.
That's right, Nick, Yupiyoghurts.
Great!
This is the most delicious yoghurt in the world.
Wow, in the world.
So, first, we want you to eat some.
45 minutes late.
I'm sorry, Eunice.
What happened this time? A fire in the house?
A burglar? A big monster?
No. The bus...
Welcome to the Ivy, Miss Evans.
Mr P is waiting for you at your usual table.
No. I'm late because I overslept.
So, you overslept?
Of course. You do need your beauty sleep.
Now, work!
My bag. Where is it?
Bridget, you know Channel 9 wants new talent?
Have you found any?
Well, I have.
A new presenter.
Really? Who?
Me!
Look.
Hello, my darlings.
What? What?
Hello, my darlings. This is the beautiful Eunice,
bringing you delight and wonder from Nannel Chine.
From Channel 9.
Stay tuned for all my special reports.
Well, what do you think?
We want you to eat some and then say, 'Mm, delicious!'
Mm, delicious.
- After I eat this? - Yes.
- Do you have a problem with that? - No. No problem at all.
The truth.
It's de...sgusting!
It's terrible, it's horrible.
- Do I get the part? - Next!
Ridiculous?
Ridiculous?!
What do you mean, 'ridiculous'?
Stupid yoghurt!
So, you didn't get it then?
- Nah. - Oh, I'm sorry, Nick.
Well, at least I don't have to eat them again.
Where's Hector?
Hector?
Don't talk to me about Hector.
So, where is she?
- Where is who? - Bridget.
I got her message and here I am.
- You have got a date with Bridget. - That's right.
This is a very, very strange day.
Bridget's not in.
- Here, have a yoghurt. - Thanks.
Handbag, handbag, handbag.
Eunice is an ugly, bad- tempered witch.
My handbag.
Oh, it's you.
Hello?
Who? Kevin?
Three years ago Kevin?
No, no, I don't!
Two old boyfriends - first John, now Kevin.
What a coincidence.
Mm, delicious.
Mm, it's de...sgusting!
Do I look fat in these trousers?
Yes.
What do you mean, 'ridiculous'?
Kevin?
What a coincidence.
Hello, Bridget.
How dare you call me a witch?
'You are an ugly bad- tempered witch.'
- I didn't send that message. - No? It's your number.
My mobile, someone took my mobile.
Good try.
The truth. Did you send that message?
No, no! Someone took my phone.
All right then, you didn't send the message.
So, what do you think of me?
The truth?
The truth, Eunice - you're an ugly, bad- tempered witch.
You know, Bridget, honesty is a great quality.
- It is? - It is.
I hope honesty will help you...
when you look for a new job! You're fired!
Well, hooray for the truth.
Ziggy's coming later. Then we'll decide who's the winner.
What a day!
I need comfort food.
The truth...the truth is, we were asking the wrong questions.
Ask me what I think of your eyes.
What do you think of my eyes?
I think you have the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen in my life.
Really? Tell me more.
I think you are the sweetest, kindest...
- Oh, snuggly puppy! - Oh, sugar plum!
I feel sick.
Hello?
Oh, not again!
Listen, Stuart, I finished with you because you have no personality,
no money...and no sense of humour.
More old boyfriends.
I don't understand it.
At last.
Oh, Bridget my fair
- Oh, Bridget my fair... - Stop, stop.
Stop!
Why are you doing this?
- But you told me to come. - I told you to come?
I got your text.
Who is sending all these messages from my mobile?
John? No, I don't want to see you! Goodbye.
So, where is she. I got her message and here I am.
..call me a witch? You're fired!
My bag? Handbag, handbag?
Eunice is an ugly bad- tempered witch!
Oh, it's you.
It was you, wasn't it?
I think Bridget should be the winner.
Yes, we'll pay for dinner for two at the Ivy.
Yes! I'm going to the Ivy!
Eunice?
So, what do you want?
'Please come to my flat at 7pm.'
Now, what do you want?
I didn't text you. Ziggy stole my phone and sent those messages.
Oh, lady of such beauty
- I have never seen... - Who's this?
Lady of such beauty You shall be my queen
Bridget, where did you find this man?
He is perfect for Channel 9.
He is?
Absolutely. He'll make a perfect weather man.
Maybe you can have your job back.
Now, come and talk about your contract.
Weird.
Oh, Bridget
She's a natural blonde
Her bottom is big
And she wears a thong
So, do I get a job too?
Next time in Extra -
Nick becomes a pilot,
Hector is his hostess
and why has Eunice come to stay?
and why has Eunice come to stay?
This is the story ofBridget andAnnie,
who share a flat in London,
and the boys next door - Nick, and his friend Hector from Argentina.
Bridget and Hector work for Channel 9.
Annie works for the environment
and Nick works as little as possible.
Stand by for Extra.
One for the party and one for the party hostess.
One for the party and one for the party...
accountant.
Hey, it's Builder Barbie!
Very funny.
Eunice wants some building work done
and guess who has to organise it.
Builder Barbie?
Hey, not for you, for the party.
We're having a party? What shall I wear?
It's a street party.
We're having a party in the street to protest and stop the cars.
Nice!
Hey, what's this?
Don't touch it. It belonged to my grandmother.
Your grandmother? It's lovely.
Yes. It's very special to me.
Well, what do you think?
Captain Chip Hardy, Pilot Extraordinaire.
Nick, is that you?
It can't be.
Women love uniforms.
Hey, hey, Builder Barbie and Pilot Ken!
But why are you dressed like a pilot?
I am in a play -
Chip Hardy, Pilot Extraordinaire -
for a theatre festival in Paris.
Now, who is going to help me rehearse?
Sorry, got to go.
Come on, you know you want to.
- Come fly with me. - What?
Oh, yes, Chip, I thought about you all the time.
- Nick, I really think... - Don't tell me, I feel it too -
something's not quite right.
I have got it.
Here. There. Beautiful. Now, I can fancy you.
Oh, no, Nick, please.
Did you miss me, sweet thing?
Oh, yes, Chip, I thought about you all the time.
When we get to Barbados...
Sorry.
But now, we have work to do.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain Chip Hardy speaking.
We will now go through the safety routine.
Exits are here, here and here.
In the event of cabin decompression,
place oxygen masks over your face, like so.
But please, attend to your own mask before helping children.
Life jackets can be found under your seat.
In case of forced landing, adopt the following position.
Eunice,
- I've got the builders on the phone. - About time.
Hello. You can start today?
Oh, Jean- Pierre, how nice to hear from you.
We really need the job done quickly.
We should meet tonight? Oh, yes.
Ah, yes, where to start?
Where? Mm, that's a very good question.
Where would you like the building work to start?
I was thinking...in my flat.
- In your flat? - Oh, yes. In my flat.
Hello? We want you to start work in Eunice's flat.
Yes, that's right, in Eunice's flat.
- It's 31 Evergreen Street. - It's 31 Evergreen Street.
That's right. Bye.
- Tea? Coffee? - No, no, no!
Make it musical, feel the words.
Tea! Or coffee!
Tea! Or coffee!
Thanks.
Hey, Nick, do women really go for you in that uniform?
Yeah.
But do they know that you are not a real pilot?
Well...
You tell them you are a real pilot?
Maybe.
Hello? Captain Chip Hardy speaking.
Oh, hi, Tiffany.
I love this uniform!
Yes, that's right, sweetie.
Currently flying at 20,000 feet, heading for Barbados.
Yes, that's right, darling, above the clouds, above the clouds.
Mayday, mayday...
No, no, no, we're just...
We're not being attacked, it's just a bit of turbulence.
Look, I've got to go. Bye- bye.
- Hi, Eunice. - Guess where this came from.
- DIY shop? - No. From my flat.
Ah, yes. Have the builders started? Excellent.
Excellent? Excellent?! My flat is a mess.
You told the builders to work in my flat?
Yes, you said.
But the builders were supposed to work at Channel 9.
Your mistake, you fix it.
- But you... - And until you do,
I'm going to stay in your flat.
We want you to start work in Eunice's flat.
Yes, that's right, in Eunice's flat.
Captain Chip Hardy, Pilot Extraordinaire.
I want to ride the pony!
Bridget, I want my breakfast now.
Of course.
- What would you like? - I want...
fresh coconut milk, two rashers of crisp bacon,
preserve of morello cherries - on French toast -
and coffee - Italian coffee.
Fresh coconut milk, Italian coffee?
- I don't have... - So, go out and buy them for me.
Horrible!
Captain Hardy, what are we going to do?
It will be OK.
I am too young to die.
- You have to save us. - Try to be calm.
But what about my family? What about my cat?
Pull yourself together, woman.
Excellent! You're really good. That was like...
Catherine Zeta- Jones.
You didn't have to slap me for real.
Sorry, but I...
Hello? Captain Chip Hardy speaking.
What?
It's the director.
What? What?!
Just a minute.
The actress? She's ill?
But we must still do the play.
No, we don't have much time.
Don't worry, I know the perfect person to play the part.
Oh, yes, the perfect person. Bye.
I...have an extra ticket for Paris.
- Do you want to come with me? - Paris?
- Oui, oui. - Excellente!
You call this a breakfast?
That's what I think of this.
And this.
And this.
And I have a little washing for you.
In the bedroom.
Now, what shall I eat?
You call this, 'a little washing?'
Be quiet and do it.
Hi. I got some polish for Granny's chest.
- Nice. - Oh, I love it so much.
It really reminds me of her.
Hey, you're eating my party food.
Yes, but...
it's not very good. Here, Charley boy!
Annie, Annie, please.
I don't want to lose my job. It's only for a few days.
Now, which of you lucky girls is going to cut my toenails?
I'm going to kill that woman!
No, no, let me.
Are you having fun with Eunice?
Why don't you stay here while we are away?
No, thank you.
Good luck in Paris.
Oh, Paris, c'est magnifique!
Hector, where were you? Our play starts soon.
OK, good luck.
Hector, there's something I've got to tell you.
Your play, it starts very soon.
Where is the actress who plays the stewardess?
Well, actually she's right here.
Good joke.
The actress, she's ill.
You are going to play the stewardess.
Look, there's your costume.
You are not serious?
You are serious.
Listen, Sylvia, I am going to fly this plane,
I will need all my crew. You are a professional.
I am your captain.
Will you fly with me?
No, no. No, no, no.
I am not doing it.
Sylvia, I'm proud of you.
Oh, shut up.
What's that?
- Come and have something to eat. - The shape looks familiar.
You've guessed.
It is that chest.
I did some work on it for you.
It looked so boring. I gave it a whole new look.
My grandmother's chest!
Annie, Annie, please.
Annie, Annie, please.
Where is the actress who plays the stewardess?
Well, she's ill.
You are going to play the stewardess.
Oh, shut up.
That was close! We nearly missed the plane.
Look at the reviews.
'Irresistible.'
'Dazzling.'
And that was just her legs.
'The hostess was beautiful...
in a masculine way.'
What's going on?
Ladies and gentlemen, we're experiencing some turbulence.
There's nothing to worry about except that the pilot and co- pilot are ill.
Does anybody know how to fly a plane?
Don't worry, I will fly this plane.
Nick, you cannot fly this plane.
I am Captain Chip Hardy.
I can do anything.
You are just an actor.
Captain Chip Hardy is your character.
But I have the heart of a pilot.
Tea? Coffee?
Wait a minute.
Hello?
Oh, really? Oh, excellent!
Goodbye.
Who was that?
The builders. Eunice's flat is finished!
Really?
Her flat is ready!
Our flat is ours again!
Hello, girls. Have you had a nice time?
What happened here?
Just a little party.
It was really fun.
OK, Eunice,
we've spoken to the builders.
Your flat's ready.
You can go home now.
I like it here.
I think I'm going to stay.
Where's my cocktail?
Bring my new wig.
- What do you mean? - What do I mean?
I am going to stay.
We are back!
Paris was great and...
Pilot Ken and Stewardess Barbie.
But he really is a pilot - he flew the plane!
Well, for a moment. Till the co- pilot punched me.
What happened here? A hurricane?
Yes, something like that.
Well, Nick, what's this? A new job?
Yes, sort of.
So, Mr Pilot, shall we have some fun?
Yeah, OK.
Will you take me flying?
OK.
Shall we stay here or go to my place?
Let's go to your place. This place is a mess!
Really, girls, you should tidy up a bit.
It is the uniform.
At last, she's gone!
I'm exhausted.
Well, if you are tired, can I offer you some tea or coffee?
Next time in Extra -
Bridget is interested in modern art,
Annie is fighting to free farm animals,
and who else is coming to dinner?
This is the story of Bridget and Annie, who share a flat in London,
and the boys next door, Nick, and his friend Hector from Argentina.
Bridget and Hector work for Channel 9.
Annie works for the environment.
And Nick works as little as possible.
Stand by for Extra.
It's Friday, it's seven o'clock.
Yes, it's time for an evening with Marty Ross.
And here's Marty!
Hi, darling, Marty Ross here. Let's spend this evening together.
Hi, darling, Marty Ross here. Let's spend this evening together.
Hi, darling, Marty Ross here. Let's spend this afternoon together.
Marty! Hi.
I was just writing notes for your show.
You like what you see?
Marty, you're so funny.
Is Lady Macbeth in?
- Who? - The dragon. Eunice.
No.
Marty, you're so funny.
Has Eunice got me tickets for Damian Pollasco's latest exhibition yet?
Who?
Damian Pollasco. The most important artist this century.
He's so raw,
so angry.
Of course he is. Silly me. I forgot.
Good old Damian.
Anyone who is anyone will be there tomorrow night.
So of course I must be there.
Yes.
So tell the dragon if there are no tickets, I will not present Saturday's show.
But you must, Marty. You're the star.
But if there are tickets, then I will take her out to dinner.
In fact, I'll take anyone out to dinner who gets me those tickets.
Anyway, must go. I've got fans to ignore.
Well? Carry on.
Hi, darling, Marty Ross here. Let's spend this evening together.
What a professional.
So if I get tickets for Damian Pollasco,
I get dinner with Marty Ross!
Who do I know? Who do I know?
I know! Dave! He's crazy about me.
Hi, Dave. It's Bridget.
I've got a little favour to ask you.
Is anybody home?
Annie, is that you?
Is that Ziggy? I think you should let her out.
No, it's OK. We're seeing what it's like to be a battery chicken.
A chicken that runs on batteries?
- No. - No!
A chicken that is kept in a small box to lay her eggs. Poor thing.
But isn't Ziggy a bit...
No. It makes it more real, doesn't it, Ziggy?
Tomorrow there is a big Farm Animal Freedom Protest in Trafalgar Square
and we will be demonstrating.
- Demonstrating what? - What it's like to be a farm animal.
Sounds exciting.
Boggy and Moss are coming from Manchester.
Boggy and Moss?
Boggy and Moss are very, very serious eco- warriors.
Eco- warriors?
They fight for the environment.
And you two will help us prepare.
Won't you, boys?
Bye.
Good old Dave. I knew he'd help me.
He just can't resist me.
Now...Marty.
Hi.
Hi, Marty. It's Gigi.
- Gigi? - Bridget.
- Bridget who? - Bridget. Eunice's researcher.
- Have we met? - Well, only about one hundred times.
Listen, I've got two preview tickets for Damian Pollasco.
Oh, that Bridget. How could I forget you?
How about meeting for drinks at your place first?
I'd...love to...
but it's just a simple loft- style apartment.
Well, I'm sure it's very arty.
I can tell a lot about a woman from her art.
They call me Arty Marty, you know.
And if I like your art, Bridget, maybe dinner afterwards?
Marty! What a surprise! I'd love to.
See you tomorrow, baby.
- Bye. - Ciao.
Dinner with Marty, dinner with Marty, dinner with Marty!
What shall I wear?
My flat! Arty?
Annie, look at this flat.
Sorry, Bridget.
Right, I've got 24 hours.
- I think you should let her out. - No, it's OK.
Boggy and Moss are very, very serious eco- warriors.
And you two will help us prepare.
I've got two preview tickets for Damian Pollasco.
They call me Arty Marty, you know.
And what is going on this time?
Hi, Bridget. I'm feeding Hector cornflakes.
Really? And why?
He's a turkey.
Yes, of course he is.
Turkeys are made to eat lots for Christmas.
Well, we all eat lots at Christmas.
No, it's cruel. It's to make them fat for humans to eat.
Let me guess. He is a baby cow?
Captain Chip Hardy, Pilot Extraordinaire.
We're preparing for our Farm Animal Freedom Protest.
No, you're not.
You're preparing this flat because Marty Ross is coming for drinks.
Not Marty Ross?
Hey, darling, let's spend the evening together.
Shut up, Nick. Go back to your bottle.
So this preparation, what is it?
I want this flat to look like the coolest art gallery in London.
The Tate Modern.
- The Tate Modern? - No furniture.
I want 21st century. I want art.
So how are you going to do this?
I'm not going to do it.
You are.
I must get my beauty sleep.
See you in the morning. Have fun.
Well, I'm not doing it.
Come on, Nick. It won't take long.
I'll give Ziggy the keys to your flat.
OK, let's get on with it.
There! That's better.
Marty will love it.
The things I do for Bridget's love life.
What about Bridget's love life?
Right, I'll be back with Marty at six o'clock,
so, Annie, I want nibbles...
- Nibbles? - Nuts, crisps.
Hector, you prepare the drinks.
And Nick...
try to be more interesting.
Now, don't let me down.
I want 21st century. I want art.
Yeah...
I'll show her interesting.
I'm taking the day off work today.
No, you're not. We've got lots to do before tonight.
Bridget's nibbles?
No! The Farm Animal Freedom Protest.
Boggy and Moss are coming here and I want you to look after them, Hector. OK?
Come on, Ziggy.
Interesting? I'll show you interesting, Bridget Evans.
Interesting, interesting!
No, too Picasso.
No, too sporty and stupid.
Yes! This is the one.
No.
Don't be ridiculous.
Nearly. Not quite.
Bingo!
Poor thing.
We're preparing for our Farm Animal Freedom Protest.
I want 21st century. I want art.
Hey, darling, let's spend the evening together.
Shut up, Nick. Go back to your bottle.
Oggy? Moth?
Excuse me, I am... Nuts...
Come in, come in.
Please...sit down.
So, you are Annie's friends?
I am Annie's boyfriend.
Would you like a drink?
You would? You wouldn't?
Tea? Coffee? Sugar?
It is my phone.
I know you know it is a phone,
but it is ringing, so I must...
Excuse me.
Annie, I'm so happy you rang.
Hector, I'm in the ladies' toilets in Trafalgar Square.
Have Boggy and Moss arrived yet?
Yes.
Annie, they are a bit...
Aren't they sweet?
Yes, very sweet.
It is just that they...
All right, chaps? Won't be a minute.
It is just that they are a bit scary.
Hector, don't be so silly.
Tell them to come to Trafalgar Square now.
Great.
You found something to eat. Good.
You like them?
Good, good, good.
Annie says you can go to Trafalgar Square. Now.
It is the phone again.
Phones ring, don't they? They...
Excuse me.
Hello.
Hello, Hector. Did you get the nibbles?
The nibbles. The nibbles.
Yes, of course, Bridget.
Well done, Hector. I knew I could rely on you.
That was Bridget, Annie's fr...
Now am I interesting?
Do I look that bad?
This is interesting!
What shall I do? It was Boggy and Moss.
Look, don't worry. We can tidy this up.
Look. See? Look.
Yeah, that looks much better.
- Still, at least I've brought the drinks. - And I have the nibbles.
- What? - The nibbles.
Very good.
Oh, no! Boggy and Moss ate them.
Look at this!
Tastes good.
See? Bridget won't even notice the mess.
Marty, you're so funny.
Anyway, here is my humble home.
Mr Ross, I'm a huge fan.
What is that?
It's a pigpen. We stole it from a farm lorry.
What a shame, no pig.
Boggy and Moss are bringing her later.
- This place... - This place is very...
I'm so angry!
..angry. I love it!
Yes. Yes, it's my angry art phase.
All my own ideas, you know.
- Cocktail? - Nibble?
And this is fantastic. Original?
Very original.
Very Damian Pollasco. I love art.
They call me Arty Marty, you know.
Is it...for sale?
The man's an idiot. He wants to buy a wall.
Much too expensive.
Much too precious.
Name your price.
Can you deliver them to me tomorrow?
Sure. No problem.
Nick, what's this cocktail called?
It's an Arty Marty.
It's rich, sickly and very thick.
Nick, your date is here.
Of course she is.
Next time in Extra...
Nick goes to the dentist.
Annie can't speak.
And why does an inspector call?
And why does an inspector call?
This is the story of Bridget and Annie, who share a flat in London,
and the boys next door, Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.
Annie cares about animals.
Hector cares about Annie.
Bridget mostly cares about herself.
But Nick doesn't care very much about anything.
Stand by for Extra.
Bridget Evans?
Annie Taylor?
Detective David Hunt of the Metropolitan Police.
Could I have a word with you, please?
So we went to the restaurant and it was a very good vegetarian restaurant,
and I had the peppers and Hector had the mushrooms,
which was very nice because Hector doesn't like mushrooms,
so I said to him that it was good for him to try.
Annie!
And then afterwards we went for a lovely walk
and it was such a beautiful evening
and the birds were singing...
Annie! Will you shut up?
Sorry.
You have been talking non- stop for 20 minutes.
I know. It's...
It's because I'm doing a sponsored silence for the charity Pigs With No Parents.
Sponsored...silence!
So why are you talking?
It doesn't start till ten o'clock, so if I talk a lot now, then I won't have to talk later.
Anyway, what's wrong with your mouth?
Nothing.
Have you got a spot? I'll call an ambulance!
No, but I am going to see my beautician later.
What for?
Just for a check- up.
A check- up? But you go to the dentist for a check- up, for your teeth.
Exactly. I'm going to the beautician's to check...
Check that you are beautiful?
Of course not. I don't have to check I'm beautiful, do I?
Hey, Nick! Do you like my new clothes?
Nick!
Nick! What is the matter?
You can tell me.
You have a toothache.
Then if you have a toothache, you must go to the den...
Can't I say the word 'den...'?
OK, I won't say the D- word.
I call him 'plumber'.
OK, so when did you last see the plumber?
That's not too bad, five months ago.
Five years ago?
When you were five years old?
It is going to be a big job!
He'll need a big drill.
Come on.
The girls must know a good plumber.
Come on.
Do you want a sweetie?
Do you want a sweetie?
Sweets are bad for your teeth. Come on.
Hi, sugar plum.
Hello, snuggly puppykins.
Nice clothes. New?
Yeah. Thanks.
Is Nick rehearsing for the pantomime?
No, he has a toothache so he must see the plumber.
No, no, no, Hector. For a toothache, he must see the dentist.
I know that, but Nick doesn't like the D- word.
'Dentist'.
So I'm calling the dentist a plumber.
So do you know a good plumber?
A plumber? What for?
Nick has toothache.
Well, he doesn't need a plumber. He needs a dentist.
Yes, Hector, we have the number of a very good plumber - Julian.
Julian!
He's so gentle.
He's so married!
Hi, Julian.
Listen, we have an emergency here.
What are the symptoms?
Shaking, squealing...
Yeah, just a toothache.
You can?
Thank you. Bye.
Sorted. He'll see Nick now.
OK, come on, Nick.
Come on. Come on, Nick.
Come on...
Come on, Nick.
Julian looked in my mouth once.
He said, 'Bridget, you've got wonderful teeth.'
With a mouth that big, I'm surprised he didn't fall in.
Hello.
Who's this?
Bernard?
Hello, Bernard.
Hello, Bernard.
You've been what?
Robbed?
When?
When you were in the bath?
All your clothes?
And your keys?
Poor Bernard.
Listen, you must call the police, OK?
OK. Bye.
Poor Bernard.
It's ten o'clock! My sponsored silence starts now.
He'll need a big drill.
If I talk a lot now, then I won't have to talk later.
Have you got a spot?
I'll call an ambulance!
All your clothes?
And your keys?
Bridget Evans?
Annie Taylor?
Detective David Hunt of the Metropolitan Police.
Could I have a word with you, please?
Why not?
You can't speak? I'm sorry.
You can speak.
Are you trying to be funny with me, young lady?
One word. Three syllables.
First syllable...
Sit.
Seat?
Chair?
Second syllable.
A? E?
I? I.
T.
Chair- I- T.
Chair- I- T?
You're being silent for charity!
But which charity?
Cow? Dog? Cat?
Pig?
Got it! Pigs Without Parents!
Is this man bothering you, Annie?
Because if he is, I am going to show him some Argentinian...
Detective David Hunt of the Metropolitan Police.
..respect.
- And you are? - Hector Romero.
I suspect you're not English?
He is a very good detective.
And you are?
Nwiff?
He's just been to see the plumber.
- The plumber? - Yes, he had a toothache.
But you don't go to the plumber when you've got a toothache.
- You go to the den... - Biscuit?
Dentist.
Anyway, I'm here to investigate a robbery
of Bernard Reynolds'...
Somebody has stolen Bernard!
There's been a robbery of Bernard Reynolds' clothes.
Who would want Bernard's clothes?
So I'm investigating everybody in the building
because someone has stolen Bernard Reynolds' clothes.
Where were you last night?
I was with Annie.
- Annie... - It's OK.
She can't speak for chair- I- T.
Anyway, what about Nwiff?
I...
Show me, Nick.
I went to Leo's Bar.
I had a beer.
There was a beautiful girl.
And a motorbike?
You were with a young woman on a motorbike?
Motorbike. Registration?
Name of young woman?
He wasn't with her.
The young woman was on television on a motorbike!
I saw that! Very nice!
Gee, I'm getting good at this.
Bridget Evans?
Annie Taylor?
Detective David Hunt of the Metropolitan Police.
Could I have a word with you, please?
Chair- I- T?
Got it! Pigs Without Parents!
What about Nwiff?
Motorbike. Registration?
Name of young woman?
There you are!
Hello, Mr Reynolds.
Well, have you caught them?
- Who? - The robbers.
The robbers who stole my clothes.
Yes. My investigations are going very well.
You have a cold, Bernard?
You need some clothes?
What a week! First, Mum went away to play bingo all weekend.
Bingo?
Two fat ladies, 88.
Clickety- click, 66.
Anyway, and then someone stole my clothes.
Bingo!
Digestives! My favourite.
You must be Miss Evans.
And this is Sherlock Holmes!
Bridget.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Bernard's wearing my dressing gown!
What are you staring at?
Nothing.
Is there something wrong with your top lip?
No.
Yes, there is. It's bright red.
It doesn't show, does it?
No, no, no.
They told me in the salon no one would notice.
Thank you.
I wanted perfect lips, but I didn't have enough money, so a student did them.
What, a butcher student?
There, there. You're still very pretty.
Am I? Really?
Really.
Where were you last night?
- Looking in the mirror. - All night?
Yes, all night.
How can anyone spend all night looking at themselves in the mirror?
Bridget would.
I think that someone here
is not telling the truth
and I think that someone is you.
But I told you. I was with Annie.
Annie hasn't said she was with you.
That's true.
She can't speak.
She is doing a sponsored silence for chair- I- T.
It doesn't matter. Did you go out at all?
- Yes. - Where?
- Shopping. - Shopping?
For what?
Some new clothes.
These new clothes?
Now, let me get this straight.
You need some new clothes and Mr Reynolds' clothes have been stolen.
So what does that tell me?
Yes, but I...
Why buy new clothes when you can steal somebody else's?
Yeah!
Do these look like Bernard's clothes?
They could be. My colour.
Oh, no! I spoke!
You! You made me speak!
Hello? Yes, he's here. I'll get him.
Bernard, it's your mother.
Hello, Mum. You're back.
How was bingo?
Mum, someone stole my clothes.
OK.
Right, I'm off.
Mum's back. She's cooking my tea.
Bernard, what about your clothes?
It's OK. She's got them.
- What? - What? What?
She put them in the washing machine before she went to bingo.
Mum!
So Bernard's clothes
were in the washing machine all the time.
Well, yes, as I suspected.
That's another case solved. I'll be off, then.
No, you won't!
What?
You owe me Â£120 for Pigs With No Parents.
You made me speak!
Well, will dollars do?
Next time in Extra...
The girls enter a game show.
And guess what Hector finds on his jumper.
And guess what Hector finds on his Jumper.
This is the story of Bridget and Annie, who share a flat in London,
and the boys next door, Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.
Hector and Annie love each other.
Nick loves babes and motorbikes
and Bridget loves make- up, mirrors and chocolate.
Stand by for Extra.
It's time for Can You Live Without...?
And here's someone you just can't live without.
It's Marty!
But what Sharon doesn't realise is we've got a camera in the bathroom.
That's disgusting.
She must know that we can see her.
I think it is quite clever.
And what are Paul and Mandy doing in the living room?
They're kissing. They're kissing.
They're not kissing. They're whispering.
What? Do you call this whispering?
Let's think of another name for it.
Paul and Mandy said they could live without kissing for 24 hours.
And look, they've failed.
Paul and Mandy lose points for that. We caught them kissing.
See you after the break.
Can You Live Without...? is sponsored by Clouds Toilet Tissue.
Well, I couldn't live without kissing Hector for 24 hours.
Why don't you try?
Hector, I wish you'd stop chewing gum.
- I'm not chewing. - Yes, you are. You're always chewing.
No...
I bet you couldn't stop chewing gum for 24 hours.
Well, yes, I could.
And, anyway, you suck your thumb.
I do not. Well, only when I'm stressed.
- I've had an idea! - Oh, no!
We could be contestants on Can You Live Without...?
We could do it. It's just 24 hours of giving up our favourite things.
It would be easy. Think of the prize money.
And Marty Ross presents it.
He would come to my apartment again.
- Oh, no! - Oh, Marty.
He's got such good taste.
And this is fantastic. Original.
What happened to Marty?
He said he needed time away from me to really appreciate me.
- So he dumped you, then. - He did not!
Anyway, Bridget, are you feeling persuasive?
Of course. I'm always feeling persuasive.
Well, it's time to persuade Marty
that we want to go on Can You Live Without...?
And then Marty can make it happen.
I'll try.
Mr Ross to Studio B, please.
- Hello, Marty. - Hello...
- Bridget! - Bridget?
Bridget, Eunice's researcher. We had dinner last month.
That Bridget. What do you want?
I've got something to say.
Well, I'm not the father.
- No! Nothing like that. - Well, what is it, then?
My friends and I want to be contestants on Can You Live Without...?
I wish I could help you, but it's not my decision, it's the producer's.
Now, I must go.
- You can't help me? That's a shame. - Yes, it is.
Because I'd hate for the newspapers to see this.
Or this.
Where did you get them?
Don't you remember? I'm Eunice's researcher.
I research.
I wish I could help you, but it's not my decision,
it's the newspapers'.
All right, all right. I'll see what I can do.
It's time to persuade Marty
that we want to go on Can You Live Without...?
Hector, I wish you'd stop chewing gum.
Because I'd hate for the newspapers to see this.
Or this.
We could do it. It's just 24 hours of giving up our favourite things.
It's time for Can You Live Without...?
And here's someone you just can't live without.
It's Marty!
Hello, darlings.
Do you want to spend the next 24 hours with me?
- Yeah! - Correct answer!
Yes, let's see what the people who live here...can live without.
But it looks like they live without anything anyway.
Well, let's meet the contestants.
You first, pretty lady. What's your name?
You already know my name, Marty.
We have a pretty joker here.
Don't get smart, sweetie.
This is my show, photo or no photo.
- Bridget. - Good luck, Bridget.
- And who do we have here? - Hello.
My name is Annie and I'm Hector's girlfriend...
and I love Charley, my dog.
So, which one could you live without?
Enough said!
And this is Hector.
So, Hector, Annie loves her dog more than you.
Mind you, Hector does sound like a dog's name, doesn't it?
Here, Hector! Here, boy!
Don't bite!
And, last of all and least of all...
it's...
Hello? Is anybody there?
I know, you're a fish.
Hi. I'm Nick.
Hi, Nick. And what do you like?
Bananas!
Baboons. You like baboons!
You are a baboon. You're a small baboon.
No, it's not baboons.
You like babes!
Sorry, this is Nick and he likes babes.
Well, let's get on with it.
As usual, each of these contestants has picked one thing
that their flatmates cannot live without for 24 hours.
Bridget...
You must live without chocolate... mirrors...and make- up.
Annie, you must live without...
touching Hector, sucking your thumb...
and, most of all, you must live without Charley.
Hector, you must live without...
touching Annie and chewing gum.
Nick, you must live without...
talking about babes or talking about motorbikes.
And all of you must live without
television, magazines and music.
24 hours of living without starts now.
Come on, Charley. You're coming with me.
Don't forget - I'll be watching.
No television!
No touching.
If you touch, we lose points and we won't win a big prize.
No make- up. What must I look like?
And no mirrors!
Look at that guy. He looks like a monkey at the zoo.
So how will they do? Top points could mean a holiday in the Caribbean.
But if they fail, they lose points
and their prize holiday could be this.
Of course, we might give them one or two temptations to make interesting television.
Join me after the break.
You must live without touching Hector.
Nick, you must live without talking about babes
or talking about motorbikes.
24 hours of living without starts now.
I think it's going to rain.
- Do you? - I agree.
Manchester United are doing well.
- Are they? - I agree.
I think it's going to rain.
Weather and football - is that all you can talk about?
Well, yesterday I met this really cute b...
Don't say it! Do not talk about babes or motorbikes.
Careful!
Bridget, no mirrors. You lose ten points.
But it's not a mirror, it's a kettle.
Don't argue! You lose another ten points.
Well, it's all quiet now.
What about some temptation?
Hector, what is in your mouth?
Nothing.
- Are you chewing gum, Hector? - No.
No, he's not. He's chewing this.
Open.
That was from the Red Sea. It cost a lot of money.
I could kill for some chocolate.
This should be fun!
'Bridget.
'I love the show, love from...
'Orlando Bloom.'
Orlando Bloom...watching me!
I hope you didn't hear me say that.
What do I look like? What do I look like?
What are you doing, Annie?
I'm talking to Charley.
Annie, you must live without Charley. You lose ten points.
What?
Hector...
- Don't move! - What is it?
It's OK, just don't move.
I'm not going anywhere.
What Hector doesn't know is that we've put that spider on his jumper.
This is wonderful TV
Think, think!
One minute.
That's better.
Now, we'll just brush this little fellow off.
Don't touch it!
It's OK. I'm sure it's not poisonous.
How do you know?
Anyway, if you touch me, we will lose points.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
OK.
Now...stay still.
Don't move!
Hang on a minute!
Hector, this is a toy.
I knew that.
Hector, you were so funny.
Marty has played a trick on us.
Yeah, very funny.
Who's a cross boy?
Things are getting really hot now
and they've still got over 12 hours to go.
You know, Hector, I really think we can do this.
We can win that holiday.
Hello, Annie.
Bridget, what are you doing in there?
I'm...just reading the electricity meter.
Come here.
Why are you wearing dark glasses?
I don't want Orlando to see me without make- up.
Bridget! Is that chocolate?
No.
But they're from Orlando!
No chocolate, Bridget. You lose 100 points.
Nick has entered the building!
Nick!
Yes! Annie and Hector touched. They lose 200 points.
- What? - It was an accident.
And best of all, Nick, you can't live without motorbikes.
So you lose 500 points.
No, no, no, no!
You said no talking about motorbikes, actually, big nose!
Yeah, Marty.
So thanks for the present. You can keep your holiday.
What? You can't do that.
Baby, fancy a ride?
Yeah!
Hector, this is for Marty.
Or should I say...Martina?
So, Marty, if you want the bike, come and get it.
Sorry, Marty, we can live without you.
Goodbye.
And, Marty, I think your audience will love this picture of you.
Oh, no!
Come on, Annie. We have lots of catching up to do.
Hector, catch me!
Next time in Extra...
Nick plays Santa while Hector and Annie play under the mistletoe.
Nick plays Santa while Hector and Annie plays under the mistletoe.
This is the story of Bridget and Annie, who share a flat in London,
and the boys next door, Nick, and his friend Hector fro Argentina.
Hector and Annie are in love.
Bridget likes to party and party.
And Nick will do anything to earn some money.
Stand by for Extra.
I love this time of year.
Sleigh bells, mince pies, presents under the tree!
What? Easter?
No, silly! Christmas!
I'm going to show you what a traditional English Christmas is like.
Starting with...mistletoe.
Mistle-toe?
It's an English tradition.
When you stand under it, you can kiss someone.
But I am not under any mistletoe.
You are now.
Oh, you poor things!
You're stuck together again.
Don't worry, I can help!
There, panic over!
- Right, I'm off. - What?
Another television party?
Not a party, three more parties.
And that's just tonight.
But you've been to a Christmas party every night for two weeks.
I know. It's so difficult being so popular.
First, there's a champagne party at the Savoy,
then at nine o'clock I'll get a taxi to the Ritz
and get changed on the way...
What? In the taxi?
Naturally.
And then at 11 :30 I'll get a taxi to Annabel's.
Annabel - who is she?
Annabel's - the night club.
Will you change your clothes in the taxi again?
And there I hope I Will meet a young, handsome man.
An early Christmas present!
I hate Christmas!
Did you have a bad day at the grotto, dear?
- Nick, is that snow? - No.
Well, what,s that on your beard then?
I was holding this baby...
when suddenly...
- Christmas! - But children Love Christmas.
- Is the money good? - Yeah.
Well, stop complaining then!
Hector and I are going to have a lovely Christmas, aren't we?
Christmas is all about parties and presents!
So, Bridget, have you got your Christmas stocking ready?
She's taking her stockings off in the taxi!
Don't wait up.
What is a Christmas stocking?
On Christmas Eve, you hang up your Christmas stocking
and a big, Jolly Father Christmas comes and fills it up with presents!
Who put that sleigh there?
My sleigh! I forgot!
Mind my leq.
Right, right... Whoa! Not too fast!
I feel terrible!
- Poor Bridget. Are you in pain? - No.
But what about the parties? I can,t go like this!
I could take you dancing!
Christmas is cancelled!
- Is that it? - Yeah, crackers are great!
So, what else do you have at Christmas?
Turkey, Christmas pudding, mince pies.
Mince pies. How do you make them?
It's just pastry and mincemeat.
- Mincemeat? - Yeah, it's traditional
It's sultanas, raisins and spices. It's mince...
- Meat. - Yeah.
Listen to this.
What do you get if you cross a chicken with a clock?
- I don't know. - An alarm cluck!
An alarm cluck!
I don't get it.
An alarm cluck!
One a cluck, two a cluck...
A clock?
Mistle-toe?
It's an English tradition.
When you stand under it, you can kiss someone.
I was holding this baby... when suddenly...
It's so difficult being so popular.
My sleigh! I forgot!
Mince pies!
First, the pastry!
And now the minced meat from the best butcher!
They smell good, don't they, Charley?
Well, I've finished all my Christmas shopping.
Oh, madam!
Refreshment? Mince pie?
Mince pies? Hector, you are clever.
I followed the re-ceep.
- Pee. - Mince pee?
No, no, no. Re-ci-pe.
Re-ci-pe.
Good choice, madam. Merry Christmas!
Something wrong?
Delicious...Delicious.
You know, Hector, Christmas is all about sharing.
Would you like some, Charley?
It's Saint Nicholas!
What happened to your beard?
One Christmas candle, one small child...
Mince pies, yummy!
With best mince from the best butcher.
Hector. What did you put in the pies?
Minced meat - from the best butcher.
This is mincemeat.
This is minced meat.
Isn't it the same thing?
- Not quite. - Delicious!
I've got an idea!
Let's make this a special Christmas, just for Bridget.
Night-night.
Hey, Bridget.
- Do you want to come carol singing? - Who is Carol?
Carols are Christmas songs.
You knock on people's doors and sing to them for money.
- Let's do it! - For charity!
For poor little children.
Some children have no Christmas.
Just like me.
And your job as Santa Claus is so important.
You help children to believe in Christmas!
Yes, you're right, Annie, I do.
My job is important!
I help children to believe!
Right, let's go!
I'll go, only if we can sing Abba songs.
And that Will make you happy?
Here, have a mince pie.
All right.
Away in a manger...
Dog in a manger more like! Good night!
Silent night...
I wish you were - all night!
We Three Kings of Orient are
One on a scooter, one in a car...
Get Iost!
Merrlly on high...
Get 'em, Gnasher!
Come all ye faithful
Joyful and tri...
Hi, Annie. I like the tree.
Thank you. It's nearly finished.
Please, use these. My decorations.
Oh, sweet, Hector.
- Are they from Argentina? - No.
Oxford Street.
- Aren't they great? - Great.
Hi, Nick. How was your Iast day as Santa Claus?
Great! Such nice children.
One of them let me play with his binoculars!
Really?
And I've just finished my Christmas shopping.
- But the shops are shut now. - No.
The petrol station was open.
Look I've bought my mum this.
A map of Watford.
- But your mum doesn't live in Watford. - I know.
She might go there one day, though.
I bought shampoo for my sister.
Car shampoo.
Yeah. And aftershave for my dad.
I like the tree...but I Love these!
I've got some too.
It was the Iast day of the grotto today, so they were throwing these away.
Can you believe it!
No!
Perfect.
Well, it might make Bridget Iaugh.
Why?
I know. If Bridget can't go to her parties, let's have a party here!
- When? - Oh, I don't know.
In about 15 minutes?
Look at the Christmas tree!
I know. It makes me want to cry too.
What's the point of having Christmas if I can't go to my Christmas parties?!
Now Christmas just makes me cry!
Bridget, cheer up.
Tomorrow is Christmas Day.
Have you got your stocking?
Yes.
And I've got mine!
What are you hoping for? A motorbike?
Yes! Why not?
The only thing that Will make this Christmas worse
is if you invited all my friends round for a surprise party to cheer me up.
Surprise!
And now the minced meat, from the best butcher!
They smell good, don't they, Charley?
We Three Kings of Orient are
One on a scooter, one in a car...
Good night!
Joyful and tri...
Surprise!
Hang on, I,m coming!
- Merry Christmas! - Hello, Bernard. Merry Christmas.
I'm sorry, we had a little party Iast night.
I'm here for dinner.
Isn't it a bit early?
Ten o'clock, time for a sherry.
- Bernard, where's your mother? - At church.
Well, I'll just go and get dressed.
To Bernard, Love from Annie.
Sherry. Thanks, Annie.
Nearly finished this one.
To Bridget, Love from Annie.
A flea collar? I haven,t got fleas!
I'm sorry, Bridget, wrong label. It was meant for Charley.
Is she sure it was meant for Charley?
To Bridget, from Hector.
Thank you, Hector. You shouldn't have.
What To Wear At Christmas Parties.
I bought it before you...
I've got a little something for you, Nick.
Gorilla - because you are the original man.
It smells like a gorilla.
Well, you should know.
I wonder what this could be.
Merry Christmas, sugar plum.
Merry Christmas, snuggly-puppykins.
One heart, forever.
This Will stop it!
Bridget, nothing Will stop my Love for Hector.
Well...
I just called to say Merry Christmas!
Hector.
Bridget, what has happened to you?
- I had an accident. - Oh, what a pity!
You've missed some fabulous parties -
especially at the Beckhams'.
Elton John is a very naughty boy!
Still, never mind, there is always next year.
OK, must dash.
Off to a top restaurant for lunch.
- Eunice? - Yes?
Before you go, have a mince pie. Nick?
I shouldn't...but it's Christmas.
It's true, there is a Santa!
And she's a woman! Wait for me!
I want to tell you what I really want for Christmas!
- Can you smell something? - Yeah.
Is something burning?
I forgot - the turkey!
Water, water! We need water!
Not on me! On the turkey!
Move! Move!
There. The fire is out.
Anyone for turkey?!
Shall we just have pudding?
No mince pies, thanks.
I have another surprise for you.
Another English Christmas tradition.
Chocolate log. One slice or two?
Next time in Extra...
Nick wants to join the SAS,
Bridget and Annie train the boys for action
and why is Hector home so late?
Hello, Hector!
Hello, Hector!
This is the story of Bridget and Annie, who share a flat in London,
and the boys next door, Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.
Hector works for Channel 9.
Annie is getting jealous.
Bridget has seen it all before.
And Nick just wants to have fun.
Stand by for Extra.
Hello, Nick. Have you lost a button?
Hi, Bridget.
I'm just...
practising.
Practising what?
I am going to join the SAS.
The Special Air Service?
- Yeah. - You?
What's so funny?
Nick, the SAS is for tough guys,
real men who are fit.
They're highly trained.
I was in the Scouts.
You...
were in the Scouts?
Annie.
Nick's going to join the SAS.
That's wonderful, Nick. Don't you need special training?
It's OK, he was in the Scouts.
Hello.
Here in the National Camping Exhibition...
There's Hector.
..it is all tents, tents, tents.
In every shape, size and colour.
And Eunice.
- And we will be showing you the best... - And the worst of camping.
So, stick around.
Back to studio.
Shall we go and try out some sleeping bags now, Hector?
Shall we go and try out some sleeping bags, Hector?
Calm down, Annie, it's only a television report.
I know but, well, he's been working with Eunice a lot recently.
And?
And, well, I'm just worried that he...
well, that she...
You know.
Annie, don't be silly. You've got nothing to worry about.
Although...
Hector is a good- looking man.
Yep, and she's a good- looking woman.
Incoming, Broad Sword calling Danny Boy,
Broad Sword calling Danny Boy...
I was watching that.
Not any more. Go on, it's late.
Back to your own tent.
What's so funny?
You.
A Scout.
Yeah, so?
I can just imagine.
Trying to light fires.
Jessop, you cheat.
Helping old ladies across the road.
Tying knots.
- What was that? - I didn't hear anything.
Hello, Hector.
Good evening, Annie.
Don't you mean 'good morning'?
Where have you been?
You know, for a couple of beers.
Who with?
With the lads.
So when did the lads start wearing ladies' perfume?
I forgot, Eunice was there too.
So what did you talk about?
Tents.
Tents?
You talked about tents all night?
Where? In her tent?
Or yours?
Annie. Annie...
I am going to join the SAS.
I was in the Scouts.
Shall we go and try out some sleeping bags now, Hector?
Where have you been?
When did the lads start wearing ladies' perfume?
Yes! I've got it!
It was my turn for the toy.
No, you've got the Incredible Hulk.
So I get two turns.
- Hey, Nick. - Yeah?
What do you think of Eunice?
Well, she isn't an English rose.
No, I don't think she is a flower.
No, it's a saying.
An English rose - a sweet, pretty girl.
- Like Annie. - No.
Eunice is not a sweet, pretty girl.
No. Eunice is more...
What is that plant that grows all over walls in England?
Honeysuckle.
Wallflower.
- Ivy? - Yeah, ivy.
Eunice is more like English ivy.
- What do you mean? - Well, she...
Likes dancing?
No, she...
She's all over you?
Do you like it?
I see trouble ahead.
What's so funny?
Come on.
Share the joke.
It's Hector.
Hector came home late last night, is that it?
He was out with Eunice.
Don't worry about Eunice.
She likes flirting, that's all.
This will cheer you up.
Look what I found.
It's pictures of us when we were Brownies.
- And you're wearing the Brownie uniform. - It still fits.
Look at all your badges.
What was the Brownie law?
A Brownie Guide thinks of others before herself...
And does a good turn every day.
Remember the Brownie law, Annie.
OK.
Hello, Hector. How are you?
Fine.
Did you have a good night's sleep?
What was left of it.
Dib- dib, dob- dob.
What's all this, then?
It is the Brownie salute.
That's not a salute.
This is a salute.
- What do you think, Hector? - Well, both salutes are nice.
- Brownies. - Or Scouts.
- Brownies. - Scouts.
What are you talking about?
What are Brownies? Biscuits?
When Bridget and I were little girls, we were Brownies.
We went camping, we sang songs.
We were given badges for good work.
Brownies are for girls.
In the Scouts we survived.
It was just like being in the SAS, wasn't it, Nick?
Yeah.
So what are all those badges for?
This one is for first aid.
And what is second aid or third aid?
First aid is for helping people who are hurt.
How hurt?
Like if they can't breathe.
Shall I demonstrate, Bridget?
Go ahead, Annie.
Lie down, please, Hector.
Now, this is called the kiss of life.
Sounds good.
It means I breathe into your mouth.
And if you still can't breathe, I do this.
Well, that is...
And I keep doing this until you can breathe.
Are you breathing yet?
Yes, yes, yes, I can breathe.
And that is my good turn for the day.
Now, Nick,
bites and stings.
No, thanks.
Of course, when I was in the Scouts,
I went camping.
So did we.
Ah, but this was proper camping, survival.
What? Like the SAS?
We had to live off the land.
What? No tins of baked beans?
No.
So could you do a survival test?
Yeah, no problem.
Yeah.
Right, then.
We will give you a survival test.
Great.
What is a survival test?
You'll see.
Just be prepared.
Ready for your survival test, boys?
- Certainly am. - OK. Test number one.
The jungle is full of horrible things that creep and crawl.
And some that wriggle everywhere.
Especially...
worms!
OK.
Test number two.
Food.
You have run out of food,
so you have to eat whatever you can find.
Open very wide, please.
Ready?
Beetles!
OK.
Test number three.
Pain.
I haven't touched you yet.
I'm sorry, boys, you have failed the survival test.
But in the jungle
it is going to be different.
Yeah, we were just pretending. It wasn't real.
What? Like real camping?
- Why don't we do it? - Do what?
- Let's go camping. - We haven't got a tent.
Well, Hector can get us a tent from the National Camping Exhibition.
Well, isn't tomorrow the last day of the exhibition?
Yeah.
And you and Eunice will be doing another report.
Yeah.
Well, then, you can buy a tent and come home early.
You'll miss your drinks after work.
Shame.
What do you think of Eunice?
I see trouble ahead.
Lie down, please, Hector.
That's not a salute.
This is a salute.
Ready for your survival test, boys?
Certainly am.
Worms.
Beetles!
Let's go camping.
In the jungle it is going to be different.
You will wake Annie.
Hey, I have an idea.
I must show you to Annie.
You know, I have a better idea.
Come, come.
Come. You too, come, come.
Nick.
Nick, wake up.
No more beetles!
- Hector. - Nick.
- What's going on? - I've got it.
- Got what? - The tent.
That's nice.
- Come on, let's put it up. - What?
The tent.
Hector.
- Have you seen the time? - No.
It's three o'clock in the morning!
- Is it? - Yeah.
Really?
Wait a minute.
Where have you been?
For a couple of beers.
And a dance.
What's that on your collar?
Paint.
Pink paint. That's nice.
When Annie wakes up,
she is going to be cross with me.
If she sees that on your collar, she will be.
Have you been dancing with Eunice?
Yes.
You are dead.
But...when Annie sees that I bought the tent...
she is going to forgive me.
At three o'clock in the morning?
Late- night shopping.
It is OK, Charley, it is me, Hector.
Where shall we put it?
Here.
Here.
In the middle.
Guy ropes.
What?
- Guy Ropes, who is he? - No.
Guy ropes.
Ropes called guy ropes.
Somewhere here.
- Look. - That's them.
Tie them to the furniture.
There. That is it.
Right, let's go to bed.
What? What's this?
Who put that there?
Hi, Annie. I've bought you a tent.
What is going on?
Well, do you like your tent?
Anyone for camping?
It's so cold.
I'll warm you up.
Did somebody say something?
I want a hot drink.
We can't even make a fire.
And there's no water left.
How long have we been here?
It feels like ages.
It's so creepy.
Yeah. Very creepy.
Are you tired, Hector? Did you have another late night with Eunice?
So who's going to go outside and get us some water?
Well, I won't.
Well, I won't either.
All right, I'll go,
but if I'm not back in ten minutes, you can have my Action Man collection.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Off you go.
Morning, Nick, dear.
Thought you and your friends would like a nice cup of tea.
Thanks, Mum.
Thanks, Mrs Jessop.
Next time in Extra...
Bridget gets a new job.
Hector receives a phone call from Lola.
And Annie is looking for trouble.
It's not Eunice. It's not Debbie.
Could it be Lola?
Could it be Lola?
This is the story of Bridget and Annie, who share a flat in London,
and the boys next door, Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.
Hector and Annie were in love,
but now things are not so good.
Bridget has given up on love,
And Nick - well, his mum loves him!
Stand by for Extra!
Hector.
- Yes? - Please could you pass the salt?
Yes.
Hector.
Yes?
Please could you pass the pepper?
Of course.
Hector.
Let me guess. Can I pass the sugar, coffee, tea?
Actually, I was going to say we should talk.
So, now you want to talk to me!
It's only been a week!
- I was hurt! - Well, you hurt me too.
- I didn't go out with Eunice! - I didn't go out with Eunice!
Yes, you did! And you stayed out till three o'clock in the morning!
There were other people there, too.
- Who? - People who work on the programme.
You mean other women who work on the programme.
Yes, and men - why not, huh?
I knew it!
So, who is she?
- Who? - The other woman.
There is no other woman!
Huh!
Annie, listen.
Excuse me.
Hello. Hi, Debbie.
How are you? Good.
OK, that'll be OK. Perfect! See you then.
Bye.
So, was that her?
- Who? - Debbie. The other woman!
That was Debbie from the make- up department, confirming my call time for tomorrow.
Some excuse!
- Hector. - Yes.
Please could you pass me your fork?
Here, I'm going.
You can have my dinner!
You should have seen Eunice's face!
She was furious!
When Eunice gets angry, she is a very scary lady!
Hello.
Yes.
Excuse me. No, no, to her...
Bye, Bridget.
All right, Hector. Bye.
Hola, Lola!
- Guess what? - Prince William wants to marry you?
I know that! No, I've got a promotion!
That's nice.
Nice? Nice!
It's fantastic! I am editor of Channel 9 Live!
Eunice is no longer my boss!
Is that Hugh Grant?
It's Bridget Evans here. Call me Gigi, editor of Channel 9 Live.
Are we still on for lunch at Claridge's today?
Fab! Ciao!
Eunice is so jealous!
Now, that is good news.
Annie, what are you doing?
I'm doing my own editing.
Why are you cutting up photos of you and Hector?
Because Hector is no longer my boyfriend.
Really?
Why?
Because he is having an affair!
Really?! Who with?
Well, I thought it was Eunice, but now I think it's Debbie.
Well, I just heard him on the phone to Lola.
Lola? Who's she?
Ha! Eunice, Debbie, Lola!
He's women mad!
It's fantastic!
I am editor of Channel 9 Live!
Hola, Lola!
I didn't go out with Eunice!
Yes, you did! And you stayed out till three o'clock in the morning!
So, was that her?
- Who? - Debbie. The other woman!
Hi, Nick.
What are you doing?
I am not doing, I am being.
What are you being?
- Can't you guess? - A man on the toilet?
A Sumo wrestler?
Can't you see? I am an egg.
Of course, you are an egg.
Now, what sort of egg am I?
Hard- boiled.
- Scrambled. - Scrambled?
- Fried. - Nearly!
Poached!
Yeah, of course. You are a poached egg.
Yeah.
Well, you're making a mess on your bed!
Anyway, why are you being a poached egg?
It's my new acting class.
Total Being.
What are you next week? A piece of wood?
- A piece of wood? - Yeah! Then it would be wooden acting!
Anyway, can poached eggs talk?
Don't be silly! Of course poached eggs can't talk.
No, no, I mean,
when you are 'being' a poached egg, can you talk?
Yeah.
Anyway, I want to stop now, my arms are hurting.
So, what do you want to talk about?
It is Annie.
She thinks I am having an affair.
- Who with? - Eunice.
- And Debbie. - What?
Two women, Hector!
You cheeky thing!
But I am not!
- So tell Annie then. - I have but she doesn't believe me.
- Why not? - I don't know.
Excuse me.
Hola, Lola.
I'll take this outside.
How are you, Lola?
So, it's not Eunice, it's not Debbie, could it be - Lola?
Stop, please!
I knew it!
It had to be a selfish man- driver!
Please, I have a voucher.
I- I am sorry, I've started, so I'll finish.
Look, I am Zeus, why are you so angry?
I'm not. I am just doing my job - Zeus!
People park on yellow lines and then are surprised when they get a parking ticket!
There was this one guy today - 'Please, I have a voucher.'
No excuse!
Mind you, he was quite cute.
Nick.
Nick, are you OK?
Bridget! Oh, it's you, Hector.
Well, there's something wrong with Nick.
- Well, I could have told you that! - No, he won't speak, he won't move.
I know. He is being a poached egg.
- A what? - For his new acting class.
Hi, Nick.
Let me guess.
You are being - a potato.
Do I look like a potato?
Yes. A couch potato!
What about a fish?
Yes, a frozen fish!
I am not a fish.
I...am...'Pain'.
You are a pain.
Yes, Nick is a pain!
No! I am 'Pain'.
Hurt, agony.
So, how was your first day as editor, Bridget?
What a day!
I had a very important meeting. Big decisions to make.
Like which celebrities, new programme ideas?
No, like which pen to use at my meeting?
Blue, black...
- Which one did you choose? - Blue.
Bad choice.
You think so? Oh, no!
Eunice is so jealous of Bridget's new job, she won't talk to anyone!
- Not even you? - Not even me! It is great!
You don't want her to talk to you?
- Really? - Really!
Oh, Annie, I hate it when we argue.
So do I.
- I miss you. - I miss...
Hola, Lola.
Right. Two can play that game.
I am not doing, I am being.
A man on the toilet?
Yeah!
I am not a fish! I...am...'Pain'.
It's not Eunice, it's not Debbie, could it be - Lola?
Hola, Lola!
Look, I am Zeus. Why are you so angry?
I am just doing my job - Zeus!
- Hello again. - Hello.
- We meet again. - You're happier today.
Yes, I am now!
But I'm sorry...
I parked here, so you would come back.
You wanted to see me again?
You are so beautiful!
Well, I'm sorry but I am going to have to give you...
- No... - This!
My phone number.
Call me.
Who needs Hector?
Hi, Bridget.
What 'oh'?
I know - Superman!
- What? - I mean, Clark Kent.
You are being Clark Kent, for your acting class.
No. I'm not.
I'm long- sighted.
You're being long- sighted?
No.
I am long- sighted.
I need to wear glasses for reading.
They suit you.
Thank you. So, why are you not at Channel 9 today?
I'm working from home today.
I've so much to do!
Bridget, what's the matter?
I can't do it! Eunice hates me!
Eunice hates everybody!
- They all hate me! - No, they don't!
- They all look at me! - Bridget, you are their boss.
I have to use the executive loo!
What's the matter with that?
I want to chat to all the girls!
Bridget...
you are one of the cleverest, most beautiful women I know.
Really?
- Well, who are the others? - What do you mean?
You said I was only one of the cleverest, most beautiful girls you know.
Bridget! You can do this job.
Channel 9 needs you.
- Thank you, Nick. - Hey, it was nothing.
You really look handsome in those glasses.
Hi, Annie.
Hi, Hector.
- You look smart. - Yes, I am going to meet someone.
Annie, I have something to tell you.
Sorry.
Lola!
Vale. Si, si, ya voy.
Hasta luego.
'Annie, I have something to tell you.'
That he is going on a date with Lola! That's what!
Nick, stop it! You're tickling me!
Hi, Annie. I didn't hear you come in.
Nick! Stop it!
Is everybody happy, apart from me?
Hello.
Zeus! Hi!
Well, of course I remember you!
A drink? Tonight?
Well, I'd love to.
Stop it! You're tickling me!
Zeus, meet my friends, Bridget and Nick.
- Hi. - Hi.
Well, hello, Zeus!
Annie, where did you find him?
Yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses, though, does he?
We've had a lovely evening, haven't we, Zeus?
Wonderful, Annie.
Now I must say goodnight.
Please, first may I use your bathroom?
- Certainly. - Thank you.
Zeus is such a gentle man.
He certainly is a man.
Hi.
Annie, I must talk to you.
What about? Your date with Lola?
My date with Lola?
Annie, Lola is a 60- year- old chief executive for ATV.
- What's ATV? - Argentinian Television.
And...
She wants me to return to Argentina to present their number one show.
But I don't want to go.
I want to stay here - with you.
That's better.
Hector, this is...
Zeus, my new boyfriend.
We've had a lovely evening, haven't we!
Come on, I'll say goodbye to you downstairs!
So, Hector, will you take the job?
What do you think I should do, Annie?
So we must say goodbye to our friends for now.
Will Hector stay, or go back to Argentina?
Will Annie go with him?
And will Nick ever give up on Bridget?
Extra - will the story continue?!
Extra - will the story continue?!
