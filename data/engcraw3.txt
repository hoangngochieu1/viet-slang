Once upon a time, fairy tales were awesome.
We know, you don't believe us.
You think fairy tales are cute and pink and full of fairies.
-Well, they're not.
-Real fairy tales are scary.
Follow two children as they venture off into a dark tale.
-A scary tale.
-A strange tale.
-A… Wait a minute.
Are you even old enough for this?
-You really think you can handle it?
You've been warned.
Don't blame me if you can't sleep tonight.
All right then, you're weird.
You might as well settle in.
It's time for A Tale Dark and Grimm.
I don't know. So far the story is not that awesome.
Come on, he hasn't even started yet.
Let's dive right in, shall we?
Once upon a time,
in the kingdom of Grimm, there were two children…
Hansel…
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
Gotcha!
…and Gretel.
You probably think you know their story.
I don't think you do. Not the real story.
-Never heard of them. -They lived with their mother, the Queen…
Story time.
…and their father, the King.
I'm the dragon!
Their parents loved them very much.
They were a happy, little family.
Until the dragon came.
I'll protect you.
Don't worry, it's only a story.
Which is why it was fairly surprising…
…when their father cut off their heads.
Whoa, whoa! You can't tell that part of the story, William.
There are kids out there.
I mean, look at that one over there. How old could you be? Seven?
How else is he gonna learn what's inside a person's neck?
It's mostly blood.
We're gonna show it.
Tastefully!
-What? Too soon?
You might think that this was the end of the tale of Hansel and Gretel.
-In fact, it was just the beginning. -Is this really going to work?
It will. It has to!
-And… done.
So, up and at 'em.
-Oh. -Here you go.
-Oh… -Gretel? Hansel? Please!
Oh, how could we ever have believed this would bring them back?
What have we done?
-What?
Children, you're…
awake!
So, who wants chocolate cake?
-I guess a slice would be--
No, thank you, Father.
-But Gretel…
We're very tired, and also we don't remember what happened just now,
in case you were wondering.
-I think we'll just go to bed. -I'm not tired.
-Good night. Love you guys. Sleep well.
-It worked. It really worked. -Do you think they noticed anything?
-Hurry, Hansel.
We have to get out of here.
-Why would they do that?
Don't they love us anymore?
You don't cut off the heads of things you love.
You do with flowers. We must have done something bad.
-Something really bad.
This isn't because of us. It's them. They're awful, evil!
Parents shouldn't slay their children. Not even once.
I-- I shouldn't even have to say that.
Hansel, we have to get out of here.
But where are we gonna go?
I don't know, but we'll figure it out, together.
Will it be an adventure?
-That I can promise.
And don't worry, I will always protect my little brother.
No.
-I'll protect you.
And I'm not your little brother. You're only two minutes older than me.
Almost three.
Do you trust me?
Let's do it.
-Adventure!
-Oh, no. -They're coming. Come! Quick!
Rug! Now!
-Come on.
-Ah! -What did you tie the other end to?
This… is going to be fine.
Who's that weirdo? Why is he wearing a cloak?
This is supposed to be…
-…mysterious.
Scared and confused, Hansel and Gretel made their way
through the quiet village.
Gretel, what are we gonna do?
Trust me.
I have a plan.
We are going to find better parents, perfect parents.
Like ones who won't kill us so much?
Exactly.
Okay, you know that woman who delivers bread to the castle?
The one who always gives us chocolate cake?
Mrs. Baker?
I was thinking she'd make a perfect new mother.
Yeah. Chocolate cake is like love.
Mom and Dad used to give us chocolate cake.
-Do you think they still loved us then? -I don't know, Hansel. Now, look…
Mrs. Baker lives right here.
Uh, what's this we have to go through?
It says, "deep dark woods."
Maybe we should go back home.
If we just knew why Mom and Dad did what they did, maybe--
Hansel, do you really want to get your head cut off again?
Just do what I do.
Take all your feelings and put them in a box.
-Lock and bury it and set fire to it. -What?
-Okay. -Never think about them again.
How can I set fire to the box after I buried it?
Hansel! We are going to find the perfect parents whatever it takes.
And then…
Mom and Dad will be sorry.
Let's go. Stay close.
And so Hansel and Gretel made their way
through the deep dark woods
-to find the perfect family.
One of us.
Who's there?
I'm armed!
-Ah! -One of us.
D-did you hear that?
It's-- It's just the wind.
Wait!
They're in my hair! Get them off me!
Shoo! Get out of here.
Gross. One of them kissed me!
Okay, we have to find somewhere we can rest for the night.
It's too dark to go on.
-Look. It's glowing.
This is crazy!
Sewing someone's head back on should not bring them back to life.
It's some kind of magic thread.
Modern medicine is amazing.
Gretel, I have a bad feeling about this place.
Just a thought, instead of resting, we could keep walking forever and ever
and please, please not stop in the deep dark woods.
-No. We need rest.
And Hansel, I know you can keep me safe.
-Okay, I can do this.
All I've gotta do is keep my eyes wide open…
…all night long.
One of us.
Wolves.
Gretel? Gretel?
Would you rather die awake or in your sleep?
Why would you ask?
In my sleep.
Too late!
-Stay back! Stay back!
Take this!
I'm sorry I got us into this!
If I have to die again, I'm glad it's with you.
Wait, did that sound like I'm glad you're dying?
I wasn't paying attention!
Stay away! I'm warning you!
-Run!
That way!
We gotta get across.
I can't do it! I can't do it!
-You have to. Take my hand!
-Come on!
-Help me!
-Oh no.
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. -Ah!
Bad day to be a wolf.
-Hmm.
-Wow! -You two all right?
Those wolves will take a piece of you if you give 'em half a chance.
Here. You must be freezin'.
-Thank you. -Thanks.
Sir? We're looking for a Mrs. Baker.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, her cottage is a day's walk that way.
You can't miss it.
Uh, are you two kids alone?
I'm only asking 'cause you look like you need a place to stay.
We've got plenty of room on the farm for the both of you
and plenty of turnips.
Hansel, a turnip farmer.
Or a cake baker.
We have a winner.
-No, thank you, sir. -But we appreciate your help.
Oh, that's too bad.
We'll be there, if you change your minds.
Thanks. Bye.
See ya.
Hansel and Gretel continued on
unaware that they were being followed by
-him.
A day later, Hansel and Gretel emerged from the forest
exhausted and hungrier than they had ever been in their lives.
You want some turnip sack? The sweaty part is salty and good.
Hansel, are you seeing what I'm seeing?
-Is that… a cake-house?
I'm going to find out.
With my mouth!
-Mmm. Mmm.
Children!
-Oh, I just love…
-…children!
-Try the fence, my widdle sugar-puffs.
-It's peppermint candy cane!
Thank you, ma'am. I'm sorry we screamed.
-We thought you were gonna chop us up. -Hansel!
Chop you up? Why?
I love children.
-They're so… sweet.
Oh, give me a break.
I know we're doing a "Is she nice or is she evil?" thing,
but come on!
Everyone knows this story.
She's a witch who eats children.
What's wrong with that? Children are so sweet and juicy.
She's not a witch.
She is a perfectly ordinary woman
who eats children.
You see, once she had a child of her own.
And she did what parents so often do…
…look at you, you are so sweet.
But she took it just a little bit farther.
I could just eat you right up, yes, I could.
-Ooh, oh, I could… just eat you up.
Thus, her beloved child became several rather delicious pies.
And once you've developed a taste for children…
…it's a hard habit to give up.
Come in, sweet ones. Come, come, come.
Stay for dinner.
-Stay as long as you like.
Stay forever.
Sit.
Let me bring you a little snack. You must be hungry.
What brings you to my little cottage, my sweethearts?
Our parents chopped our heads off.
-Really? How inconsiderate. Ha!
We're looking for the perfect family. Or at least one that won't kill us.
And will let us eat chocolate cake whenever we want.
And never make us do chores.
Well, I have some… …cake for you now!
And just about everything you could ever desire.
How's that for a happily ever after?
Ma'am, may we eat like animals?
You do you, baby.
Hansel and Gretel had found something to replace their parents' love:
food.
-Really just a lot of food.
-Eat up. -Mmm.
This. That. Some of this. Some of that. Eat my sweets.
Mmm. Yeah.
She must really love us, right?
Yeah.
Remember when Mom and Dad played hide-and-seek with us?
Do you think they still loved us then?
I don't know, Hansel.
We have Mrs. Baker now.
Everything is fine.
Here you go, my sugar plums.
Eat those pies up…
Oh, look at my sweepy widdle muffins.
Come, I have a lovely room ready for you
with great, soft beds.
Good night, sleep tight.
Don't let the bed bugs bite.
Not until you're…
ripe.
We did it, Hansel.
-We found the perfect family.
And she's so pretty.
I love her so much.
How come is the closet full of children's shoes?
Eh… Kids are always losing things.
That one has a foot in it.
-A little foot leg.
Don't worry about it.
It's fine.
My plan worked perfect and everything's fine.
If you say so.
Good night.
Wakey wakey.
-Foody-oot. Food, food.
-Yay! -Food!
-Mmm. Yes. Eat up, little piggies, eat up!
Those ham hocks ain't gonna fatten themselves.
Digesting so much food took a lot of energy.
After a while this left very little energy for Hansel and Gretel's brains.
That was when Mrs. Baker decided…
-…they were ripe.
Oh, Hansel.
Is that you, food?
I need your help in the kitchen, honey pie.
-Okay.
-There's food there, right? -Uh-huh. Yeah.
Be a lamb and get in the oven
and tell me when it's hot enough to bake you and your sister, will you?
-There's a widdle boofy-woops.
How will I know when it's hot enough?
You'll die.
-Hey. -Yes?
If I'm dead, how will I tell you it's hot enough?
I'll smell you cooking.
M'kay.
-Whew, boy, whew.
Wow. Something smells delicious.
It's me that smells delicious.
Oh, it's just you, pocket pork chop.
Wait a second.
Dying is bad!
No! Hot, hot, hot, hot!
How are you doing in there, my widdle dumpwing?
Uh-- Uh, just fine. Nearly done now.
I don't smell you yet!
Hansel hardly had any brainpower left.
But he had just enough to trick Mrs. Baker
into opening the oven door.
There it is.
My dear little piggie.
-Heads up! Ha! Get baked!
No! No!
-You ungrateful little swine!
-Gretel, wake up! We have to go!
Food?
-She tried to cook me! We have to go! -Wait. What's going on?
Oven… doors… don't… lock!
Sweeties!
Hansel?
Hansel!
Do you really want to know when your parents stopped loving you?
The answer is quite simple.
Obvious, really.
They never loved you. Never. Never. Never.
You know it's true.
Eat this!
-Um, maybe she's okay?
-Uh… -Maybe she's okay.
Oh, she is not okay.
Mmm. Candy canes never looked so good.
Would you please just…
Forget it.
Can we just check in on the children who are watching this right now?
Are you guys all okay out there?
How about that little kid? You.
You're still here?
A woman just got impaled on a peppermint stick.
Why would he not leave?
I give up.
I like that kid.
And so Hansel and Gretel got far away from that place as quickly as they could.
It's true, isn't it? Mom and Dad never loved us.
But that means we did the right thing. We just didn't pick the right parent.
That's the reason my plan didn't work.
-We need someone more down to earth.
Like that farmer!
Nothing's more down to earth than turnips.
We can do this. We can find a better family.
A perfect family. Are you with me?
We're never going back.
It's you and me forever.
-Hello.
We meet again.
Unfortunately.
Two children were here,
two unusual children.
They are mine.
Oh, you can have them, for now.
That's not what I'm here for.
Oh, yes, you should carry on.
Ta-ta.
Have a fantabulous trip.
Um, hello? H-- Hello?
So, wait.
-What's going on here?
Nothing good.
Me? Wait, no. But I'm-- But I'm not ripe yet.
No. But you are done.
Nailed it.
Under a sunny sky,
Hansel and Gretel arrived at the turnip farm.
That farmer seemed like a no-nonsense guy.
I'm sure he'll be completely normal.
Not weird at all.
Hello, children.
This is fine.
Once upon a time, fairy tales were awesome.
We know, you don't believe us.
You think fairy tales are cute and pink and full of fairies.
-Well, they're not.
-Real fairy tales are scary.
Follow two children as they venture off into a dark tale.
-A scary tale.
-A strange tale.
-A… Wait a minute.
Are you even old enough for this?
-You really think you can handle it?
Once upon a time, a young girl and a young boy
were looking for the perfect family,
and they found Mr. and Mrs. Bauer.
-Hello, children. -Hello.
-So happy to see you.
-Come, let's go inside.
Okay, that guy definitely has a suitcase full of human heads somewhere.
Yeah, I like him too.
Nonetheless, Hansel and Gretel sat down with the Bauers
and told them their whole crazy story.
And that's our whole crazy story.
Yeah, crazy!
The Bauers reacted… as anyone would.
I don't know if you can tell,
but we are definitely not staring at you two like you're nuts.
No, no, no, not one bit.
-What's wrong with your face?
Hansel!
I'm glad you asked.
You see, Mr. Bauer has feelings, like everyone.
But sometimes he has trouble showing them, you know, with his face.
So sometimes I paint on a nice happy smile.
See? So cheerful.
Is he gonna lay an egg?
Kids, let me just lay my cards on the table.
Mrs. Bauer and I have always wanted a daughter.
-Uh, and you seem good too.
So, the two of you are welcome in our home.
Thank you.
We'll do whatever it takes to be perfect children and make this the perfect family.
Fantastic.
I'll fix your supper and we'll ready a nice warm bath for you both.
-A warm bath?
This is going to be the perfect home.
And we'll live happily ever after!
I know that Baker lady didn't work out so good.
-Because she tried to eat us? -Yeah. There was that.
But I'm going to make it up to you now. Don't these two seem great?
He can't smile so she paints smiles on him.
Don't be so judgy. It's fine.
Gretel. I'm practically grown up now, and I have a bad feeling about this.
You can't tie your own shoes.
Yeah, that's why I said "practically."
Well, my good thinking beats your bad feeling.
And you can keep me safe by helping me make this the perfect family.
By being a good kid.
By making our new turnip mom and turnip dad happy.
Yummy turnips.
-This isn't good. -Ahem.
Hansel and Gretel set out to be the perfect kids in their new perfect home.
Well, Gretel did. Hansel was just, eh, Hansel.
-Here's breakfast.
Diced turnips, poached turnips in a turnip béchamel,
and hash browns.
That are also turnips. Enjoy.
Thank you.
-May I call you Mother?
Of course you can, dear.
Because you are…
…my children.
-Mother? -It's not breakfast without eggs.
-It smells like feet. -Shh, shh. Thank you for the food, Mother.
-We are grateful to be your children.
Blech! Not good at all.
I'm sure you'll grow to like it.
-Good job, Gretel.
But try throwing your shoulder into it. Like this.
-Got it.
-There you go.
-Hansel, knock it off!
-I'm sorry. Are you mad?
No, no. That's how I laugh.
This keeps getting more and more not good.
Come on, it's fun. Try it.
Despite his bad feelings, as the weeks went by,
Hansel started to become part of the family.
Thank you.
Okay, everyone, smile…
for seven or eight hours.
We also want two eight-by-tens and six wallet-sized.
More like 16 hours.
You were right. I am starting to like this.
Told you everything would be perfect.
Yes, they were all quite happy together.
-But of course, it couldn't last.
-Seven beds?
-We don't go in that room.
Just when Hansel had grown to like this place,
all his bad feelings came creeping back.
-How come that room has seven beds?
No reason. Seven's my lucky number.
It's a guest room. What beds? I was never here.
What? Sometimes people back out of rooms laughing.
-But she-- -Don't mess this up, Hansel, please.
Gretel refused to admit that anything was wrong.
But she couldn't ignore the Bauers' strange behavior.
-Hansel! No!
I have to protect you. What if it's a bridge troll?
That's the first thing you think of? Bridge troll?
-Where is there even a bridge?
Quick! Hide!
Let's find out what else is under that trapdoor.
What's this?
It's okay, I landed on my face.
That's their terrible secret. They've been hiding toys!
Hansel. They obviously had children before us, seven boys.
-But what happened to them?
Do you think they chopped their heads off? Or ate them?
Or maybe they just died from too many turnips.
I think you should…
I can't keep this up any longer.
We mustn't tell 'em.
-They'd be gutted.
-They can't ever know… -But she--
…we wanted a daughter so much we never saw what we had.
If Gretel hadn't shown up here, we would still have our seven boys.
It's true.
And our boys wouldn't have turned into swallows.
Gretel? Gretel?
Gretel!
Hey, it's okay.
No, it isn't.
But I'm going to make it okay.
I can fix this. I can fix this.
Maybe we could just find another family somewhere else?
No. I'll find those swallow boys and bring them back.
Then everything will be fine, and we can be one big happy family.
Tell the Bauers I'll be back.
Wait.
-You think you're going alone?
Ugh! Okay, when are you gonna tell us who this weirdo is?
-Not just yet. -Right.
Because parents are so thrilled about a creepy man following two kids around.
We're busy.
Hey, birds, it's me, your adopted brother. Come back!
Those weren't even swallows.
You gotta stop doing that every time you see birds.
Look, birds!
-It's me, your adopted brother!
Someone must have seen them.
If only there were someone who could see the whole kingdom.
Like the sun?
-Worth a try.
And so, Hansel and Gretel climbed the tallest tree they could find,
-so they could talk to the sun. -Ah!
And they discovered that the sun is exactly how you'd expect her to be: hot.
Hello, children!
Oh, I am so glad to have visitors. It is so lonely up here.
Oh! The moon won't talk to me.
-I borrowed his dictionary and lost it-- -Stop talking.
-You're killing us. -Ooh, okay, I didn't lose it. I burned it.
-We're leaving now! -Oh, wait. Please, no, don't go. Please!
-I'm so lonely! -Go, go, go!
I don't know. Try the moon?
Yeah.
-So… um…
…hi, moon.
Hey, guys. Nice night, isn't it?
-Have you ever been eaten?
Oh, no, wait, guys. That came out wrong.
-What? No! -Don't tense up! Go limp!
Ooh, not that limp.
I'm so sorry.
Gretel, are you feeling okay?
I'm fine.
That's not what your face says.
Look at these pictures.
The Bauers were happier before us.
They were right. This is my fault.
-How could it be your fault? -I don't know, everything's my fault!
Look at all the stuff that's happened since I made us leave home.
Maybe I'm cursed or something.
I would've seen if you got cursed.
There would've been a witch or the Devil doing spooky hand stuff.
It's me! I'm the problem!
-Gretel!
I ruined everything.
What tears have awakened us?
It's us.
The stars.
What? Didn't you know that the stars talk to you when you cry on their reflections?
Boy, public education
-has really gone downhill.
I think this snake is dead.
Hello, stars. I'm Gretel.
-What's going on? -Shh.
I really need some help.
We can help you. We see everything.
Uh, but not my alone bathroom time, right?
We know you seek the seven swallows.
They came to us, and asked us to help them hide somewhere.
Far away from their cares.
Their cares? Did they mean… me?
-It is possible.
They said a girl came, and they were turned into swallows.
So it was my fault.
I have to fix this. Tell me where they are. Please!
We sent them to our secret citadel high atop the Crystal Mountain.
It has a hidden door, and to find it
one must solve this riddle:
though I am dark, I die by night.
I come again with morning light.
A giraffe. No, a-- a scorpion.
No, no, don't tell me, uh, two giraffes.
Oh my. You are very bad at riddles.
Three giraffes.
Once you have solved the riddle,
you will need this rare and magical key to open the door.
-Uh… It looks like a chicken bone.
It is a chicken bone.
That doesn't make any sense.
We know.
Magic is weird.
Why would the swallows want someone to help them hide from you?
Because I wrecked their lives.
But I'm gonna fix it.
I'm gonna walk all the way to Crystal Mountain, answer a riddle,
and open a door with a chicken bone.
-I can't let you go alone. Let's do this!
-Oh, that way's bad.
-That way's bad too!
That way's okay, but the rabbit looked at me funny!
It's this way, Hansel.
Hansel and Gretel set out on a daring quest to find the seven swallows,
journeying bravely across treacherous landscapes.
They ventured through blazing deserts.
They ventured through muck-filled swamps!
They ventured through Lollipop Meadow!
-No!
The longer they journeyed, the more Gretel's guilt consumed her.
-I will fix this.
Turnip mother will be happy. Turnip father will learn to smile.
We will be perfect.
Gretel, are you feeling okay?
Am I feeling?
Hansel, it's time you learned something.
Feelings are stupid. All they do is cause pain.
I'm done with them! I don't have any feelings!
That's a weird thing to yell angrily.
Wait up!
As time passed, Hansel's courage grew.
Don't even start with me, rabbit.
And Gretel's guilt turned her cold.
Gretel, did you see that? I am the king of the forest.
Yeah, don't pick at it and it'll be okay. Let's keep moving.
Finally, after many months of travel,
they arrived at the foot of Crystal Mountain…
…taller and stronger than ever before.
Let's go get us some swallows and make our turnip parents happy.
Exactly.
Now I know what you're thinking. "Yay, they made it, I feel all warm inside."
Well, don't.
And, parents, you need to know this is about to get inappropriate.
You might want to blindfold your kids.
Or peck out their eyes. Just go peck, peck, peck! It's so easy!
Wow!
This is the most beautiful place I've ever seen.
There's no door.
The riddle!
Right. You must have been working on it this whole time.
You'd think so, right?
-Um, how did that riddle go again?
It's a good thing I wrote it down.
"Though I am dark, I die by night. I come again with morning light."
Four giraffes.
The sun comes in the morning, but it isn't dark.
Night is dark, but it goes away in the morning.
Hey, that rock looks like a giraffe.
-Told you it'd be a giraffe.
-A shadow.
It's a shadow!
-Yes!
Time for the chicken bone.
-The chicken bone!
Oh, no, no, no, no!
A hole? No!
-Here, uh, let me look.
It's not here.
The bone is gone. I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
I hurt you and I hurt everyone.
Open!
-Open… these doors! -Gretel, stop it!
-Please!
What are you doing?
-Whatever it takes. -Stop!
Stop right there! You can't show this next part.
-I mean, it's too horrible. -Show it!
It's not your job to stop the story. We're telling the story--
-Someone's gotta protect these children. -Mama wants some gore!
We're not going to see details, Jacob. I'm not an idiot.
You see, gentle viewer, while Gretel didn't have a chicken bone,
she had another bone of around the same size.
A bone of her very own.
-Yes, Gretel used her own finger as a key.
I know what you're thinking, and you're right, cutting off your finger
is a terribly foolish thing to do,
but we have to tell the story just as it happened.
This is crazy.
I still don't get why her finger would open the door.
And why would she have to chop it off for it to work?
It doesn't make any sense.
I don't know. Maybe the important part was the sacrifice.
I…
…bring news from your parents.
They'd like you to come back home.
Please. You have to come home with us.
I'm the girl who showed up and caused all of this.
-Please!
Let me try.
Hello, my bird brothers.
-I have something for you.
This was yours, wasn't it?
We found your father crying over this toy.
He really misses you all.
More than you can imagine.
He misses us?
Deeply. They both do.
I'm so sorry for what I did to you.
What?
-No. You didn't do anything.
But… What are you saying?
Right after you came to our house,
our father told us to go to the well to get some water.
Your new sister will want a bath,
so fill that tub to the top.
-And no horsing around!
But, well, we didn't listen.
-Oh boy.
-You're useless. Useless!
I wish you'd all just turn into swallows and fly away!
Fly away!
You see, this happened when you showed up.
-But it wasn't your fault. -Huh.
-It wasn't my fault?
It wasn't my fault.
All that time,
all those months of travel.
Everything I put Hansel through…
-I kinda had fun, though. -I cut my finger off!
I said I had fun.
All this just because Mr. Bauer lost his temper?
Pretty weird, right? So, are you coming back home with us?
No! Never!
There are no perfect parents! There's just pain.
Pain and suffering and blood!
Okay.
Well, um, we're just gonna take off, then.
We can find our own way home. Nice meeting you.
Good luck with your suffering.
And blood.
We never said it when we were in there,
-but we all missed our mom and dad.
I want you to have this.
Thank you.
Bye!
-What do we do now, Hansel?
Everything I think is wrong. I failed you.
No, I'm the one who failed you.
I should have protected you from our parents,
from Mrs. Baker lady, from the Bauers.
And now look what happened to your finger.
Who's gonna take care of us?
No one.
There's no one to love us.
I love you, Gretel.
And I love you, Hansel.
Do we even need parents?
You're right.
I've had it wrong this whole time.
We don't need parents.
-All we need is each other.
Gretel, I won't let anything hurt you ever again.
Come on, let's find someplace to make a new home.
-Someplace warm. -Watch your step.
I heard about this one guy Jack
who fell down a hill like this and broke his crown.
And so they ventured down the mountain toward a tiny patch of green,
where they could live happily ever after.
Like that's gonna happen.
Hey, if you thought this chapter was gruesome,
don't stick around for the next one.
It's gonna be… Ugh.
It's just so nasty.
I am psyched for this next chapter.
Are we gonna see guts? 'Cause I feel like we're gonna see guts!
Morning, Dad.
I have that bad stomach thing again.
-Could I have the day off school, please? -Fuck's sake.
Oh my God.
God.
What's up with you?
I don't think apples are good for my stomach acid or something.
Why do you eat them, then?
Well, it's Tracy's idea. Instead of cigs. I'm getting through like six a day.
Ew, the full bushel.
-What's a bushel? -It's like the It's a
-It's kind of what you carry them in-- -Stop. Forget it.
Okay. Don't ask me, then.
-Do you wanna hear this? -Go on.
Morning, Dad. Um
I have that bad stomach thing again.
-This guy. -What time is it? 6:00 a.m., that.
Commitment. Don't wanna go, does he?
Yeah, he knows Tracy will say no, and I'm the soft touch.
-What are you gonna reply? -Well, she'll sort it. He'll go.
"Know thyself."
-Disgusting. Fucking disgusting. Vile. -I'm so sorry.
- Ugh, I can really smell that. - Sorry.

I will arrest you for obstruction. Please stop. Please.
I'm arresting you on suspicion of murder.
You don't have to say anything, but it may harm your defense if you

-Do you understand? -Dad!

- Eddie! - Please. What's going on?
-Stop it. -Listen. I'm explaining to your wife.
Your son, he's been arrested on suspicion of murder.
- He couldn't! - We've taken him to the station.
You can follow. On Heywood Street.
-Know where that is? -I do. Round the corner.
You might be entitled to compensation for mess we've caused you.
-Fill this in. -You've bashed the bleeding door in.
- Fill it in. - Why do you need guns for a 13-year-old?
- He's 13! - Understand what I've said?
Of course. Do you understand? There's no way he's done this.
-We'll see you there. -He's had guns in his face and everything!
- I hope youse are happy with yourselves. - Dad!
- He's a kid! He's my son! - No!
- It's all right. Don't worry, son. - Dad!

This is Bravo Delta 5-0.
Yeah. Go ahead, Bravo Delta 5-0.
Yeah, 10-95. All okay and cooperative, okay?
Understood.
I want my dad.
Jamie.
Jamie, I know it's hard, but you need to calm down, okay?
- Just calm yourself down, mate. - I want Dad here.
I haven't done anything. I haven't--
- Hey. - I've not done nothing.
We'll get into that when we get to the station, okay?
This is not the place to be speaking about anything like that, all right?
Save all of this for when we get there. Don't say another word.
I'm gonna suggest something. When asked, you ask for a solicitor, okay?
And you can speak to your parents about it when you get to the station.
- Mm-hmm. - It won't make you seem more guilty.
It's just for your best interests, all right?
Jamie, this is Derek.
Derek will be your appropriate adult for the purpose of this arrest, all right?
Hi, Jamie.
I'm from Doncaster Social Services, all right?
The custody sergeant is gonna ask you
whether you want to keep Derek on, or whether you want someone else.
You can even have one of your parents.
It'll just be for your searches, bloods,
any time you're talking to your solicitor, that sort of thing, okay?
It won't prejudice your case, whatever you decide, mate. All right?
I
Okay, Jamie.
- I don't even know-- - Hey. That's enough.
-That's enough. -Just wait.
It's for your own benefit. Okay?
Let's go.
Custody desk.
-Yeah, D.I. Bascombe. One in custody. -Okay.
Inside, please.
Okay. Just stand there.
- Ah, thank you. - You all right?
Just over there on that stop mark, Jamie. Let's go, please.
Sarge, this is Jamie Miller.
He's 13 years old. He's been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Okay, Jamie. Can I have your full name, please, son?
- I didn't do it. - That's not to do with me.
Just try and answer my questions, please, son.
It's Jamie Edward Miller.
And have you had your rights explained to you, Jamie?
What?
Did the officer explain that you don't need to speak,
but anything you do say may be given in evidence? Yeah?
- Yeah. - Okay.
And will you be wanting a solicitor?
- Yeah. - Okay.
And do you have a solicitor, or do you want the station to provide one?
I don't know. I don't think so. Can you ask my dad, please?
Yeah. So because you're a juvenile,
you need to be supported by an appropriate adult.
Now, would you like that to be one of your parents?
-Or would you like that to be Derek? -I'd like my dad, please.
You sure? You can have a think.
I want my dad, please.
Okay. Next business, son. Are you fit and well?
What?
Are you currently taking any medication for anything, Jamie?
No.
Okay. And have you got any long-term medical conditions,
such as asthma or any kind of serious allergies?
No.
Okay. And have you ever tried to take your own life or self-harmed?
No.
- Have you had your breakfast, son? - No.
Okay. I am, at 6:31, authorizing your detention
so that the officers can preserve evidence by questioning you
about the offense you are suspected of.
You can be held at this police station for 24 hours.
Your detention here will be reviewed
by an independent inspector on a regular basis,
so that you, your solicitor, or your appropriate adult
can make representations about your detention at that review.
Have you understood all that, son?
- Yeah. - Okay. Good lad.
Right, let's get you to a cell.
It'll just be you in there. Then we can fetch you some breakfast.
I think we've got some cornflakes. Is that okay, Jamie?
You okay? We're here now.
- We're here. - We're here.
Can Can I go to them?
Jamie, we need to process you here, okay?
The sooner we do this, the sooner we can bring your dad in.
All right, lad? Are cornflakes all right for you, Jamie?
Just pay attention, Jamie. You're doing well, son.
This bit's nearly over now. You're doing really well.
Cornflakes are okay?
- Yeah. - Okay.
Once you've had your breakfast, Jamie, a nurse will be brought in,
then if she thinks you're okay,
you'll be taken to have some photos and samples taken, okay?
Then your lawyer'll be brought to you. All right, son?
- Yeah. - Okay. Good lad.
Right, P.C. Grogan. It's cell number six, please.
Right. Okay, if you want to just follow me.
You'd better open this fucking door!
Denzel! Fucking It's you or me!
You fucking with me?!
Okay, then, Jamie.
This is what we call a dry cell.
If you need the toilet, you're gonna have to ask. All right?
Okay.
Fucking course you are!
Stop looking at me! Shut up! Let's have ya!
All right?
Takes a while to review things before we can do anything.
Yeah, but you only have about four hours
Thing is, imagine if--
-I know, love. -Mr. and Mrs. Miller, how's it going?
Brilliant, yeah.
Look, I understand this must be a hard time for you.
I've got a few questions I need to ask if that's okay.
Um, well, Jamie has asked for a solicitor. Is there a family one that you guys have?
-No. Not at all, no. -No.
Okay, well, we can provide one.
Um, we have a duty solicitor here that we can call.
- What, is that one of yours, is it, yeah? - They don't work for us.
It's their duty to protect your son's best interests, but
It's a service that we have here free of charge if asked for.
Yeah, but free normally means no good, though, don't it?
Mr. Miller, look, I completely understand your concerns,
but in my experience, they're very competent solicitors,
so it's up to you.
- Okay. - Yeah.
- Okay. - Thank you.
- You all right, Mrs. Miller? - No.
How can you behave like that and come here and behave like this?
How does that work, eh?
Your men threw me on the floor, threw my daughter on the floor.
-I'm okay. -I hope they didn't do that.
I hope they told you to get on the floor for your safety and for theirs.
And if they didn't,
you are well within your rights to make a complaint, okay?
-Would you like me to get someone? -That is what they did, Mum.
- Okay. - Okay.
All right?
Last thing, um we do have someone suitable
if you're unable to do it, but Jamie has asked
whether you'll be his, um, appropriate adult.
What's that?
You'll be in his interviews with him, any bloods taken by the nurse.
That sort of stuff.
-How do you feel about that? -Okay, yeah. Yeah, all right.
Why did he pick you?
- He's not good with needles. He won't-- - Okay. He'll be fine.
- It's all right. - He'll be fine.
Mr. Miller, I have to say this.
If your son has admitted to you anything regarding this case
or any of the events leading up to this case, you can't do this job.
- He hasn't said anything. - It could jeopardize his case, okay?
And I told you, you've got it wrong, mate. He hasn't done anything.
He's said nothing to us. He's done nothing.
Okay.
All right, look, um, there's a coffee machine there.
Nurse is gonna be a while, all right?
Someone will come through and see you soon.
It's drinkable. Help yourself.
- I'll see you soon. - Thank you.
- Do you want a coffee, love? - No, thanks.
Well, don't be letting everyone know what's happening.
We haven't even got a clue ourselves yet, love.
I'm texting Susie to make sure our house is okay.
We haven't got a door anymore, if you remember.
Yeah, look, maybe maybe you should go home, eh?
Yeah, you should.
Well, what would I do there? I'm not I'm not going. I'm not. I'm not
Well, tell her not to clean anything up, okay?
Tell her to take loads of photos so we can fill that form thing in.
Okay, good idea.
Mum, what's gonna happen?
It's all right, love. It's just a mistake.
You see it on the telly all the time. It's just a mistake.
She said they were charging him with murder.
- Well, he hasn't done anything. - Of course he hasn't.
-He can't have. Of course he hasn't. -They've made a mistake.
Of course they have. Yeah. Yeah. We know he has.
Ah, excuse me, love. Excuse me. You were at our house, weren't you?
-Yeah. -Can you tell me when we can see me son?
Not long, Mr. Miller, all right?
-Morning, Sarge. -All right?
- Yeah, you? - Yeah.
- Morning, Carol. - Morning.
- You all right. - Yeah. All right?
Hi, guys.
-Morning, everyone. -Morning.
Ooh, fucking hell, how much do you want a cigarette right now?
- Don't start me off, mate. - Fuck.
Have you had anything from upstairs yet?
Ah, just comms, wanting to know what to release and when.
- Nothing from the DCI. - Mm-hmm.
You worried about the dad?
- The dad? - Mm.
No, I'm not worried about the dad. Why? What are you saying?
I don't know.
I had this old case once, right?
Young boy.
Put it this way.
It took us months before we realized what the dad was doing to him, so
- I don't see it. I don't. - No, you're right.
You're right.
God.
Forensics. What are we saying? What have we got?
Do you think they'll have an answer already?
They should have been through a chunk of the house. Shoes? Possible weapon?
I'll check in with them.
What about Bruntwood? They sent over the files?
I don't think anyone's been in the school yet. It's early, innit?
- Can we get into his phone? - Nope, it's locked.
- Can we ask him for a code? - Not till after assessment.
- And she's late. Yeah. - She is, yeah.
- You wanna go through the plan again? - I mean, we could.
- But honestly, I think we're good, mate. - All right. I get it.
- Go and have a nap. - I'm going to have a walk. See you later.
-Sir, I'm just going through the PER form. -Okay.
Post charges, he's underage, so the council are gonna have to decide
which accommodation they can move him to.
Oh, hello. Nice of you to join us.
Are you fucking joking me? Do you know what time it is? Knob.
- Evan, I don't know what you're asking me. - I'm asking for a risk assessment.
He's been accused of murdering someone with a kitchen knife.
So where are we gonna put him?
Cross that bridge when we come to it, won't we? Yeah?
- Yeah, okay. Yeah, sound. - Okay, cool.
Oh God.
Yeah. Good time or bad time?
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry, I know it's early.
Shower, yeah? Okay.
Anyway, did Adam go in?
I mean, is he going in?
Mm. Keeps on texting me.
And I told Misha he only texts me 'cause he knows I'm the soft touch.
Yeah, she sure did.
Anyway, I just just thought I'd call and say hi.
Yeah, I'm all right.
Listen, I'd better go, all right?
You too. I'll see you later. Bye.
- Sir. - Good, good.
Yeah.
Allergic to penicillin
-Sorry. -That's all right. Thank you.
Sorry. Cheers.
Okay, Jamie, just a few more questions, then, if that's okay.
Can you explain to me what being under arrest means?
It means being here.
Can you have another go at that?
Answer the question, lad.
It means the police think I've done something.
They'll have me locked up until they know whether I have.
That's a good answer.
And can you explain why you might need a lawyer?
So so I don't get trapped saying the wrong thing.
Also a good answer.
Okay, Jamie, well, I think you're a bright boy.
I don't see a vulnerability the police need to be aware of.
Have you got any questions for me?
No, I I don't think so.
Is that a bad thing?
No, you're fine. I'll give you a minute.
- Ta. - Okay.
Eat your cornies, son.
I don't want 'em.
Come on, eat the cornflakes. You need to eat something.
I haven't I haven't done anything. I just
I just wanna I just wanna go home. I've not done anything.
Do you believe me that I've that I've not done anything?
Of course I believe you.
You're my son, aren't ya?
Hey?
Sorry, Mr. Miller.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave if that's okay.
Sorry.
- Eat your cornflakes. - Yeah.
Eat your cornies, son. You need to keep your strength up, yeah?
Mr. Miller, I'll take you back to the family room.
Dad!
How long are we gonna be here, mate?
I can't answer any questions now, unfortunately.
Any idea?
Mate
He's a bright boy, you know.
Right. No current medication. No relevant medical history.
- I hate juvenile cases, me. - No one likes 'em.
Morning, Sergeant.
- Morning. - Jamie Miller.
Ah, right, okay.
Parents are in the family room, and the lad's in the cell,
so I'm guessing parents first, yeah?
- Yes. - Know where you're going?
- Yes, I do. - Okay.
- Morning. Mind buzzing me through? - Yeah, of course.
- There you are. - Thank you.
- I see you on the phone. - Sorry to disturb. Mr. and Mrs. Miller?
Um, my name's Paul Barlow. I'm from Storey and French.
-I've been allocated Jamie's case. -All right.
-Um -Can you tell us what's going on?
Yeah, do you wanna take a seat, and we'll run through a few things.
So, the way this works is, um,
I'll be briefed by the arresting officers as to the particulars of the case,
and I'll also catch up with what's been going on
since Jamie's arrest, okay?
Do you have any complaints as to your treatment so far?
Yeah. They tore the house apart.
They had guns and everything. They smashed the door in.
-Okay. -Wrecked the house.
When a violent death's taken place, that's the name of the game.
The question is, whether or not that was proportionate.
We'll look at that later.
Okay, but more importantly, how's Jamie doing?
He's he asked me to be his thing. What was it called?
Appropriate adult.
-Appropriate adult. -Yeah, it's good.
It's generally better he has a parent in there with him.
You can keep him calm while we work this out.
He's, uh
I've just seen him.
To be honest with you, he's not looking too good.
Right. I don't blame him. Neither would I.
Um, to be honest, there's not much I can say right now
that will make this situation any better.
Um, I can see the shock that's happened here,
and it's totally understandable.
But we'll do our best here for you, okay?
I'm gonna get myself briefed, if you can hang tight for me.
Someone will be along with you shortly, okay? Okay.
- Thank you. - No.
Cheers, mate.
- Of course. - Thank you.
It's all right.
- Sorry. - It's all right. All right.
Thanks again.
-Am I -Should be all the way down.
- Is it the usual room? Yeah. - Yes.
-After you. -Thanking you.
Good morning.
-Good morning. -Paul.
- For you. - Thank you.
Okay. So, what have we got?
Incident took place at 10:13 p.m. last night.
Arrest approximately 25 minutes ago.
Well, that's my personal record broken, then.
- Heard you made a mess of the house. - Yeah, sorry about that.
Okay. Murder. So I'm assuming you're going after possession and threatening as well?
Yep.
- Can I know anything about the victim? - You will do.
Okay.
Is it a media blackout, is it? Because I couldn't see anything--
We're still looking for the relatives, their dad.
Okay. Okay.
-Has he been told his right to silence? -Yes.
-Is he clear on what that means? -Yes.
-Has he been fed? -He's had the opportunity to eat.
- Assessed? - Yep, she passed him fit.
- Searched? - Waited for you.
-Good to hear. I see you're taking blood. -Yeah, scratches on his arm.
Blood at the scene. It's not without justification.
- Wasn't questioning that. - Okay.
And what investigation has taken place otherwise?
- Nothing with the suspect. - Anything else I need to know?
Nothing that we're gonna tell you now.
- Where was the victim pronounced? - At the scene.
Multiple wounds. It's in there.
And his father's his appropriate adult?
Correct.
-Is he okay? -Think so.
-And how's Jamie around him? -Don't know.
Fine.
- Ready for samples. - Sarge.
-Is that all I'm getting? -Yep. That's all you're gonna get.
Okay. Samples first, but then a chat.
-I wanna have a look at this kid first. -Paul, don't be so excited.
- I'm not excited. - Makes you look like a prick.
- Uh, D.I. Bascombe, one last thing. - What?
-I just need two minutes. -Go on.
Sir, we've got a teacher here from Bruntwood Academy.
-I'll be up. -I'll be so quick.
-Well, follow me. -All right.
Can I have Mr. Miller, please?
Hi, sir. We need you in the medical suite.
Just while your son has some samples taken, please.
Right. Um, I'll I'll be as quick as I can.
Okay. Watch him with the needles, Eddie.
-Please. -Just follow me, sir.
Just wait in here, please, Mr. Miller. Your son will be with you shortly.
- I'll leave you to it. - Yeah.
- It's warm, innit? - Really warm.
-Want me to hang your jacket? -You're all right. Thank you.
P.C. Grogan'll be in here, and your dad as well. Okay?
Hello, Jamie.
So, what's gonna happen now, we're gonna take some photos,
then we're gonna take some samples, then we're gonna search you, okay?
- Okay. Okay. - Okay.
Let's get you over on this chair here,
facing that camera on the wall just to take some photos.
So there'll be a bit of a flash, all right?
Lovely. And to the side.
And the other side.
Lovely. And that's done.
Jamie, very quickly. My name's, uh, Paul Barlow.
I'm from a solicitor firm called Storey and French.
- I'll be advising you today, okay? - Okay.
Um, we'll talk, but I didn't want you wondering
who this strange man was, all right?
Jamie, can I just get you to stand here for me?
I'm just gonna do a quick mouth swab, if that's okay.
- Yeah. - Sorry. Let me close the door.
Just open wide for me.
And the other side.
Okay, my love.
All right. Let's get you over here, shall we, for some fingerprints.
So just get you to get your right thumb.
Press on there. There'll be a red light that'll come on.
Thank you. And your index finger.
Lovely. And your middle finger.
Lovely. And your ring finger.
That's right. It's that one there, yeah.
Thank you. And your little finger.
Thank you. Okay. And let's do your other hand. So left thumb.
That's it. Thank you.
Index finger.
Yep.
And your middle finger.
Thank you. And your ring finger.
There we are. Thank you.
And then your little finger. Last one, though.
Lovely. Thank you.
Okay, then.
So now, Jamie, we need your passcode
just so we can access your phone, if that's okay?
Uh, there's no need to give them that, Jamie.
No.
No.
Okay. Erica.
Yeah, Jamie, do you want to just hop on the bed for me?
I'm just gonna take some bloods, if that's okay.
-I I don't really like needles. -He's no good with needles, love.
Jamie, I've got to warn you, it may harm your defense if you refuse.
Yeah, he's right.
Do you consent to your son giving a specimen, Mr. Miller?
Are you gonna be okay?
I don't know.
You'll be fine. It won't take long. I promise. Be as quick as possible.
-Okay. -Yeah?
Yeah, just look at me, lad, yeah?
-Look at your dad. Pop yourself here. -Yeah, just keep looking at me.
- Gonna put this around your arm. - All right.
You're just gonna feel a bit of a squeeze.
Is it Is it gonna
Keep looking at your dad. Nice and still for me.
You're just gonna feel a sharp scratch, okay?
-Look at me. -Keep looking at your dad.
Come on. It's all right.
- Nearly there. - It's all right.
Nearly there. Keep looking at your dad.
Oh, is it done? Ow.
- Yeah. - There you go.
- There we are. - Good lad. See?
- Brilliant. - Okay.
Keep your finger on that for me just for a couple of minutes.
-Sound. -Well done.
Well done. There you go. Sorted.
Okay, then.
I'm gonna have to ask you to take your clothes off.
- What, all of 'em? - I need to conduct a strip search.
- Is that necessary? - Afraid so.
I'm not too sure about this, mate.
There is a chance that he may have concealed things on or around his body.
Look, he he wet himself earlier on,
so he's changed his undies and his pants and--
I understand, Mr. Miller.
-No, he changed his jeans and everything. -Mr. Miller, I understand.
But this is a serious offense.
Okay, I've got scratch marks on his left arm.
We need to make sure there's no other cuts or bruises we need to be aware of.
I think this is a bit serious as well, don't you?
How would you have felt if you were 13 and had two men looking at your bits?
- I wasn't accused of a crime. - That's it, mate. Accused .
He hasn't been found guilty. He's been accused.
- Can you not do anything about this? - I'm sorry.
They're entitled to under PACE.
Mr. Miller, I promise I will be very careful.
I don't know you from Adam, mate.
- We need to cooperate with this. - You know? That's my boy, and he's 13.
- Like I said, he's 13. - Mr. Miller.
- Passcodes, we can tell them no - It's procedure, Mr. Miller.
- He's 13. - This is for Jamie's defense.
Dad, it's fine.
- You okay? - I don't mind.
So, Jamie, I'll just get you to pop your clothes off for me.
So I need to observe,
and then P.C. Grogan's just going to observe me, all right?
Do you want to pop your clothes on the side there, yeah?
Do you want to turn to face me? All right?
And just lift your arms up for me.
There we are.
You can turn to the side.
Mm. And then face the wall behind you.
Okay.
You can pop your arms down now.
You can turn back to face me one more time.
Okay, and if I can just ask you to lift up your penis.
I need to make sure that there's no defensive wounds on your scrotum.
No. Okay.
All right, then. And that's done.
So gonna ask you to pop these clothes on for me.
And then we'll pop yours just in this bag here.
- Thank you. - What are they for? What are you gonna do?
They'll be used as evidence, Mr. Miller.
- You okay? You all right? - Yeah.
Yeah? You sure? Okay, good lad.
Are we finished in here?
Can I get a room to speak to my client, please?
-Yeah, sure. Next door. Follow me. -Thank you.
- Thank you. - Of course. Yeah. No problem.
- There's chairs. - Thank you.
Jamie, want to pop yourself on the other side of that table?
Dad can sit next to you.
That's the worst part of that over and done with, I'm glad to say.
I thought you handled it extremely well, Jamie.
What's your favorite subject in school, Jamie?
-Why does that matter? -Uh, just humor me.
-History. -Why?
Uh, I like the stories.
And, um, what's your favorite bit of history?
Um, we're doing the Industrial Revolution.
Oh, are you? All right, okay. Um
Who do you like who took part in the Industrial Revolution?
Uh, you know you know Brunel?
Yes. Yes, I do.
-I like him. -Why?
Because he he did stuff no one else did.
Boats, trains, everything. He just did it.
Yeah, he did.
Smart kid.
Um, I'm not here
to ask you whether or not you did or didn't do it, Jamie.
-I didn't. -He didn't. There's no way he did it.
My job, and your dad's job,
is to protect you whatever happened last night, okay?
And the police, they're trying to find out what happened,
but they're not here to protect you.
They believe you're guilty of something, and that's why we're here, all right?
So all I want you to do is say, "No comment."
All right? That's it. Just, "No comment."
Mm, to everything?
Uh, no, not to everything. That won't go down well.
Uh, just to questions about the events of last night.
All right? Do you think you can decipher between questions you should answer
and questions you shouldn't answer?
Mm, I don't I dunno.
Is your name Jamie?
Yeah.
And where were you last night, Jamie?
-No comment. -That's it. That's it.
Whenever you're unsure,
whenever it's 50-50, just say, "No comment."
And if I think you should answer the question, I'll advise you so.
But you're a very bright lad, and I think you'll do absolutely fine.
Um, I'll be in there. Your dad'll be in there.
I won't be afraid to speak upon your behalf.
And your dad can also speak up whenever he chooses.
-All right? -Can I?
Oh, yeah. Of course you can, yeah. Yeah.
I I I haven't done anything wrong.
Well, that makes it easy then, doesn't it?
Right, I'm gonna I'll be back in a second. Um
I'm just gonna see how they're getting on, setting up for this interview.
If you could sit tight. Try to be patient for me.
I'll be back for you. All right?
Just wait here a minute, lad. Just give me a sec.
- Excuse me, mate. - Yeah?
Look, I haven't got a clue what I'm doing here.
I don't What do I say?
Just um, don't answer for him, all right?
Uh just uh, just be yourself.
They know you're his dad. We know you're his dad.
It's it's okay to process.
It's okay to be shocked, and it's okay to be human.
- All right? - Yeah, I mean, this isn't normal.
-Do you know what I mean? -No.
-I've never even been in a police station. -You'll be fine.
I just don't want to get it wrong for me lad. Do you know what I mean?
You'll be fine.
I'm shitting myself.
-I understand. -He's a he's a good kid, yeah?
And I'm I'm a good dad. Do you know what I mean?
He really is. Look, you said yourself. You even said he was bright.
-Yeah, I did. -So do you understand?
I can see that, but
Here we are now, and we've this to deal with, okay?
And I think the police have some pretty compelling evidence.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have been able
to ask for blood, to make the entrance that they did.
Now, I don't know what that evidence is,
but I'm pretty sure it's gonna become clear to us very soon. Okay?
So, um, the best thing for you to do is to raise that chin up,
be the good dad,
and, uh, suck it up, okay?
Yeah.
They're shaping up for the interview. I need a minute just to have a look.
Can you sit with him? You all right doing that?
I'll be back for you shortly.
Okay.
-All right. -You'll be fine.
-Okay. -All right.
I'll be outside if you need me.
You okay?
Yeah.
Look at me.
Look at me.
I'm gonna ask you once. Okay?
And no matter what's happened, no matter what you have or haven't done,
I want you to tell me the truth.
Did you do it?
No.
Promise?
I promise.
Good. Okay.
Okay, then.
Everything's gonna be all right, then, isn't it? Hey?
Yeah.
- Okay, they're ready. - Yeah, okay. So are we.
- It's okay, Jamie. - Ready?
Come on. Come on. You're all right. Let's go.
Um, you okay?
Just before we go in, Jamie, just to go over what we said again.
If you're unsure, just look to me, remember that "no comment,"
and, um, your dad'll be by your side all the way through it, all right?
Okay? Okay.
- Hiya. Come on through. - Hello again.
Hey, Jamie. We'll have you sit down there.
Your dad can sit next to you.
Paul, you can pull up that seat over there.
Yeah.
To let everyone know, this interview will be recorded, audio and video.
- Is that okay, Jamie? - Yeah.
Okay. I'm gonna start the recording now.
Okay.
First of all, I'm gonna start with reminding you of your rights, Jamie.
I want you to listen carefully.
You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defense
if you do not mention when questioned something you later rely on in court.
Anything you do say may be given in evidence. Okay?
Yeah.
I am D.I. Bascombe. In attendance is D.S. Frank.
We are talking to Jamie Miller, his appropriate adult, Eddie Miller,
and his solicitor, Paul Barlow.
The time is
6:58 a.m.
Sit up.
I'm gonna start off with asking you what you did last night, Jamie.
-Last night? -Yeah.
- Jamie. - It wasn't that long ago.
No comment.
Okay. What did you do?
No comment.
That's not really helpful, is it, Jamie?
-Sorry. -Okay. No worries.
Let's move on to something we can talk about.
I've been reading your school reports.
Why?
I got your teachers to send them over.
It's looking good. Doing really well. You're a good student.
You wanna take your A-levels?
You can answer that, Jamie.
I don't know.
Okay. They also talk about some problems with your behavior more recently.
Last year or so.
- Yeah. - Okay.
Well, what are the problems? What are they?
Uh, I dunno.
-Do you have good friends, Jamie? -Yeah.
Okay. Who are your good friends?
-No comment. -You won't get them into trouble.
You battered my door down this morning, so I'm not sure you can say that.
That's fair.
Okay, look.
I'm going to ask you about romantic relationships.
- Sexual relationships. - Why?
Well, I noticed on your Instagram that you reposted a picture of this model.
What's her name, Jamie?
I just like her pictures.
- You don't know her name? - No.
Okay. You also posted a picture of this woman.
And this woman.
And below this one, the more recent one,
you can see that there's a series of comments
and innuendos which seem pretty aggressive.
They're from you. How do you feel about women, Jamie?
- What kind of a question is that? - Are you attracted to women?
- Yeah. - Okay.
And are these the type of women you're attracted to?
- Yeah. - Okay.
-Do you have a girlfriend? -No.
If you did, would you want her to look like any of these women?
No, they're
They're too old.
That's true.
I also see that you, um, posted pics of you and who I think are friends?
Hmm? Where were these pictures taken?
Train station, I think.
Okay. Who are these boys?
I understand you don't want to get them into trouble. I get it.
But they're not gonna be in trouble, man. It's fine.
I'm just trying to build a picture.
Jamie, it won't be hard for us to find them.
You're a smart lad, aren't you? You can see that.
Go ahead. Tell 'em.
That's Tommy. That's Ryan.
Okay.
- Good friends, yeah? - Yeah.
Hmm. You're in a lot of pics with them.
Only because Tommy tagged me in 'em.
Okay. And is it always you three out together?
-Yeah. I guess so, yeah. -How long have you known them?
Year one, Tommy, and then Ryan came in year four.
Okay. What do you guys like to do together?
What's fun for you?
I I dunno.
Sports, films, music, dancing? What?
Just going into town.
- Hanging out? - Yeah.
Okay. Were you hanging out with them last night?
- No comment. - What time did you get home?
No comment.
Okay. Okay. I get it now. Everyone's trying to do their job here.
If you remember rightly, Jamie,
I was the one that suggested you get a solicitor, wasn't I?
Yeah.
All right. May I ask you what you were wearing last night?
I I don't remember.
Okay. Our scene of the crime officers
didn't find any of your clothes from last night,
but they think they've managed to find your trainers.
Can you identify these as your trainers?
Well, it's it's quite hard in a photo.
Do you own a pair of Nike Air Max in white and blue?
- Yeah. - Thank you.
Were you wearing them last night?
I I dunno. Maybe.
I don't know.
Here.
Jamie, do you know a girl called Katie Leonard? There she is.
- Yeah. - Yeah?
She's not in your reg group, is she?
But you do share some classes. That's right, innit?
- English. - English.
Top set English. Very good.
Maths and French, you're in set two.
That's good, that.
Do you two get on?
- Yeah. - Yeah?
Describe each other as friends, then?
I I don't I dunno.
Well, she occasionally comments on your Instagram posts,
so it's probably a sign that you were, like, friends, right?
I I dunno. Maybe.
And do you think other people would describe you two as friends?
What is is she who's dead, then?
Why would you ask that? Hmm?
Is she?
Well, yeah. She is.
And we think you know that.
So it's really clever of you to ask the question if that is the case.
- Careful, D.I. Bascombe. - Okay, then.
Tell you what. Describe your friendship to me.
No comment.
Right. You seem prepared to talk about your other friendships, but not this one.
- Can you tell me why? - I think that's pretty clear why.
Yeah, I'm asking Jamie.
We we knew each other at school, but not out of school.
Right. And was it a relationship that ever went beyond friendship?
I I wouldn't even class it as a friendship.
- Were you attracted to her? - No.
Was there anything that could be described as sexual between you?
No, he's 13 years of age. That's a bit strong.
I know. I've gotta ask the question, that's all.
-Can you answer it for me, kid? -No.
Was it her you were going to see last night?
-Did you go and see her? -No.
See, her parents have told us that she left the house at 8:30 p.m.
Was she coming to see you, then?
I I've just said. We weren't even mates.
- But you did see her? - No, I didn't.
Okay. Her body was found
at Crowthers' car park just past 10:30 p.m.
Paramedics arrived at the scene, were unable to stop the bleeding.
It was confirmed that she was killed less than an hour before.
Which means between 9:30 and 10:30 p.m.
Where were you at that time?
- I I don't know. - But you were out?
No comment.
Okay. And if I were to ask your dad
what time you were home, what would he say?
I was on a call. I'd been in for ten minutes
when youse kicked me door in.
- And you're not interviewing Mr. Miller. - No.
Were you following her, Jamie? Or Or were you meeting her there?
- No, neither. - Did you kill her, Jamie?
- No. - You didn't kill her?
No, I didn't.
You you've got me confused with someone else.
Okay.
Do you know how many times she was stabbed?
- No. - Seven times.
Seven times, all over.
In her chest.
Neck. Thigh. Arm.
A lot of stabbing.
Does that upset you?
Of course it does. Look at him.
She's a young girl.
You do know what CCTV is, don't you, Jamie?
Hang on. Hang on.
Um, so I think that would be a good opportunity for us to take a break,
have a private consultation.
Jay?
-Jay, you all right? -Yeah.
- Yeah? - I think we should.
-I'd insist on that. -I know. I don't think it's a good idea.
'Cause he's told them he's not even a friend.
He doesn't really know her.
And he's got nothing to hide. So go on. So he's gonna tell you.
- Fine. - Yeah.
- Okay. - Okay.
Okay, so, Jamie,
we've been looking through CCTV images of you and Katie from last night, okay?
We've gone through council footage, local businesses.
What we've managed to do is we've put together a timeline of her movements
and your movements, okay?
So this is you, isn't it? In the middle there.
Meadows Meadows Square, 7:43 p.m.
So that's you.
We can tell it's you. We can see your jumper, your jeans,
the Nike Air Max we just discussed.
And these are your two friends, Tommy, and we think Ryan. We're not too sure.
You were with them for about an hour, and then you left them.
Then you just wandered around for quite a long time, didn't you?
We see you here at the Battered Plaice, 9:02 p.m.
Got you here passing the library, 9:17 p.m.
Got you here at the corner of Shetney, 9:43 p.m.
These are you, right?
- All of 'em, yeah? - Yeah.
Good.
Then, Katie pops up.
See, we don't see when you spotted her, but we do see you following her.
Why were you following her, Jamie?
Dad.
Answer the question, son.
I wasn't--
She's walking past the crossing at 4 Bridge Street at 9:46 p.m.
You can clearly see that here. Everyone can see that, right?
And at 9:47 p.m., same place,
walking in the same direction, is you, Jamie.
So you were following her. I'll ask you again.
- Why were you following her? - I wasn't.
- Did she know you were following? - I wasn't.
Is there some sort of problem between you two?
- No. - Jamie!
Mate
It's not just gonna go away.
You sure you don't wanna tell us what happened?
You're gonna have to say it sooner or later.
I haven't done anything wrong.
Okay.
I'm now going to play you some footage.
This is of you and Katie from the car park last night
where a confrontation happened, okay?
Ja
Jay.
I think that's enough, okay?
That's where we are.
How did you get home without anyone seeing you, Jamie?
You threw away your clothes.
We didn't see when it happened, but we know it happened.
You kept your trainers.
Too expensive, am I right?
There will be blood on those trainers, Jamie.
And with this tape as evidence,
it's not looking good.
Do you want to give us a reason why?
Why would you do something like this?
Jamie, do you want to explain?
Do you want to say sorry to Katie's mum?
Who I had to talk to just past midnight last night,
while she was sobbing on the floor because her daughter is gone.
Do you wanna say sorry to her?
I'm terminating this interview at 7:12 a.m. Let's go.
I'll give you two a minute.
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
What have you done?
What have you done?
Why?
Dad, it wasn't me.
I've not done anything.
Adam
Um, I'm outside your school.
Probably gonna have to come into your class, all right?
Promise I'll leave you alone.
We could've sent someone more junior here. You know that, don't ya?
- Hello. - Mrs. Fenumore?
- Yes. - I'm D.I. Bascombe.
-Appreciate you doing this. -Hi. D.S. Frank. Nice to meet you.
Thanks so much for coming. Um
We've only just let them all back in, so, um, everyone might be a bit raw.
Yeah, we know.
We wouldn't be here if it wasn't important. Okay?
-Well, thanks for coming. -Lead on.
Um, I'll get you signed in.
- Then I'll take you around. - Thank you.
- Hello. - After you.
Tommy. Tommy!
Got a minute?
-See you later. -See you.
The police are here.
Of course they are.
-They're everywhere. -I don't like it.
Yeah, same.
You heard from him?
Everyone's talking about him. I texted him.
Yeah.
I didn't hear nothing. Did you?
Well, you won't. It's not like he's gonna have his phone on him.
Do you think it's true?
-Yeah. -You think Jamie did it?
-Yeah. -They come to your house?
-Yeah. -They ask about the knife?
-Yeah. -What did you say?
I Dad said not to talk to you about it.
-Was he mad? -Well, yeah. Of course. Weren't yours?
No, they just They just didn't say nothing.
-I don't want to be in trouble. -You're not in trouble.
-I don't want Jamie to be in trouble. -Yeah.
Well, he is.
Dickhead.
Adam, um, I'm outside your school.
Probably gonna have to come into your class, all right?
Promise I'll leave you alone.
Adam.
- Give me Â£1.20 now. - Fredo.
-Nah. Give me Â£1.20. -I don't have money.
-Give me Â£1.20 now. -Fredo! Fredo, leave him alone.
- I need Â£1.20, though, sir. - No, you don't. You're on free dinners.
Fourteen parents I've had. Fourteen.
"Is your school safe?"
Oh God. What do you say?
I say the matter didn't even happen on school property.
Then they talk about security guards and metal detectors.
Mia Taylor told me we need to open a grief support room.
We're security guards and social workers now, are we? Great.
Well, I just worry about the impact it's gonna have on the kids. It's a lot.
-Just keep keep an eye on it. Yeah? -Okay.
- Thanks. - Uh, shirt, please.
-And you, Sean. Come on. -Sorry, miss.
What the fuck's she on about? Fucking hell.
Come, let's go see what the boys are saying. You know what?
-I say we go fuck Jamie up. -Nah, mate. No point.
-Well, we break in, man. -Break in? How are you gonna do that?
-Shut up, man. -Are you guys from Heywood Street?
Yeah.
Get inside!
Hey, Jade.
Do you wanna pop inside the office for us?
Okay?
Thank you. Thanks.
Take a seat.
Thanks, love. Take a seat.
-Go on. You go on that one. -All right.
- Here. - Thank you.
You're welcome. Here you go.
Thanks.
-Hi, Jade. -Hiya.
You all right?
Look, I'm I'm D.I. Bascombe. This is D.S. Frank.
And this is Mrs. Fenumore. She's from the school.
She's gonna keep an eye on things from the school's perspective,
give you any support you may want or need, okay?
I teach at the lower school, Jade. Okay?
Uh, Jade, we are, um
We're really grateful that you agreed to talk to us.
I agreed, did I?
And I thought I just got pulled off lunch.
Okay, well, we did try to get you at home,
but your mum wasn't sure what time you'd be back, so
-Look, if you don't mind, we wanted to-- -I don't mind.
I'm the lead investigator on Katie's case.
I wanted to give you my card.
Has the station number on the front
and also a crime reference number on the back.
This is to help you keep up
with the progress of Katie's case, all right?
-You can take that. -Wow.
It's a bit flash, don't you think?
Okay.
Look, uh, we can tell you that we have arrested, uh, one suspect, all right--
Yeah, Jamie.
But we need some more information.
Both on the murder weapon, which we don't yet have,
and why the suspect did it.
Jade, you were good friends with Katie. That's right, isn't it?
Her best friend.
Ask anyone.
Can you tell us about her?
Ain't you got a kid in the school?
Yeah. Yeah.
Adam, right?
- Yeah. - He's off, if you didn't know.
He didn't get your cheekbones.
- I don't see what that has to do-- - Can you tell me about him?
Listen.
All you need to know is she's dead.
She shouldn't be. 'Cause she got stabbed.
She was the best person I knew. That's it.
Uh, Jade, was Katie happy?
Well, she didn't stab herself.
What was her relationship with boys like?
You mean with Jamie? She wouldn't go anywhere near him.
- Really? - Yeah.
Interesting. Are you saying that she didn't like him?
Because we've got Instagram posts from her that suggest that they were friends.
- So, you're trying to blame this on her? - No.
Well, you've got video. Everyone knows.
You should be sorting out the guy that killed her.
- We're not asking you to talk-- - You are!
- You are! I can hear it in all of ya. - No, Jade. Jade.
- Can I go? - A bit of politeness.
Well, I ain't feeling polite today. Can I go now, Miss Lower School?
Mrs. Fenumore, it's fine. It's okay. You can go, Jade. Thank you.
Fucking useless.
You guys are meant to be best of the police?
Jade.
I'm so sorry. She's very upset.
- Shall we crack on? - Shall we?
-Yeah? -Yeah, let's go.
-Okay. -Sorry about that.
It's okay.
Um, all right. We'll start you in 8G.
-That's Jamie's class. -Yeah, we know.
And you've spoken to some of the boys. Uh, Ryan and Tommy?
Does everyone know everything about this case? Huh?
Well, I think people are gonna know more than you think all day, so
Oh, I get it, but they shouldn't. It doesn't matter. Let's go.
Guys! Stop it. Sit
Hey, everybody, sit down!
James! Put the phones away, please!
- Where's. Mr. Malik? - He's late. Don't grass on him.
- Right. Detective Bascombe. - Hi.
He's got something he wants to talk to you all about.
All right, guys. Look, as many of you may know, right--
Oh, I'm so sorry. Uh, Detective Sergeant Frank?
-Frank. It's fine. -I'm sorry. Apologies.
It's okay. As many of you may know, there was a tragic incident
that took place the night before last, okay?
It involved a fatality among one of your schoolmates.
- Did Jamie do it? - Listen to the man.
Oh, shit, he did!
-Stop swearing, please! -Look, calm down. We have made one arrest.
But we are here today
because we still haven't found the murder weapon.
All right? I know that sounds very serious and scary,
but you guys may have some information that we need.
So we're just asking, please come to us and talk to us if you need to, all right?
-Is it true you've got a video? -Please.
Any other situations, any other issues connected to this case,
you can also come and talk to--
Mr. Malik, we protected you.
Sorry I'm late. You must be the police, yeah?
"You must be the police!" I love you, Mr. Malik!
Mr. Malik.
I'm gonna give Mr. Malik my card. It has the police station number on it.
If you wanna talk, you've got information, go to Mr. Malik. He'll come to us. Right?
-Thank you. Take care. -Thank you.
Thank you very much. Wait.
Yeah, we're getting back to the film now, uh, so
Uh, Marie, you wanna get your pen out?
I ain't got a pen, sir.
Why do schools have that same smell?
It's like a mixture of vomit, cabbage, and masturbation.
Yeah, sure.
Do you really think we're gonna find a knife here?
Uh, we may have enough. We may.
But if we don't find that knife, he's got a bargaining chip, hasn't he?
You know how it goes. And we saw him walk past the school on CCTV.
-It was dark, I know-- -Yeah, I get it.
And I don't have a motive.
I know you need a motive.
I just honestly don't understand why that Jade girl was so angry.
She's upset, mate. They're all gonna be very upset.
I know. I get that. I'm just saying she made it seem like Katie hated Jamie.
I'm so sorry about that. Mr. Malik's newly qualified.
-It's all good. Thank you. -Shall we carry on?
Let's go.
I did send a note around telling everybody that you was coming.
What do you wanna do? You wanna go to isolation?
Because I can send you to isolation. No problem whatsoever.
There's no phones allowed in class at all!
All the teachers are really upset by this too, as you can see.
Um, I just Everyone's just devastated.
I taught Katie in year five.
She was so bright.
Just such a beautiful little girl.
You know, she talked a little bit too much, but
I really thought she was gonna do something with her life.
Yeah. It's a horrible shock for everybody, isn't it?
Yeah. It's devastating.
Okay, um, follow me. We'll carry on.
Hello.
- I've got no idea. - You all right?
Look, keep an eye out for any of the kids that react funny when we're in the class.
-We'll chase 'em up after school, yeah? -Yeah.
Good.
Um, and just to say, I can supply you with any names you like or addresses too.
Okay, Mrs. Fenumore. That would be useful, all right?
-That's all I want to be. Useful. -Can we go to 10G?
Yes, of course, uh, Mr. Curtis.
It's a great question, and one--
- Excuse me! - I need--
Right, that is it! Not another word!
-Put your pens down! -Fucking hell.
Put your hands down and watch the video.
Mr. Curtis, would it be all right if we come in?
- The police would like to talk. - Mr. Curtis.
-You all right? -You all right?
- Hi. D.S. Frank. - You all right?
-Everything okay? -Yeah. Want a quick word with the kids.
Okay, so this is D.I. Bascombe and D.S. Frank
from Heywood Street Police Station.
They'd like to talk about what happened to Katie.
Now, they're here because they care about this school.
And, as many of you know, D.I. Bascombe is also Adam's dad.
Adam.
All right, that's enough.
I said stop that, Fredo. I said stop!
See me after class. I'm sorry. That's unacceptable.
-It's all right. -Have some respect.
Uh, guys, I don't wanna keep you long, all right?
You know there was a terrible crime that was committed in our town
the night before last.
And we're just here trying to understand what--
You've gotta be kidding. I'm sorry.
- Okay, make an orderly line. - I'm so sorry about this.
There's no smoke.
You're supposed to be filing out of the school.
Try and stay in straight lines.
-Sir, you think it's terrorism? -No, Billie, it isn't terrorism.
No running. Stay in lines!
All right, straight down to the tennis courts. No messing about.
No time to grab your things. Straight down. No messing.
Thank you.
It'll be a false alarm.
Although, someone did throw a set of fireworks
into the computer lab last year.
We had a fire. Um
-Crowthers were selling ten for a quid. -Not very helpful.
It wasn't very good, no. Uh, but we managed to contain it, so
Did you guys come? The police were here.
-No, it wasn't us. -No? They were very helpful.
All right, we'll make our way to the tennis courts. Follow me.
- Hurry up!. - Thank you.
Hurry. Quickly.
- Keep moving. - Keep moving.
- Thanks so much. - Keep it moving.
- So where are we going? - In the tennis courts.
Mr. Malik, can I have a word?
Yeah.
-I've been reading your school reports. -Yeah.
Jamie was a good student, yeah?
-Are we allowed to talk out here? -Yeah. Yeah.
I wanna know, was there any signs of unhappiness?
-I'm I'm just a tutor. I mean-- -Well, you're a teacher.
Yeah, but I teach history. I don't see him, you know? I don't

-Yeah. -Okay.
You just got banged by a girl, you sausage.
Shut it, you.
We're gonna go up to my room, but we're gonna go really slowly, okay?
See that? Ryan just got banged by a girl!

Straight in. Back to class. Thank you.
Inside, you're on TikTok Hating a teenager
Thirteen, making my own paper
Put that phone away and get back to class now!
- Shut up, Miss. - Excuse me?
God's sake.
I said keep going, please. Up the stairs. Let's go.
-Are you sure it's not on fire? -No, it's not. Get to class. Thank you.
Okay, guys. Keep it moving.
Keep it moving. Thank you.
- That's it. Straight back to classrooms. - Thank you.
- Quick as you can. - Upstairs.
- Sorry. - It's all right.
Thank you.
Okay, well done. Get back to class. Well done.
All right, here we are.
Hi, Carla. Can we come in, please? The police would like to talk to Ryan.
Right, yeah. Uh, I'm just gonna check this.
Okay, look at me. Look at my nose.
Okay, well, that looks all right. But you did land on it.
Hey, miss. Uh, do you mind if I have a word with Ryan?
- Is that all right with you, Ryan? - Yeah.
- Okay. - All right?
- Yeah, of course. - Thank you.
-Do you mind if I sit down, mate? -Yeah.
- All good. - Am I all right here, Ryan?
- Yeah. - Yeah.
Thank you.
That was, uh
It was a bit mad, weren't it?
-Yeah. -I think you're gonna have a black eye.
-Yeah, hopefully not. -Yeah.
Well, when I was, uh when I was around your age, I
I ran into a bus shelter because I wanted a black eye.
- What? - I know. It's crazy.
Don't ask.
I was probably a bit younger than you. Maybe about nine.
Did it work?
Well, I wanted to look like a cowboy.
In the end, I ended up losing a tooth and looking like a, uh
Yeah, I can't say. But it hurt.
It's crazy, you know, what your brain tells you to do when you're a kid, right?
-Yeah, you were popular in school, though. -What makes you say that?
I just know. You were.
Well, I was, once I got rid of the big Afro that I had.
My mum wouldn't let me cut my hair for ages, so
Once I got it cut, I got a fade, things were different.
Yeah.
Is popularity important to you, Ryan?
- Of course. - Yeah?
- Yeah. - When we spoke to you last--
- Tommy said you spoke to him and all. - Yeah.
His, uh his dad won't let him say nothing.
That's true. It's not entirely right, but
I mean, would you like to have
your guardian here or solicitor here, Ryan?
- No, thank you. - Okay.
Were you, like, really popular?
- Yeah. - With girls and stuff?
I did okay.
Um, doesn't look like you knocked out any teeth.
-You don't believe me, no? -Mm.
I'll show you. Look. See that one there?
-Oh, yeah. -Yeah.
-Is that a cap or a filling? -Filling.
Mm. I got all me teeth.
- Brush 'em dead careful. - Okay.
I don't know why they matter so much, but they do.
Yeah.
Look, mate, we, uh
We're getting clearer on the geography of that night, you know?
But there's still three things that we feel you can help us with.
Okay, Carla, um, is it all right if I go now, because I'm--
It's better if you stay a little bit longer. Okay?
Okay.
Sorry, what was you saying?
Look, uh, what
We wanna know what Jamie intended.
And what motiv
Do you know what I mean by "motivated"? Yeah?
Yeah. And "intended."
Good. All right. So what motivated him to do
Why he did what he did, right? We think you can help with that. And, um
You know, like, for instance, on the night, was he happy or sad?
I don't know. Normal.
Okay. Well, what did you talk about?
Nothing, really. Just hung out.
This is gonna be seem like a really silly question to you.
But, look
Did Jamie ever talk to you about his feelings?
Like, how he was feeling?
Yeah, nah.
-No? -No.
Can we talk about Katie?
I don't really know anything about her, so
Can we talk about what Jamie said about Katie?
I didn't I didn't know anything about what he was gonna do.
All right.
Would you describe Katie and Jamie as friends? Would you?
I don't think so. Not really. Um
Like I say, I didn't really get to know her.
Anyway, can I go now? Because I'm fine.
- Ryan. - Wait.
We're not finished. I've got one question, and this is a really important one, right?
We still haven't found the knife that Jamie used--
Yeah, cool, but I need to go now. They said they'd keep me back.
-They won't, Ryan. Just, please-- -Please. I need to get back.
You've hit your head, so can you come back in? Ryan!
- I don't want water. - Mrs. Bailey?
- Yes. - Her mum's been called.
Thank you.
- Are you serious? - Your mum needs to be told.
She'll be mad at me 'cause she'll have to get out of work.
What
How are you two? Are you Are you getting on better now?
It's okay, yeah.
I did say it might not be best to come in today, didn't I, love?
Where do you want me going?
Mum doesn't like me in her house without her there.
I'm not walking around places
I'm not walking around places Katie's been, so
You know, I I'd go to her house.
-That's where I'd go if I wasn't here. -Go to her house, then.
No.
Listen, go to her house. I'm sure her parents would love to see ya.
No, trust me. Trust me, they wouldn't.
- Miss? - Yes?
Am I in trouble?
Oh God.
Sit down.
Come on. Sit down, please.
You know you're in trouble.
Will the police come by the house because I don't
I don't know. That depends what Ryan decides.
-But he's only a little boy. -So, then why did you do it?
I don't know.
I know you're hurt and you're upset,
but you don't know Ryan's got anything to do with what happened to Katie.
Talk to me. Come on.
She was my best friend, miss.
She was the only one who actually
She was the only one who actually thought I was okay.
I don't know what to do anymore.
I don't know what to do anymore 'cause it's not like I have anyone else now.
- Yes. Yes, you do. - No, I don't.
Yes, you do, love. You've got lots of people.
- No, I don't. You're only saying that. - I'm not. But this
Jade, this is a huge loss, love.
So we'll arrange for somebody for you to have a chat to.
-Not another shrink. -It's not a shrink.
-No, fuck that. -Somebody for you to talk to. Please.
-Are you serious? -No, you can't go back to class.
-Every fucking time. -Come on, Jade, darling. Stay with me.
- You've got to stay with me. - Leave me alone, miss.
- Please! - Repeat with me.
Jade, come on, love. Please.

And you can help me understand? Yeah? That's what you're saying?
-Adam, is this-- -You wanna go.
-I don't wanna go. -You wanna go to the gym or work.
-The door's right there. Just leave, Dad. -I'm here. What ?
Have you got information about that? Do you know where that knife is?
Has someone said something?
Because, listen, I've got sniffer dogs,
people down drains, and all sorts of stuff.
Dad.
It's not going well 'cause you're not getting it.
What am I not getting?
You're not reading what they're doing. What's happening.
What are you talking about?
Insta. You've been looking at Insta, right?
Yeah.
Uh, okay. So you've, um
You've seen what she wrote?
I have.
-Okay. -Looks like she's being nice, right?
Isn't she? Hmm?
The dynamite. What do you think that means?
Uh, I don't know.
An exploding red pill. The blue pills mean you see the world as it wants you to--
That's when the Matrix You've been watching The Matrix ?
What?
-Don't worry. Yeah. Don't worry, carry on. - The Matrix.
Carry on.
The red pill's like, "I see the truth."
It's a call to action by the manosphere.
"Manosphere"?
Which is where the 100 comes in. The 80 to 20 rule.
Adam, Adam. Listen.
My brain can't take all this.
I don't know what you're talking about. Just break it down.
80% of women are attracted to 20% of men.
Women. You must trick them
'cause you'll never get them in a normal way.
80% of women are cut off or
Or she's saying he's an incel, Dad.
He's 13. How can you be involuntarily celibate at 13?
-Dad, I know-- -Who isn't celibate at 13? Huh?
She's saying he always will be. "You're an incel."
You're gonna be, I don't know, a virgin forever, basically.
And all those people have hearted, which means they're agreeing with her.
Okay. So this is
This is bullying?
I mean, it's it's a bit of a stretch, Ad, but
-You don't believe me, Dad. -I'm not saying I don't believe you.
Where are you going? Hey, stop. What are you doing?
This is useful.
I I I didn't know.
It's just hard to believe, like, all that from two symbols.
You text hearts, right? To Mum?
-When I don't know what to reply, yeah. -What color?
-Red. -Means love.
Purple, horny. Yellow, I'm interested. Are you interested?
Pink, I'm interested, but not in sex.
Orange, you're gonna be fine. It all has a meaning, Dad.
Everything has a meaning.
Well, it's
It's a good thing I only text Mum red, then, innit?
Okay.
I could, um, show you 15 others. Messages sent to Jamie.
All different emojis. They're saying the same thing.
Look
are you saying
that Katie is leading this incel stuff?
Is that what it is? Yeah, like she's bullying Jamie? Yeah?
Dad. I I don't know, Dad. I I don't know them.
They're two years below me.
This is This is just what I'm seeing on his Insta, you know?
Okay. Okay.
Look, I I can't tell you what he did. You know that, right?
We all know what he did, Dad.
I just thought you needed to know.
It was just embarrassing watching you blunder about.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
I have been blundering, to be fair.
Look
Does any of this Instagram stuff affect you? Hmm?
-It's not about me. -I know.
But does it, son?
You don't call me "son."
You call other people "son." You never call me "son."
Okay. I'm sorry.
No.
I'm on Insta, but I don't post.
-And you're okay, yeah? -Yeah, I'm fine.
- Okay. Listen. - Yeah.
-Thank you. Yeah? -Yeah.
-I appreciate it. -Yeah. Um
All right.
I should, um get back to the last bit of class.
Okay. You go.
Hey, thank y--
They pick everything up.
You all right?
Yeah. Um
We were wrong about all that Instagram stuff.
-What do you mean? -Katie was bullying Jamie.
-Oh no. -That's what it was.
Incel stuff. You know what that is.
Yeah, I do.
No, I don't know what that is. What is it?
It's the, um, involuntary celibate stuff. It's the Andrew Tate shite.
-Fucking hell. -I've heard the boys talking about him.
Yeah. Uh, look, Mrs. Fenumore, thank you so much.
-You can go now. We've -Thank you.
-Thank you very much. Nice to meet you. -Sure? I can take you
Are you sure you don't want to go or need to go somewhere?
No, we're all good. Thank you very much.
Well, it's good to be useful, and I'll be in the office if you need anything.
But I just want to say thank you so much.
We really appreciate everything you've you've done.
-Thank you. -No worries. Thank you.
-Thank you. -Bye.
-Bye-bye. -Bye.
Fucking hell.
Yeah, fucking hell.
Do you know what? I honestly I just can't stand this fucking place.
- You wanted to come, mate. - Yeah, I know, but
Does it look like anyone's learning anything in there to you? Hmm?
It just looks like a fucking holding pen.
Videos in every class.
Mr. Malik just walking in and out when he wants.
-And you said it fucking smells. -It does fucking stink.
All schools stink.
Just come here. Just have a minute here.
Just get our head round this.
There'll be some good teachers in here and some good students.
-My school was a bit like this. -Well, how did you survive, then?
'Cause I had a good teacher. I had Mrs. Benton, who was fucking class.
She taught, um, art and photography.
I liked drawing pictures and stuff.
Mm. Nice.
All kids really need is one thing that makes them feel okay about themselves.
You want kids?
-You have never asked me that before. -I know. I'm just
It's not something you ask your colleague.
Well, you can ask your mates, can't you? And no. No, not really.
-I never wanted 'em. -No?
But I do love him very much.
Is he all right?
I mean, that is the longest he's spoken to me in a while, so
Surely that's a good thing, no?
Yeah, but Look, I I just
Sometimes I don't think I'm the right fit for him as a dad.
You know what I mean?
Well, I know you. And I know you can be. Do you know what I mean?
Yeah.
All right. Look
-We haven't got the knife. -No.
But, um
I think back to the station. Do you? Yeah. We've got what we need anyway now.
-Mish. -What?
You've hated being here, yeah? I get it. What's up?
It's not even that, you know?
-Do you know what I don't like about this? -Go on.
Right, the perpetrator always gets the front line.
"A man raped a woman."
We've followed Jamie's brain around this entire case.
-Hmm. Yeah. -Right? Katie isn't important. Jamie is.
Everyone will remember Jamie. No one will remember her.
That's what annoys me. That's what gets to me.
I think you're wrong. I think we're here for Katie.
We're here for her parents. We're here to get answers.
It's our job to understand why.
You can't understand why. Do you actually think you can?
We've got the video. We know what he did.
You're not gonna know why. Look at the things we've seen.
You are not gonna know why. You just won't.
Okay, Mish, look. Go back to the station.
-I'm gonna talk to Ryan one last time. -But you've spoken to Ryan.
I know, but he's he's not saying something.
I know there's more.
- You coming or not? - Fuck's sake.
- Mr. Malik. - Oh, for fuck's sake.
How can I help?
- I need to have a word with Ryan. - Sir, at least stop the tape.
It's a good bit.
- One second. Ryan. Come on. - Ryan.
- Holy shit! Holy shit! - Whoa!
Come here! Ryan!
Stop running. Stop, mate.
Ryan!
Hey, hey, hey!
Ryan!
Stop!

Ryan. Ryan.
Mind the road! Mind the road!
Fuck!
Hey. Where are you going? Stop running!
Get the fuck down. What the fuck are you doing?!
Come here. Come here.
-What does "incel" mean to you? -What?
Incel. Katie called Jamie an incel. What does it mean?
-Who did you get that off? -Was she bullying him?!
-Why are you always talking to me? -What do you mean?
-Tommy! Talk to him. -Fuck Tommy!
What's he got to do with anything? You know Jamie!
-He knows Jamie. -No, he doesn't! Not like you.
Listen. I'm gonna ask you one question. I want a fucking serious answer.
- Do you understand? - All right. Yes!
-Did you help him get that knife? -No, man.
Ryan, do not play with me. Did you help him?
-No. -Hey!
There's a dead fucking girl! Right?
-All right. Right. -Answer the question. Talk.
Right.
It was It was my knife.
-I just want things the way they were. -Fucking hell.
-I thought he'd just scare her. -Where is it?
I don't know.
-Where the fuck is it? -I don't know!
-All right. You're coming with me. -What?
-That's it. You're under arrest. Stop! -Get off!
Ryan Kowalska, I am arresting you on suspicion of conspiracy to murder.
You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defense
if you do not mention when questioned something you later rely on in court,
anything you do say may be given in evidence.
Get off me!
Please, I don't wanna go!
-Get off! -Fucking hell.
I haven't run like that in years.
Get off!
Fuck.
-You good with this? Yeah? -Yep.
Just, uh, book him in. Notify anyone that needs to know.
Yep. Will do.
And, yeah. Charge Jamie.
Without you?
Yeah. We've got everything that we need now. All right?
Yeah.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm good. Um
There's something something I want to sort out.
-Sure you're all right? -I'm good. See you in a bit.
Yeah, all right. See you there.
Fuck.
Adam!
You all right?
-What's up? Come here. -I don't want a lift. I'll take the bus.
No, no, no. I'm not I'm not offering you a lift.
Come. Come here.
Look, uh
I'm hungry.
All right? And, uh, I was gonna
I was gonna get some chips and a Coke. I wanted to know if you wanted to come.
-You've got your case. -Yes, I know I've got my case.
All right? It's nearly done now. I'm about to hand it over.
I've got some free time. I want to spend it with you.
Because I love you. All right?
Yeah. Um, I can be hungry.
Good. Thank you.
Come on. Get in the car.
Look, uh, put your bag in the back and put your seatbelt on, please.
So, come on. How was school? What lessons did you have?
Um, maths, chemistry, and French.
Français?
You speak French, yeah?
- Yeah. - Well, go on, then.
Um , je m'appelle. Â¿CÃ³mo estÃ¡? Ã‡a va bien.
S'il vous plaÃ®t?
All right, stop. That's enough. That is enough.
You're destroying the language.
So, where do you wanna go for chips?
Uh, the Chinese place on Chapel Hill.
Why would we go to a Chinese for chips, Adam?
Listen, it's the best.
The salt and pepper chips. The barbecue sauce.
-Maybe even a bit of mayo on top. Bang! -All right. It better be. It better be.
It better be good.
The Earth, home to millions of species.
But what might live... beyond?
There are countless planets throughout the universe.
If life exists on only a fraction of them,
then the universe must be... alive.
All living things have the same needs.
To feed...
reproduce...
and evolve.
By applying the laws of life on Earth
to the rest of the universe...
it's possible to imagine
what could live...
on alien worlds.
All life forms need a planet to live on.
But how many planets are there in the universe?
Think about our star,
the Sun,
with Earth, Mars, Jupiter orbiting it.
For centuries,
people have asked themselves, "What about the other stars?
Uh, do they have planets as well?"
And 24 years ago,
I found one!
Didier Queloz is a superstar astrophysicist.
He has won the Nobel Prize for discovering the first planet
beyond our solar system.
I was 28 years old when I found the planet.
I was about to finish my PhD,
and my PhD adviser gave me the key of the equipment.
And after observing a couple of times, the star 51 Peg,
I realized that something was going on on that star.
And frankly, I just panicked at that time.
I thought something was really wrong with my equipment.
And the more I wanted to understand this, the less it made sense.
Until the point I got convinced it must be a planet.
That's likely to be a planet over there.
Could be Jupiter over there.
It's pretty cool.
Distant planets are invisible to telescopes
because they don't emit any light.
But if a planet passes in front of a star,
it casts a tiny shadow,
and there's a minuscule dimming of the star's brightness.
When astronomers detect this dip in light level,
they have found a new planet.
Hello, guys.
Uh... Oh, hey. Here is what the telescope is looking at.
This is a picture of the telescope right now.
Uh, in the middle, you have the... the target we're observing.
So, you analyze this whole field, you process the data,
and, um, if you're lucky enough, you detect this.
There's a little bit of a decrease of the flux,
and this tells me that there is a planet orbiting that star.
We know there are a huge number of planets in the universe.
There must be a zillion kinds of different life.
Let's imagine that this is the Earth, here...
Right?
So, imagine that one meter is 20 light-years.
So, I've made two meters as 40 light-years.
This is where you have 51 Peg, where the first planet was detected.
Each of these tiny lights represents a star
where a planet has been found.
Over the next few years,
planets were turning up everywhere.
Planets, planets everywhere
It looks pretty cool right now.
A horizon of stars and planets...
all around.
Planets beyond our solar system are called exoplanets.
Astronomers have found over 4,000 of them.
And they keep finding more.
They now believe there's at least one planet for every star in the universe.
That means over a million, billion, trillion exoplanets.
More than all the grains of sand on Earth.
A vast canvas for the evolution of life.
The distances are mind-boggling.
The nearest exoplanets are trillions of miles from us.
But they're all subject to the same force that holds the Earth in place.
Gravity.
Imagine a world double the size of Earth,
with twice as much gravity.
This is Atlas.
How would life adapt on such a world?
Gravity pulls vegetation to the planet's surface.
And yet, seeds can float in the sky.
That's because gravity here is so strong.
Air molecules are densely packed together...
creating a thick, buoyant atmosphere for seeds to drift through.
And where there are seeds...
there are sky grazers.
Giant herbivores with six wings
to ride on the dense pillow of air.
Because of the extra gravity,
they weigh twice as much as they would on Earth.
But they don't fall from the sky.
The atmosphere is thick enough to keep them airborne.
Whether on Atlas or on Earth,
flying is always a battle to overcome gravity.
You might say I have a pretty complicated relationship with gravity.
And you can really feel that gravity is a force pulling you down
as you struggle your way up.
But ultimately, my dream has always been to be able to fly.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
The thing I love most about paragliding is that it's so simple and intuitive.
It's just you and the air.
Like the sky grazers on Atlas,
paragliders use their wings to generate lift.
But the atmosphere is less dense on Earth...
so it takes more effort to stay airborne.
Most people don't see air as a substance.
But for me, when I'm flying,
I really see it as a fluid that's moving up and down the valleys
and along the ridges.
It would be really weird to fly in a very dense atmosphere.
You could just be gliding around the whole time, effortlessly.
The best way to gain altitude is to find an updraft,
known as a "thermal."
When you hit the thermal, it's very similar
to when you're in an elevator and it starts.
You feel a push upwards.
Yeah, there we go!
Just the power of nature to pull me up.
When I'm flying and I see a bird circling up,
it means there must be a thermal there.
So we're always constantly looking at them.
You can really feel the balance between the gravity pulling you down
and the air lifting you up.
You can then use your bodyweight to gain speed,
and use that speed to generate more energy
and feel that you're moving through the air.
Gravity may be weaker on Earth than on Atlas...
but the thinner atmosphere means there's less buoyancy.
So, eventually, everything falls.
On Atlas, the sky grazers never need to land.
Their front and back wings are for direction and thrust.
Their long middle wings are for catching thermals.
Despite their weight,
the air is thick enough for them to live a life
in the sky.
But it's not always a peaceful life.
As on Earth, grazers attract predators.
Using hydrogen-producing bacteria to inflate their air sacs,
they take to the skies.
Alone, they're no match for their prey...
so they hunt in a pack...
waiting for a sky grazer to stray from the group.
Target sighted, they expel their gas...
and attack from above.
The fastest predator on Earth
uses the same tactic.
My interest in flying falcons is...
their predatory instinct coupled with the speed factor...
and how they use that speed to their advantage.
But just watching a top predator do its thing...
is perfection.
I probably have 30-some birds at this moment.
Each bird is a different personality.
What I love about falcons
is how evolution has made the most perfect specimen.
I do have a relationship with these guys.
Certainly from my end, I do.
I don't think the falcons see it that way,
but they certainly see me as part of the team.
Vahe Alaverdian trains captive-bred falcons how to hunt.
These birds are genetically programmed
to be the top-notch avian predators that they are.
What we do as falconers
is try to awaken that predatorial nature in the bird.
Lure training is the very first step.
Come on, buddy! Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup!
I want to put that lure in front of the bird,
and get the falcon to coordinate eye to foot...
Hup, hup!
...and throw its feet out as if it's gonna grab it.
As that happens, I try to pull that away from the falcon
to get it to shoot up in the air and repeat this process again.
I wanna see that bird drop down as vertical as it can.
That's something that they later on will apply to hunting game.
When the falcons are ready, Vahe introduces a prey target...
a racing pigeon.
The falcon can't keep up with the pigeon in a chase,
so its best bet is to drop on it...
using gravity.
When the bird thinks that he's got the advantage,
that's when the wings will get tucked in.
They stoop into a little teardrop shape...
coming down from the heavens.
The kinetic energy of a falcon hitting a pigeon
would be as if you were hit by a cannonball.
In training, the pigeon invariably gets away,
because the falcon is made to stoop from less than a thousand feet.
When hunting for real,
it'll drop from a greater height...
to lethal effect.
The predators make their move.
They deploy their wings
to create drag...
destabilizing the sky grazer
to devour it on the ground.
But this pack is too small to take down such a large beast.
Today, they'll go hungry.
The sky grazer climbs to a safe height...
to recuperate.
But as a fertile female,
she has company.
Male grazers, competing to be chosen as a mate.
Their oversized tails are a handicap,
making it harder to fly.
But to the female, they're a sign of vitality.
The first to reach her gets to mate
and pass on his genes.
The same principle applies on Earth,
whether up in the sky
or down in the dirt.
Males compete for the right to mate.
I think when people sit at home watching insects on television,
they imagine the cameraman sitting in the jungle,
in a river or in a hedge,
waiting for this beetle to come across
and reproduce or have a fight in front of the camera.
It doesn't work that way.
This is a ramshackle old shed which is attached to my parents' place,
which is just there.
Huge advantages to having a place attached to your mum and dad's.
You get good dinners in the evening and, uh, teas arriving during the day.
- Have a look and see what we're doing. - Oh!
Oh, gosh.
Oh! What on Earth are they?
They are rhinoceros beetles.
The male's got these big horns.
The female doesn't. It's a form of sexual selection,
because the females like males with big horns.
So every time they mate,
they'll mate with a beetle that has a slightly bigger horn
- than the one they've last seen before. - Oh!
And, therefore, that male passes its genes on.
So, over generations, the horns will get bigger.
- Anywhere particular? - Um, just on the...
on the log facing the other male.
Here they go. They're going straight away.
The horns of a male rhinoceros beetle
are like the tail of a male sky grazer.
They've evolved for sexual competition.
- Ha-ha! - That dominant one's done it again.
That's a good shot. The shot we wanted.
- Yeah. - Going into her, yeah.
One, two, three.
- That right? - Yeah.
- Yep. - That's it.
- Can I... Yes. - You putting that in?
Male insects don't always fight to snare a mate.
Sometimes it's enough just to show off their physical prowess.
Right, I'm gonna bring the male in front of you.
He's coming in from your right.
Now, uh... He's flown off.
These are stalk-eyed flies.
Stalk-eyed fly is an amazing little thing.
It looks a little bit like an ant with massive eyes on the ends of stalks.
Both the male and the female have eyes on the end of stalks,
but the male has much longer eye stalks than the female.
The males with the long stalks will come up to one another,
and they will, kind of, have a little dance.
And they will try and judge
which of the two of them has the bigger stalks.
There they are. That's the standoff!
The winner of that will remain where they are and the loser will then toddle off.
That winner then will gain access to the female,
and be able to reproduce with her,
and that way can pass on the genetics that he has,
which will include that of a longer eye stalk.
- Yes! Got it. - Are... are you on it?
Oh, It's fantastic.
Normally, it's a second and they're gone. This is fantastic.
Why would the male stalk-eyed fly go to the effort
of having these enormous eye stalks?
Well, the idea is that you are conspicuously signaling to the female
that you can have this incredible investment of energy into this resource
that is completely needless.
And if you can still survive,
if you can carry on flying and living and not getting predated upon,
and still have this... wasteful extravagance coming out of your head,
then you're gonna be a pretty good bet to reproduce with.
On Atlas,
the long tailÂ of the maleÂ sky grazer shows he's an ideal choice...
to father the next generation.
But the mother can't lay her eggs in the sky.
So she's come down to land.
Because of the gravity, she's too heavy to launch herself back into the sky.
To create new life, she must surrender her own.
The babies grow up close to where their mothers die.
Now they need to get off the ground and into the air.
But scavengers lie in wait.
Boneless creatures
with no skeleton to give them form.
They kill by enveloping and dissolving their prey.
The sky grazers have only just hatched, but already they're in grave danger.
And now, there's no going back.
Every day on Earth,
young animals have to overcome terrible odds,
if they're to survive.
Sixty percent of meerkats don't make it to their first birthday.
For a young meerkat, in their early life,
there's a lot of danger here.
They're vulnerable for many months after they're born...
but particularly in the first month or two after they emerge from the burrow.
Predators are everywhere, and a constant danger.
There are snakes in this area
that will eat a young meerkat.
A young meerkat is safe within a group,
but if it lags behind, it's vulnerable.
Scorpions are a constant threat.
The young are really completely incompetent,
and totally ignorant when it comes to dealing with scorpions, initially.
But they can't avoid this danger forever.
They're going to eventually have to learn how to neutralize the threat.
The first time that a young meerkat faces a scorpion
and it has to deal with it itself
is probably a terrifying encounter.
This is a real moment of truth.
It's a real rite of passage, because once they've managed to do that themselves,
then they really are at a stage where they can start to forage by themselves
and become independent and be a useful group member.
So, they've really managed to escape the vulnerability of being a pup
and made that transition into being an adult.
It's one step on the road to adulthood,
but it's by no means plain sailing after that.
There are a lot of threats out there,
and it will have to continue to learn in order to reach adulthood.
If the young sky grazers are to grow up,
they have no choice.
It's time to fly.
Even in the air, they're still not safe.
On Atlas, survival is a game of chance.
Life goes on from one generation to the next.
At least for now.
The strong gravity of Atlas pulls asteroids onto a collision course.
Most burn up in the atmosphere.
But there's a constant threat something big will get through...
and reset the course of life on the planet.
Because gravity is weaker on Earth than Atlas,
asteroid strikes are less frequent.
But when they do occur, they can be catastrophic.
This is the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula.
27,000 square miles of tropical jungle.
But hidden within the jungle are numerous sinkholes called cenotes.
These are entrances to vast underground cave systems.
There's no surface rivers or streams in the peninsula,
so the only source of water is underground in caves.
But the really interesting thing is the location of these cenotes.
Although there's probably 10,000 or more cenotes across the peninsula,
in the northwest corner...
they occur in a very well-defined semicircle.
If we follow that semicircle out into the Gulf of Mexico...
we now have a complete circle that marks what one would expect
from the edge of an asteroid impact crater.
65 million years ago,
gravity pulled an asteroid into our solar system.
It smashed into our planet,
causing the extinction of 75 percent of life on Earth.
The asteroid strikeÂ generated enough debris
to block out sunlight for two years.
A world plunged into darkness.
Nothing could grow.
This would happen on Atlas
if a big enough asteroid hit the planet.
Cenotes are difficult places to survive...
just like the Earth was 65 million years ago.
What are the characteristics that a species needs to survive an extinction?
Somebody's in here.
So, crocodiles are very resilient animals.
They live both in the water and on land.
They're generalists. They don't require a specific diet.
They'll eat almost anything.
Whatever is available is good enough,
they'll take it.
Here in this cenote,
one's fallen in, gotten trapped, no way out...
Somehow, some way...
he's succeeded.
They're survivors.
In a changing world, it pays to be a generalist,
not a specialist.
If a big enough asteroid hits Atlas,
the sky grazers and predators would be doomed.
They're too specialized to cope with change.
The generalists are the boneless scavengers.
Like crocodiles, they eat anything...
and live anywhere.
On this imagined high-gravity world,
they could be the great survivors.
How might life adapt
on a different world,
where creatures are trapped
between a searing desert
and a frozen shadowland?
The Earth, home to millions of species.
But what might live... beyond?
Astronomers have discovered thousands of planets
outside our solar system.
They believe there are trillions more.
If life exists on only a fraction of them,
then the universe must be... alive.
All living things have the same needs.
To feed...
reproduce...
and evolve.
By applying the laws of life on Earth
to the rest of the universe...
it's possible to imagine
what could live...
on alien worlds.
Most planets we know of are so hellish,
it seems impossible that anything could live.
But it's amazing where life can take hold.
For as long as I can remember, my mom always told me I was an alien,
because I just had my mind on outer space from the beginning.
I just had alwaysÂ known that I wanted to get out there and explore the universe.
Oh, my God.
This is the most incredible place I think I've ever seen.
This is what I dream other planets looking like.
It's... it's incredible.
So, yeah.
The Danakil Depression is known locally as "The Gateway to Hell."
120 meters below sea level and volcanic...
it's the hottest place on Earth.
We're at 79C. 82C.
This one's topping out at 87.
If life can exist here...
it could exist on any number of worlds in the universe.
Life on other planets, they're gonna have, uh, chemistry.
Whether it looks exactly like ours, we don't know,
but they're gonna have chemistry that helps them live.
And that chemistry is going to be subject to limits.
For example, all life is made up of cells.
Inside these cells they haveÂ biomolecules
that allow the cells to function and live and work.
That's our machinery that runs and makes this chemistry happen,
that keeps life living.
And so we really wanna understand how that machinery works
and what's gonna make that machinery break down.
Until recently, it was assumed
that Danakil was too extreme to support life.
But astrobiologists come hereÂ to look for simple single-celled microbes...
known as extremophiles.
Microbes are too small to see with the naked eye,
so it's not going to be as simpleÂ as taking a little bit of water out of a lake
and putting it under a microscope and seeing lots of teeming bugs.
The only way to detect the presence of extremophiles
is to find traces of their DNA,
using a portable genetic sequencer.
This is a very small device and it's very sensitive to temperature,
and we're in one of the hottest places on the planet Earth.
So, here in the field right now, we do... a cool block,
to kind of keep it cool, and we have our channels running.
And we have...
We have sequencing!
We actually have sequencing happening.
We have DNA in here.
Excellent.
Sequencing of DNA is proof
that extremophiles can survive in the acidic waters of Danakil.
These guys are like the superheroes of microbes, and it's justÂ amazing,
as we learn more and more about the different strategies and mechanisms
that they come up with to survive these kinds of environments.
Finding things alive here opens up an intriguing possibility.
But some life forms are tough enough to survive anywhere...
even in the deepest reaches of space.
A red dwarf star.
The most common type of star in our galaxy.
Imagine a planet in such a close orbit,
its rotation is locked by the star's gravity,
so it always shows the same face to its sun.
This is Janus.
How would life adapt on such an extreme world?
On one side of the planet, it's always daytime,
a searing desert.
On the other side, it's forever night,
a frozen shadowland.
Squeezed between the two, a sliver of perpetual twilight.
Freezing meltwater flows from the cold side,
carving canyons through the landscape.
Even here, where the planet's most hospitable,
there's little vegetation.
But deep in these canyons
lives an extraordinary five-legged creature...
a pentapod.
No bigger than a cat,
it's the dominant life form on Janus,
capable of adapting to any conditions.
On the cold side,
it's stocky and hairy.
On the hot side, it's shiny, slender and skittish.
Pentapods can become whatever they need to be
in order to survive.
On Earth, all animals adapt to fit their environment.
But some are more adaptable than others.
This trail that I just came across here,
it's a beautifully manicured trail,
and you would think it was made by some bigger animal or maybe even a human.
But it's actually made by ants.
The leaf-cutter ant, in particular.
All looks quiet right now,
but if we come back at night, this will actually turn into an ant super-highway,
with leaves just streaming up, like, towards their nest.
Oh, wow.
Look at that.
This is the ant nest.
You can really see into the heart of this colony.
There's a lot going on.
There's actually, for leaf-cutter ants, there's different castes.
There is the soldiers, there are different workers.
There's also the queen.
She's the only one who's laying eggs, and there's only a single queen.
Without her, none of this would be here.
An ant colony depends on the division of labor.
Different castes have different jobs, and they come in all shapes and sizes.
I just grabbed one of the soldiers,
and IÂ also grabbed the really, really small worker.
And it's not the smallest worker in this colony,
but it's-- it's pretty close.
And I mean, the soldiers, I barely can hold her.
It's really hard. I can feel her power.
I can feel she's trying to get out. Her jaws are wide open.
But, I mean, the difference is incredible.
And to think that they all started from the same-- the same larva.
All ants in a colony are closely related.
They share most of the same genes.
But as they grow up, some genes are switched on, others switched off,
depending on the food they are fed.
Any of them can become workers, foragers or soldiers.
So, this ability to create such different shapes and forms from the same blueprint,
this is actually calledÂ polyphenism.
And "poly" just means "many," and "phenism" would be "shapes."
Oh, the spider just did exactly what I was trying to avoid all night.
She walked exactly into oneÂ of these trails of these leaf-cutters here.
And that's not good news.
So here, you really see the power of these soldiers and their jaws.
If something disturbs the colony,
it's their job to come in and get it, and that's exactly what they did.
But wow.
Aaah!
All right, I'm already being attacked.
Ooh, that's gonna hurt.
They are now coming for me.
So, any creature that has this ability to morph
and react to changes in its environment as quickly as ants can do,
has an amazing advantage to not just survive,
but actually dominate its world.
On Janus, pentapods are masters of polyphenism.
Like ants, they're able to develop into different forms.
But they all begin life in the same place...
the Twilight Zone.
A pair of adults is ready to breed.
They're both male and female.
Hermaphrodites.
Each can produce offspring,
doubling their chances of success.
Having mated, a pentapod leaves the shelter of the canyon.
It climbs to high ground,
ready to spawn.
At the top, a constant wind blowsÂ between the cold and hot sides of the planet.
But the wind provides an opportunity to scatter their larvae.
This way, they can colonize the planet.
On the hot side, water is scarce...
condensing only in shaded areas.
If there's nothing to eat, they move on.
With five legs, they can skitter in any direction.
And with ten eyes,
not much escapes their attention.
If they sense a meal,
they use feelers to root it out.
They need to make the most of every opportunity.
Life in any desert is an ordeal.
Only the tough survive.
And in the natural world,
there's nothing much tougher...
than a scorpion.
-Oh. Anything? -Here?
I don't think so.
My first childhood memory of the scorpion,
I was, uh, ten years old and I see this big scorpion.
I screamed "Mom!"
Uh, so she came to my aid
and she was like, "What? What happened?"
And I point to the scorpion, uh, on the ceiling,
I said, "That's gonna eat me."
And she was just like, "No, come on. Be cool. This is just a scorpion."
So, as a cute Mexican mother,
she took, uh... her sandal
and just smashed the, uh, little bastard on the ceiling.
Carlos Santibpez is now an expert on scorpions,
specializing in the study of their venom.
I go at night and I use the UV light,
because UV light makes scorpions glow.
They have a special protein in their shell.
Yeah, let's-- Let's take a look at this one.
- Oh, look at this! - There's a lot of them.
Yeah, this is great.
Scorpions have barely changed in 400 million years.
Perfectly adapted for life in the desert.
Scorpions have a very slow metabolism.
They can spend long periods without food or water.
We have records of some species lasting one year
without eating anything.
And they have just enoughÂ energy
to sustain essential functions to keep them alive.
They need to ensure that the next time food is available,
they catch it.
So, scorpions have developed a lot of weapons that they can use to hunt prey,
including the most important weapon...
venom.
To study scorpion venom,
Carlos needs to extract it from glands in the tail.
Venom is a powerful cocktail that contains minerals, salts
and hundreds of proteins with a different function.
Try to be as fast as you can.
We use electricity to stimulate the muscles.
We're only gonna get small... very small amounts,
a teeny, tiny drop of it.
But this drop is so valuable that we don't wanna lose it.
Give him a nice massage.
Yeah. There's a tiny droplet.
- There. - Oh, yes, it's-- Okay, so it's working.
Uh, we have venom.
It is right there, but it's a teeny, tiny drop.
- Uh... do you see it? - That's right. Yeah.
I mean, it's-- it's like a-- a drop of water.
Venom is such an effective weapon,
it's used by reptiles, insects and fish.
It has evolved, separately, at least 30 times.
The more often a trait like venom has evolved on Earth,
the more likely it is to exist on other planets.
On the hot side of Janus,
pentapods use venom to catch their prey.
But hunting alone is risky.
Even a venomous predator is powerless
against a swarm.
On the cold side of the planet, things are just as tough.
In perpetual darkness and with no energy from the sun...
how can anything survive?
On Earth, nearly all life depends on sunlight.
Plants convert solar energy into food,
which feeds other life forms.
But there are some extraordinary places on Earth
where life has evolved without any light.
When I contemplate going in a cave like this,
one of the things I know is it's an alien environment.
- It's fogging up a little bit. - Yeah.
It is full of good ways to die.
One of the big risks in this cave is there is a lot of hydrogen sulfide.
Hydrogen sulfide can kill you.
- Okay. You ready? - Yeah.
And so my husband comes along to act as a safety officer.
He's not afraid to pull us out and say, "Time to go, you've had enough."
Cueva de Villa Luz is a maze of limestone chambers.
Hydrogen sulfide bubbles up from the Earth's crust.
Mixing with oxygen, it forms sulfuric acid and turns the water milky white.
And yet, some life forms survive,
and even thrive in these conditions.
Snottites...
dripping colonies of bacteria.
There are a lot of organisms in one snottite.
Instead of relying on photosynthesis,
they are eating hydrogen sulfide
and are using it as their energy source.
- Okay, ready to flame? - Yep.
So, make it nice and sterile.
Okay, cap that, please.
Okay, let's go for this one.
Okay.
Okay. One snottite.
These are some of the best snottites in the world.
So acidic.
More acidic than car battery acid.
An entire ecosystem has evolved
to feed off the snottites.
Creatures that have never seen daylight.
Can you see those?
Yes, I do.
So, there's some really big ones over here to the right.
So, whenever you see one of those white streamers of bacteria,
you'll see a fish go after it.
Okay, here comes some more over there. See? Here comes a big one, see?
It's coming. There, it got it!
Studying life in total darkness
has expanded how we look for life in other places in the universe.
It's made us think about the fact
that we could find life in places we never considered.
- Yep, there we go. - 25.
25. It's getting pretty high.
All right.
You think we ought to get out of here?
Yeah.
All life needs some form of energy.
On the hot face of Janus, it comes from starlight.
On the cold face, it comes from deep within.
Geothermal activity.
When volcanic pressure forces water to the surface,
there's a flurry of new life...
which stirs pentapods into action.
They're after grubs that emerge around geothermal pools.
But it's not so easy.
The grubs have evolved a defense.
They jump and flash a warning signal to others...
acting as one to stay alive.
On Earth, some animals use light in the same way...
to send signals.
Every single point of light that you see out there is a firefly.
Right as the sun sets, you'll start to see them come up,
like little sparks rising from a fire.
It's just spectacular, and it only gets better as the night gets darker.
Fireflies flash as a form of communication.
They are among the only land animals
that communicate with light of their own making.
Bioluminescence evolved among fireflies
as a warning to predators
that they're packed with toxins and should be given a wide berth.
Now the same mechanism
is used for finding a mate.
So, the firefly produces light from an organ on its abdomen called the lantern.
And this organ has an enzyme
that produces one photon of light.
This chemical reaction involves oxygen.
So, by controlling the flow of oxygen to their lantern,
they can produce, uh, flashes.
They can turn the chemical reaction on and off,
and use these flashes to communicate with each other.
The males are flying around, and they're doing little advertisements,
little flashes that say, "Here I am. This is me, check me out."
And then the females are waiting on the ground below and they're looking up.
And when they see a guy that they like, they flash back.
And then the male will come over, he'll flash again.
She flashes back and they come together and mate.
So, this is actually one big flirtatious dance
that we're seeing right here behind us.
Each species creates its own little language
that they can use to find each other in the dark.
But using light to communicate is inherently risky.
Some species have evolved to emit fake signals.
What we have here is a predatory Photuris female,
also called femmes fatales, because they have a reputation
for luring in males of other species to eat them.
They can hack in to the communication between a male and a female
and use that to her advantage.
So, you can tell this is a predatory firefly
because her lantern has a different shape to it.
Only two-- two little lines light up, almost like an equals sign.
So, basically, a male will be flying around looking for a mate
and then when the males flash, they flash back,
just as if they were a female of that species.
So, they're imitating the females of that other species
to get the male to come over,
but they don't wanna mate with that male...
she wants to eat that male.
And she proceeds to do so in an extremely violent way.
This is a classic example of a predator using mimicry.
One species copying the behavior of another...
in order to kill it.
Lying and deceit is...
is pretty widespread in the animal kingdom, I would say.
And I think it would be on any planet.
On Janus, the grubs use light to stay alive.
But their system is about to be hacked.
By catching a few grubs, the pentapods absorb theirÂ bioluminescence...
and mimic their warning signals.
The grubs instinctively jump away from flashing lights.
But this time, it's a trap.
The pentapods have them where they want them.
Again, adaptability is the secret to their survival.
But for all creatures on Janus,
existence depends on one key ingredient...
whether in the hot, cold or twilight worlds.
Water.
Everybody knows the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears.
She sneaks into their house and tries to eat their porridge.
The first bowl is too hot.
The second bowl is freezing cold.
It's only when she tries the third bowl that she's happy.
"This one," Goldilocks says, "is just right."
When we look around the universe in the search for life,
we are looking for conditions that are "just right."
And "just right," in this case,
is defined by the presence of this stuff.
Water.
Water transports the essentials for life around the planet
and around every living body.
It's the most important substance in the universe.
Because water is so familiar to us,
it's not until you really stop and think about it that you realize how weird it is.
Water is made up by one oxygen atom...
and two hydrogen atoms.
And because of the nature of the elements and the way they're bound,
we have a net negative charge at the oxygen side
and positive on the two hydrogens.
This means that every hydrogen in a molecule
can interact with the oxygen on the other molecules neighboring.
Replicate this attraction for billions of neighboring molecules
and you get a substance that is very sticky.
And water molecules don't just attract each other,
they attract almost any other molecule they come in contact with.
They pull other substances apart,
break them down, and dissolve them.
Water is the universal solvent
because of its unique ability to dissolve nutrients and chemicals.
It seems certain the first spark of life on Earth happened not on land...
but in water.
Deep underwater, in the primordial oceans,
the chemical ingredients for life were swirling around.
What was needed was a place to concentrate these ingredients...
to allow the chemical reaction that would eventually lead to life.
That place could have been a hydrothermal vent.
Water interacts with hot rocks deep underground.
It comes gushing back up into the freezing seawater
carrying nutrients and chemicals...
little bubbles of life.
The link between water and life is so strong,
it's hard to imagine any life anywhere in the universe
existing without it.
It's mind-boggling to think,
you know, how life can find a way in very extreme places.
Very hot, very cold.
And at the end, it's all about the water.
If there's liquid water, you'll find life.
Water on Janus is scarce.
It either freezes as ice...
or evaporates into the wind.
But there's just enough liquid water
for life to take hold...
and for the toughest of creatures
to adapt and survive.
At NASA, they have a saying.
"If you want to find life...
follow the water."
How might life adapt on a different world?
One with two stars,
where there's more energy than on Earth.
Trash. Junk. Trash.
Ooh!
More trash.
Huh?
Aw, itai! Aw!
Pain. My old friend.
Huh?
Hello.
Kiko.
Hey!
I am Baymax, your personal healthcare...
What's that? Borax?
I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.
I was alerted to the need for medical attention when you said...
-"Aw, itai! Aw!" -Wasn't me.
On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate your pain?
I love all my pain equally.
That is not a valid answer.
-I will scan you now. -Huh?
Scan me?
Scan complete. There is degradation of your joint cartilage,
primarily affecting the area of your hips.
Compliments will get you nowhere.
I suggest pain medication in conjunction with daily exercise.
I will find the nearest recreational facility,
using my state-of-the-art GPS locate...
Found it.
Swimming is an ideal form of physical therapy for someone with your...
I don't swim.
It can be more encouraging to swim with a friend or family member.
Great, I'll call everyone I know.
I detected a spike in your cortisol level when I mentioned swimming.
Do you have a fear of water?
You got it.
Then we first must address your water phobia.
I will implement a psychological treatment called "exposure."
I'm trying to slam the door.
Slowly introducing you to elements you fear
until you are comfortable swimming.
Toodaloo, balloon man.
What the...
Congratulations, Kiko.
You have taken your first step in overcoming your fear of water.
You have earned a lollipop.
Hello, Kiko.
Sounds of water can help you fight your fear.
It's time to pop that bounce house.
Thanks.
I will scan you now.
Scan complete.
You are in good health.
Huh?
Where is he?
Oh.
Oh!
I got you now, Borax. Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Ha!
Congratulations, Kiko.
You have taken a major step in facing your fear.
Oh, no.
No. You shouldn't have brought me here.
I need to go home.
Water is nothing to be afraid of, Kiko.
Water therapy is proven to ease joint pain.
You don't understand.
I was never afraid of water.
It's this place.
The memories.
Look at my ridiculous husband.
He used to swim at this old rundown pool
all the time.
Splashing around like a porpoise with swim trunks.
He would say, "Jump in, Kiko. Live a little."
I got close a couple of times, but...
never took the leap.
I wish I had.
You are in good health, Kiko,
therefore, it is not too late...
to live a little.
-Are you ready? -Whoo!
I think so.
Whoo-hoo!
Baymax, have you been swimming?
More like...
floating.
Looks like another busy day, ain't it, Mochi?
Simon?
-Thanks. -Thank you.
Refill. Coming in hot.
-Thanks, Cass. -How's the novel coming?
Pretty good-ish.
-I see a new haircut. -You noticed?
Ooh!
-How's the muffin? -Really good.
Agnes.
Jorge.
Morning, Cass. Doing anything fun this weekend?
Sayaka, the cafe is all the fun I need...
Ow!
My ankle.
Are you all right?
Oh, no. I don't have time for this.
Be cool. Here he comes.
What's happening?
Hello. I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.
Oh, Baymax.
You good?
We're all great down here.
I was alerted to the need for medical attention
when you said, "Ow, my ankle."
Who said, "Ow"? I didn't say, "Ow". Did you say, "Ow"?
- This is nuts. - I will scan you now.
-No, no, no. -Scan complete.
You have sprained your ankle.
Yeah.
My cryo spray will help keep the swelling down.
You don't understand.
I have to run the cafe.
Going back to work could cause further injury
to the anterior talofibular ligament in your foot.
I suggest closing the cafe for 5-7 days to allow your ankle to heal properly.
I'm not closing the Lucky Cat over a little sprained ankle.
I have customers waiting, as we speak.
What are you downloading?
I am downloading information on how to run a small business.
And why would you do that?
Your concern over the cafe is causing you stress,
which can greatly hinder the healing process.
To help you relax, I will manage the cafe.
You can't just download what took me years to learn.
Download complete.
Baymax, are...
Are you sure you can run things down there?
My customers are very important to me.
Do not worry about the cafe, Cass.
Everything will be fine.
We are going to need eyes on this, Mochi.
Okay, there we go.
And it works.
Hiro's not the only one with techie skills.
What is that?
What am I looking at? Is that a...
Mochi!
That's it.
That's it. Good boy, Mochi.
What is he doing?
Wait, wait! No, no, no!
Go back! Go back!
Don't play with that. Mochi! No.
Aw!
Well, I guess I'm doing this myself.
Steve.
Oh, boy, this is a disaster.
Shh!
-Your banana. -Thanks, Cass.
Is everything okay?
Oh, yeah. Never better.
Wh...
Hmm?
Hi there.
Wait, wait... I just have to get one more thing.
Baymax! Stop.
This is not working.
I agree.
You keep coming downstairs.
Not me, you.
You're not giving my customers the service they need.
I'm sorry. If you won't do it, I will,
and nothing's gonna stop me...
Oh, no.
Yeah.
My objective of running the cafe to aid in your healing
seems to have caused you further injury.
Oh, Baymax, this isn't your fault.
I did this to myself.
I should have just closed the cafe like you said.
It's just...
I made a promise to take care of this family,
and there is no promise without those customers.
I'm afraid if I don't stay open, they'll just...
find another place to go.
They may find other cafes,
but they will not find another Cass.
Think you can give me a lift downstairs?
Warning. Storage almost full.
- Hmm? - Warning. Storage almost full.
Oh, my gosh. Has Mochi been recording this whole time?
Hey, Mochi.
What you got there?
Some kind of spy cam.
That's Cass's.
Cass, are you using Mochi to spy on Baymax?
Yeah. She's totally spying on him.
Hey, Cass, you don't need to worry.
Baymax is slow, but he's getting the job done.
Your job is to just get better.
-Is that Cass? -We miss you.
Feel better!
We love you.
You take the time to heal, Cass.
- We'll be here when you're ready. - We love you, Cass.
Hey, Baymax.
Cass said you ran the cafe all day.
Coffee. Scones. Expresso. More coffee.
Employee of the month.
Way to go, Baymax.
Refills.
My name is Walter Hartwell White.
I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane,
Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.
To all law enforcement entitles, this is not an admission of guilt.
I am speaking to my family now.
Skyler...
you are the love of my life.
I hope you know that.
Walter, Junior...
you're my big man.
There are...
There are going to be some...
things... things...
that you'll come to learn about me in the next few days.
I just want you to know
that no... no matter how it may look,
I only had you in my heart.
Good-bye.
Happy Birthday.
Look at that.
That is veggie bacon.
Believe it or not. Zero cholesterol.
You won't even taste the difference.
What time do you think you'll be home?
Same time.
I don't want him dicking you around tonight.
You get paid till 5, you work till 5, no later.
Hey.
- Happy Birthday. - Well, thank you.
You're late... again.
There was no hot water... again.
I have an easy fix for that.
You wake up early,
and then you get to be the first person in the shower.
I have an idea.
How about buy a new hot water heater?
How's that idea?
For the millionth and billionth time.
- Did you take your Echinacea? - Yeah.
I think it's getting better.
What the hell is this?
It's veggie bacon. We're watching our cholesterol, I guess.
Not me. I want real bacon.
Not this fake crap.
Too bad.
Eat it.
This smells like Band-aids.
Eat... it.
So, how's it feel to be old?
How does it feel to be a smart ass?
Good.
Eat your veggie bacon.
- You all set? - Yeah, I'm fine.
- All right, see you at home. - Okay, see you.
Chemistry.
It is the study of what?
Anyone?
Ben.
- Chemicals. - Chemicals!
No!
Chemistry is...
Well, technically,
chemistry is the study of matter.
But I prefer to see it as the study of change.
Now just... just think about this.
Electrons.
They...
change their energy levels.
Molecules.
Molecules change their bonds.
Elements.
They combine and change into compounds.
Well, that's... that's all of life.
Right? I mean, it's just... It's the constant.
It's the cycle. It's solution,
dissolution, just over and over and over.
It is growth, then decay, then transformation.
It is fascinating, really.
Chad...
Is there something wrong with your table?
Okay. Ionic bonds...
Are you done?
Ionic bonds.
Chapter 6.
And 2, 3 makes 10, and 10 makes 20.
Here's your receipt,
and hand this claiming disc to your car wash professional.
Thank you. Come again.
He's not coming.
He said he quits.
I'm gonna run the register.
Bogdan, no. We talked about this.
I'm shorthanded, Walter.
What am I to do?
Walter?
What am I to do?
Hey, Mr. White!
Make those tires shine, huh?
Oh, my God.
You would not believe who's cleaning Chad's car.
Mr. White...
from Chemistry.
Surprise!
Happy Birthday, Dad!
You're so very late.
Really, I'm serious, Skyler.
I mean, you're flat as a washboard.
You look awesome.
She's not showing at all, is she?
She's showing a little.
Carmen, this is my sister Marie.
- Pleased to meet you. - Hi.
Glock 22. It's my daily carry, okay?
I mean, unless you're talking, what, plus, B-plus loads,
you can forget the 9-mil, all right?
I seen one of those bounce off a windshield one time.
Yeah, the way you shoot.
If you're gonna bring a gun,
you gotta bring enough gun.
.40 caliber.
- This is awesome right here. - Nice, isn't it?
Dad, come check this out.
- Yeah, I see it. - Come on, take it.
Check it out, Walt.
No, no, it's just heavy.
That's why they hire men.
It's not gonna bite you, all right?
Looks like Keith Richards with a glass of warm milk, doesn't he?
Hey, Walt. Everybody listen up, listen up, listen up!
I'm gonna give a toast.
A little toast to my brother-in-law. Come here.
Walt, you got a brain the size of Wisconsin,
but we're not gonna hold that against you.
Because your heart's in the right place, man.
Your heart's in the right place.
We love you, man. We love you.
Everybody! To Walt!
Na zdorovje!
Na zdorovje!
Hey, turn on Channel 3.
At which point we apprehended three individuals
and placed them into custody.
I'm proud to say the outstanding
professionalism of my fellow agents
at the Albuquerque District Office
resulted in a substantial amount
of methamphetamine being taken off the streets.
Were any shots fired?
No, ma'am. Our agents took the suspects by surprise.
Damn, the TV does add ten pounds.
Ten pounds?
Hey, sit and spin. Both of you.
- Hank. - What?
Sorry. You didn't see that.
So charming.
This is clearly an ongoing operation,
one which was well organized...
Hank, how much money is that?
It's about 700 grand. That's a pretty good haul, huh?
As I say, it's a good day for the citizens of Albuquerque
when we can put this big a dent in the local drug trade.
But that's unusual, isn't it, that kind of cash?
Well, it's not the most we ever took.
It's easy money...
until we catch you.
Walt, just say the word and I'll take you on a ride-along.
You can watch us knock down a meth lab.
Get a little excitement in your life.
Well, someday.
Which one's this?
That faux-Lalique vase
I picked up at the Super-Swap.
How's it doing?
I met my reserve,
and there's still two minutes.
What's up?
You tell me, birthday boy.
Oh, hey, so what's up for Saturday?
Car wash.
Bogdan says he needs me.
Until what time? Noon? 1-ish?
Probably 2, more like it.
And then what after that?
Actually...
I was thinking of driving
up to Los Alamos.
The visitor center has an exhibit on...
It's really supposed to be...
- You're not gonna paint? - I'll paint.
It's just that this...
part of this exhibition on the...
Mars Rover photographs are...
The detail really is just supposed to be amazing.
It's just that I really need you to paint at some point.
I mean, the sooner that back bedroom gets finished.
And I'd do it myself, except you said you don't want me
- standing on the stepladder. - I'll paint. I will paint.
What is going on down there?
- No, it's just... - Is he asleep?
No, It's nothing. You know, just...
You know,
we gotta be careful about the baby.
Don't worry about the baby. This is just for you.
We are just doing you tonight.
So just close your eyes.
Relax, and let it...
- Close your eyes. - Okay.
There you go.
That's it.
That's it.
There you go.
Keep it going.
Keep it going.
Keep it going.
Keep... Yes!
56!
This is so embarrassing.
I am fine. Honestly.
It's just some bug going around.
First my wife had it, then my son, and now me.
It's just like a chest cold.
Could be some low blood sugar as well.
I didn't have the greatest breakfast this morning, honestly.
Hey, listen, can you do me a favor? Can you just...
drop me off at a corner somewhere?
No. Sorry.
It's just that I don't have the greatest insurance.
Take a couple of deep breaths for me.
Is there anybody you want us to contact for you?
God, no.
Lean forward for me, would you?
Mr. White, are you a smoker?
No. Never.
Why do you ask?
Mr. White.
Mr. White?
Yes.
You understood what I've just said to you?
Yes.
Lung cancer. Inoperable.
I'm sorry...
I just need to make sure you fully understand.
Best-case scenario, with chemo,
I'll live maybe another couple years.
It's just...
you've got mustard on your...
Right there. Mustard, there.
Right there.
So my records show that I paid it,
and I certainly don't feel that we owe any late...
All right.
Well, I'll check with the bank
and maybe the post office,
if they lost it or something.
Yeah, let me look into that.
Okay.
Thank you.
Did you use the MasterCard last month?
15.88 at Staples?
We needed printer paper.
Walt, the MasterCard's the one we don't use.
Okay.
So how was your day?
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know. It was, um...
It was fine.
Come on. I'm shorthanded. I need you to do some wipe-downs.
- Come on. - What?
I said I need you outside to do some wipe-downs.
Are you here to work or to be staring at the skies?
Come on, let's go.
Come on, man.
- Fuck you, Bogdan. - What?
I said fuck you!
And your eyebrows!
Wipe down this!
Uh, Hank.
Hank, it's Walt. Hey.
Oh, listen... I didn't wake you, did I?
Oh, good, good.
No, no, nothing's wrong. I just, uh...
I've been, uh, thinking about that offer...
that ride-along.
It's the last house on the right. See it?
Not the two-story one. The one next to it.
The kind of... I don't know, what do you call that?
- Green? - Sage.
Sage.
What, do you work at the fucking Pottery Barn?
Sage. That's the word for it.
My fault the only word your dumb ass knows is green?
Cheese dick.
I know that one. How 'bout that?
Anyway, it's the sage one. See it?
So what tells you it's a meth lab?
Star snitch says some dude
goes by Cap'n Cook lives up to his name in there.
Says he always adds a dash of chili powder.
Ah, you exuberant Mexicans.
Captain Cook, that's a white boy's name.
Dopey as hell, too.
Yeah? Tell you what.
I got 20 bucks that says he's a beaner.
- All right. - You're on.
All right, come on, come on.
All right. School bus is clear. Got the green light.
Copy that.
Watch this. This makes 'em shit.
Go, go, go.
Meth labs are nasty on a good day.
You mix that wrong, you got mustard gas.
Phosphine gas.
I think.
Yeah, exactly.
One whiff will kill you. That's why the respirators.
House is clear. One suspect in custody.
Copy that.
The suspect, might he be of the Latino persuasion?
Driver's license says Emilio Koyama.
Asian!
Pay up, sucker.
First name Emilio.
That's at least half a beaner.
Tell you what, I'll let you off for a 10.
Cheer up, Gomey. You people still got J. Lo.
Hank, do you think I might get to go inside?
See the actual lab?
Yeah. Yeah, I tell you what,
we're gonna go peek our heads in,
check it out first.
Stay here a minute.
God.
Oh, my God.
Pinkman?
It's me.
I'm alone.
How'd you find me?
You're still in our filing system.
So your aunt owns this place, right?
I own it.
No one's looking for you.
Why are you here?
I was curious.
Honestly, I never expected you
to amount to much, but methamphetamine?
I didn't picture that.
There's a lot of money in it, huh?
I don't know what you're talking about.
- No? - Not a clue.
Cap'n Cook?
That's not you?
Like I said, no one is looking for you.
Look, I don't know what you think you're doing here, Mr. White.
I mean, if you're planning on giving me some bowl winder
about getting right with Jesus by turning myself in...
- Not really. - High school was a long time ago.
You ain't Welcome Back Kotter, so step off.
No speeches.
Short speech.
You lost your partner today. What's his name?
Emilio?
Emilio is going to prison.
The DEA took all your money, your lab.
You got nothing.
Square 1.
But you know the business.
And I know the chemistry.
I'm thinking...
maybe you and I could partner up.
You want to cook crystal meth?
You?
You and, uh... and me?
That's right.
Either that...
or I turn you in.
What the hell is this?
Damned if I know.
I described it as mosaic folk art.
- Somebody bought it? - Yeah, some guy in Minneapolis.
$14.00 plus shipping.
Yes!
At this rate, in 50 or 60 years, you'll be rich.
So how goes the novel?
It's not a novel, actually, which I have...
You're not writing a novel? You told me you were.
No. Short stories.
I said that if eventually I have enough good ones
that maybe I'll try and...
publish another collection.
Those really didn't sell.
I just thought a novel would be easier to sell.
Yeah, well, maybe so.
Ever want me to read anything, I could critique it for you.
No.
I mean, I'm not at that stage where I...
No.
Open offer.
So what's up with Walt lately?
What do you mean? He's fine.
He just seems, I don't know...
quieter than usual.
Turning 50 is a big deal.
I mean, I'm sure as hell not looking forward to 40.
You're gonna be a complete basket case.
So it's mid-life crisis.
No, he's just quiet.
- How's the sex? - Marie, Jesus.
Guess that answers that.
You just gonna sit there?
This. Look at this.
Kjeldahl-style recovery flask,
800 milliliters. Very rare.
You got your usual paraphernalia:
Griffin beakers, your Erlenmeyer flask.
But the pièce de résistance:
a round bottom boiling flask. 5,000 milliliters.
Well, I cook in one of those.
The big one.
One of these?
No, this is a volumetric flask. You wouldn't cook in one of these.
Yeah, I do.
No, you don't.
A volumetric flask is for general mixing and titration.
You wouldn't apply heat to a volumetric flask.
That's what a boiling flask is for.
Did you learn nothing from my chemistry class?
No. You flunked me.
- Remember? - No wonder.
Prick.
Now let me tell you something else. This ain't chemistry,
this is art.
Cooking is art.
And the shit I cook is the bomb, so don't be telling me.
The shit you cook is shit.
I saw your setup. Ridiculous.
You and I will not make garbage.
We will produce a chemically pure
and stable product that performs as advertised.
No adulterants. No baby formula. No chili powder.
No, no, chili P is my signature.
Not anymore.
Yeah, well, we'll see about that.
- What the hell is this? - Lab safety equipment.
We're also gonna have an emergency eye wash station.
These chemicals and their fumes are toxic,
in case you didn't know that.
Well, you can dress up like a faggot if you want.
Not me.
Listen, this stuff doesn't stay more than a day.
What? I thought we were gonna cook here.
No, we're not gonna cook here.
Okay, this is my house. I don't shit where I eat.
Well, then, where are we gonna work?
You tell me.
This is your deal.
You want to smoke it up, smoke it up at your house.
Nah, I didn't think so.
Oh, well.
Well...
what if we rented one of those self-storage places,
you know, those little orange garages, worked out of there?
No.
They're on to that. They got dogs that sniff around.
RV. That's what you want.
What, like a Winnebago?
Yeah.
I know a dude who wants to sell his.
He just goes camping with it.
But a mobile meth lab?
That'd be the bomb. I mean,
drive way out in the boonies.
Be all evasive.
Dude, this isn't even 7 grand. My guy wants 85.
This is all the money I have in the world.
You're a drug dealer. Negotiate.
You are not how I remember you from class,
I mean, like, not at all.
- I gotta go. - Wait, wait. Hold on.
Tell me why you're doing this.
Seriously.
Why do you do it?
Money, mainly.
- There you go. - Nah, come on!
Man, some straight like you, giant stick up his ass,
all of a sudden at age, what, 60,
he's just gonna break bad?
- I'm 50. - It's weird is all, okay?
It doesn't compute. Listen...
if you've gone crazy or something...
I mean, if you've... if you've gone crazy
or depressed, I'm just saying...
that's something I need to know about.
Okay? I mean, that affects me.
I am awake.
What?
Buy the RV.
We start tomorrow.
How's it coming in there?
Fine.
Do you want me or your dad?
Dad.
So how are those feeling in the waist? Are they too tight?
'Cause you don't want to get 'em if they're too tight.
They're pre-shrunk.
Are you sure you don't want to get a different kind.
Like, you know, the skinny jeans?
Those are really supposed to be in style now.
The skaters wear them.
Do I look like a skater?
All right.
Mom, look at my big-boy pants.
Mommy, could you zip up my big-boy pants?
- Don't. - What?
Don't.
Walt.
- Where... - I have no idea.
You know what? Don't even look at them.
They're obviously very stupid.
Yep.
I think that, um...
I think those jeans look really good on you.
You should get 'em if you like 'em, okay?
Why don't you just hang out here for a second?
I'll be right back.
Fine.
Mommy, I think I pinched a loaf in my brand-new big-boy pants.
- What are you doing? - What's wrong, chief?
Having a little trouble walking?
Get off me. Get off me!
I'll mess you up, man.
Well, you'll have one shot. You better make it good.
What, are you waiting for your girlfriends?
You better go. Take it.
Take your shot. Take it!
Come on. Come on.
- Come on, let's get outta here. - Let's go.
Psycho.
Yeah, nothing but cows!
Got some big cow house way out that way, like 2 miles,
but I don't see nobody.
Cow house?
Yeah, where they live.
The cows.
Whatever, man.
Yeah, let's cook here.
Cow house.
God help me.
What are you doing?
These are my good clothes.
I can't go home smelling like a meth lab.
Yeah, you can. I do.
Those?
Those, uh... You're keeping those on, right?
Come on.
Daylight's burning.
Oh, my God.
Oh, this is, uh... this is a good look for you.
And you're maybe only the world's second biggest homo.
Would you shut up and help me?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, work it.
Baby, work it.
Turn that off!
This is glass grade.
I mean, you got...
Jesus, you got crystals in here 2 inches, 3 inches long.
This is pure glass.
You're a damn artist.
This is art, Mr. White.
Actually, it's just basic chemistry,
but thank you, Jesse. I'm glad it's acceptable.
Acceptable? You're the goddamn Iron Chef.
Every jibbhead from here to Timbuktu is going to want a taste.
Now I gotta... I gotta try this.
No. No.
No, we only sell it. We don't use it.
Okay, since when?
Listen, you've been watching way too much Miami Vice.
That ain't happening.
So... what now?
How do we proceed?
We cook more tomorrow.
Meantime...
I know just the guy to talk to.
Kraze, how you doing, my man?
You got a new dog. Right on, man.
What's his name?
Yeah, I had a dog like that once,
except maybe, like, twice as big.
Super purebred.
Now, me personally, I would train him to go straight for the nuts...
Just shut your mouth and show me your money.
I ain't buying, ese.
I'm selling.
Tell me that ain't the finest scante
you ever laid eyes on.
Go ahead, try it.
Hey, poochie.
How you doing?
Jesus Christ.
See? What'd I say?
- It's all right. - It's all right? It's all right?
- Yeah, it's all right. - So, what? You back in business?
Hell, yeah, I'm back.
With a vengeance.
Vato loco gotta make a living.
You know, with your cousin gone away and all.
And listen, homes, about that.
It really broke me up about Emilio.
That dude is like my brother.
He okay? You talk to him?
Yeah, yeah, I talked to him.
He said when the Feds came, you were out
sticking it in some neighbor lady.
Hey, you know, I got lucky twice.
I don't know, man.
Emilio...
He thinks maybe you dimed on him.
That is bullshit.
That is bullshit, Krazy-8!
I should kick his punk ass for even thinking that.
You know what? Next time you talk to Emilio,
you tell him for me, all right?
Why don't you tell him yourself?
- Made bail this morning. - Go ahead, pendejo.
Kick my ass.
Hey, listen...
Where did you get this?
Because I know your little punk ass didn't cook it.
Hey, man.
You some kind of nudist?
That's some stone-fine tick tick you been cooking there, ese.
How about you come work for me?
I'd be willing to sell it to you if...
the price is right.
You out here all by yourself, huh?
I know you.
He was there when I got busted. He's with the DEA!
No.
You ratasnitch motherfucker!
Run, Mr. White! Run!
I say we cap 'em both.
Hey, you really cook up that batch?
Yeah.
You an artist.
It's a damn shame.
Wait! Wait a minute.
Listen to me.
I'll teach you my recipe.
What do you say? You want to cook like me?
You let us both live...
and I will teach you.
Put the cigarette out.
Please.
Move it, homes.
We ain't got all day.
Okay.
What happened?
What'd you do to them?
Red phosphorus in the presence of moisture
and accelerated by heat yields phosphorus hydride.
Phosphine gas.
One good whiff and...
We gotta...
We gotta... clean this up.
Where were you?
Walt.
I don't know what's been going on with you lately, but...
Nothing. I'm fine.
Whatever it is...
I'll tell you this.
I do not like it when you don't talk to me.
The worst thing you can do is shut me out.
Walter, is that you?
Are you okay?
- You are a life saver. - Yeah, man.
- We can't thank you enough. - Hey, mad props.
I could have sworn the guy said south.
But then, all of a sudden we're off the main road.
I'm trying to read the map while I'm driving, which is a bonehead maneuver.
And all of a sudden... Bam, we're in that ditch.
Yeah, bam, I'm like, what the hell? You know?
Yes, and my coffee mug.
Coffee? My mug of coffee?
It spills all over my pants. I mean, just... a nightmare.
Dude, you so need GPS. I mean, for real.
Like I said,
we couldn't be more grateful.
Can't we just dump 'em here?
What, then somebody finds them?
Then what? People have seen us.
You're gonna flood it, man.
I'm not gonna flood it. She's not gonna flood, all right?
We're just gonna stay positive, right?
We're going to clean up this mess. Wish you would start.
Damn it. See? You flooded it.
All right. All right. You know what?
The RV is going to start now.
The RV is going to start right now.
It's gonna start and we're gonna drive it over to your house.
- My house? - Yes.
We'll drive it over there and park it overnight.
- And then tomorrow... - No, man, not my house!
Shut up!
After we finish cleaning up this mess,
we will go our separate ways.
Our paths will never cross.
And we will tell this to no one.
Understood?
What, I can talk now?
Fine.
That goes double for me.
Be good to me.
Oh, shit.
Walt?
You coming out?
Yeah, absolutely.
You wanna hear something funny?
We had a faculty meeting last Thursday
and the topic was senior class photos,
and how we had instituted a new rule last year
that seniors are allowed to
have photos taken by a photographer of their choice,
Not necessarily the photographer that the school hires, right? So...
Anyway, some of the senior girls
were going to that...
Glamour Shots place, to have their photos taken,
and now they're bringing us all these photos,
and Joan Epperman, you know Joan,
suddenly has to go through all these photos
and turn them down, because they show cleavage.
Did you get enough pancakes, sweetie?
Yeah. I'm good.
You know, even these small-busted girls... have cleavage.
Apparently there's some new type of brassiere,
or something.
The Wonderbra...
It's the Wonderbra.
Hey, there. You've reached Walt, Skyler and Walter, Junior.
We can't come to the phone right now, so please leave us a message.
Hello, Mr. White. This is AT&T calling.
Are you happy with your current long distance service?
'Cause if you're not, I would definitely, really
love to talk to you as soon as possible about...
Hello? Hello. This is Walter White speaking.
You said he was practically dead, okay?
You said he would die any minute!
Listen, I am having breakfast with my family right now,
and I really don't appreciate these sales calls.
Well, too bad, man, 'cause guess what.
He's still not dead!
I went and put my ear to the RV, I can hear him, like,
rolling around in there, all right?
I think he's awake, man, I think he's trying to get loose.
Where the hell are you? I'm freaking out over here!
- Calm down, damn it. - Are you gonna help me clean this up?
- We got loose ends here! - Calm down!
I will be there after school.
After school? Are you shitting me?
Ditch it, man, call in sick.
Listen, that is just not going to work for me.
I'm not interested in that at all.
And I would appreciate if you don't call here anymore.
Damn. They're so annoying, those people.
- You have a good day, sweetie. - Okay, Mom. You too.
Bye, honey.
- Drive safe. - Okay.
Yo, yo, yo, 148-3369,
representing the ABQ.
What up, biatch?
Leave it at the tone.
So, the term "chiral"
derives from the Greek word "hand."
The concept here being that, just as your left hand,
and your right hand are mirror images of one another, right?
Identical, and yet opposite.
Well, so too organic compounds can exist as
mirror image forms
of one another all the way down at the molecular level.
But although they may look the same,
they don't always behave the same.
For instance...
I'm sorry... For instance...
Thalidomide.
The right-handed isomer of the drug Thalidomide
is a perfectly fine good medicine to give to a pregnant woman
to prevent morning sickness but,
make the mistake of giving that same pregnant woman
the left-handed isomer of the drug Thalidomide,
and her child will be born with
horrible birth defects.
Which is precisely what happened in the 1950s.
So, chiral, chirality,
mirrored images, right?
Active, inactive.
Good, bad.
Yes, Ben?
Is this gonna be on the murder?
What?
Is this gonna be on the mid-term?
The chirality on the mid-term? No, no, well, maybe,
maybe, yes, you know, but prepare
for it to be on the mid-term.
Can't hurt to know it, right?
Knowledge is power!
Oh, no, no...
Not good. Not good.
What the...
Hey, you.
Listen... No, no, no, no!
Oh, God!
MILF's?
What the hell is a MILF?
Now what?
The other one, out in the RV, he's...
- You're sure? - Yes.
Positive?
- Feel free to go check it yourself. - Yes, good idea.
Maybe I should do that before he, too, wanders off on the damn street!
- Okay, you know what, I... - All right, all right!
The one downstairs, tell me about him.
Come on, anything, something!
- Start with his name, at least! - Krazy-8.
Krazy-8? What the hell does that even mean?
I don't know, man, okay? I mean, he's like,
Krazy-8, okay? I don't know.
So, you work with him regularly?
No, not him so much.
- His cousin, mainly. - Who's his cousin?
- The guy out in the RV! - All right, all right.
Krazy-8's one level higher.
One level higher?
Yeah, you know, not like street level.
Higher.
You know, there's like a Starbucks at every corner?
Krazy-8 is, like, the dude that sells Starbucks his beans.
Okay, so he's a distributor.
Okay, so, is he...
I mean, is he... In other words...
What is his reputation for violence?
Well, um...
He did try to kill us both yesterday, so there's that.
What I'm trying to say is that he's a distributor, right?
He's a... He's a businessman, he's a man of business.
It would therefore seem to follow that he is capable of acting
out of mutual self-interest, yes?
What?
Do you think he is capable
of listening to reason?
What kind of reason?
Like "Dear Krazy-8, listen,
"if I let you go, will you promise not to come back and waste my family?
"No Colombian neckties." You mean that kind of reason?
No, man, I can't say as I have high hopes where that's concerned.
What was that?
What was what?
Come see!
We gotta tie him up.
Why the hell didn't we tie him up?
Because he was out cold.
But what if he's faking it?
Like if it was me, I'd be all faking being knocked out, yo!
And then, when the coast is clear,
I'd be up looking for weapons and shit,
waiting to pounce!
Now if it was me, and I couldn't find a decent enough weapon,
I would just lie back down, and bide my time.
So now what do we do?
You keep asking me that
like you think I have some answer.
- Well, you gotta do something! - We!
We have got to do something, and I am opened to suggestions.
Man, uh-uh, okay, this whole thing was your deal!
Don't you dare put that on me!
You brought those guys out there, this is your responsability!
Like I came to you, begging to cook meth.
"Nerdiest old dude I know, you wanna come cook crystal?" Please!
"I'd ask my diaper-wearing granny, but her wheelchair wouldn't fit in the RV."
What about the... the phosphate gas?
Phosphine gas. What about it?
I mean, do you think it still might kill him?
You know, with like a delayed reaction or something?
I don't know.
- You're supposed to be a scientist! - Look!
This isn't even the issue that demands immediate attention.
We have got a body in that RV,
and it's getting warmer outside, understand?
And we have got to do something about that soon.
And in a way that no one will ever find it.
Now that last part
is very, very important.
Therefore,
it seems to me that our best course of action
would be chemical disincorporation.
Dissolving in strong acid.
Oh man, that's messed up.
You're not... You're not serious?
You're serious?
Who's gonna do that?
And don't look at me!
I guess we'll both do it together.
No, Mr. White, okay, I'm not good with dead bodies.
We're in this 50/50, okay?
I guess the only other fair way
to go about this would be...
that one of us deals with the...
body situation, while the other one of us...
deals with the Krazy-8 situation.
In a scenario like this,
I don't suppose it is bad form to just...
flip a coin.
- Heads or tails? - I'll do the body in the acid, okay?
Heads or tails?
Heads.
Best two out of three?
Yo, yo, yo, 148-3369,
representing the ABQ.
What up, biatch?
Leave it at the tone.
Mr. White, it's me, pick up.
I got a container question.
Hello? Mr. White, pick up the phone, man!
Yes?
What kind of plastic, man?
Polyethylene.
How the hell am I supposed to know that?
Because I told you.
Look, just...
look at the bottom for a triangle
stamped "LDPE."
It should be molded right into the plastic.
Yeah, yeah, LDPE. Right on, got it.
But... I don't know, man, this feels kind of flimsy.
Any decent acid's gonna eat right through this.
- Not hydrofluoric. - Why not?
Look, you skipped,
clowned around or otherwise jerked off
to every lecture I ever gave.
As far as I'm concerned, your chemistry education is over.
Oh, okay. Be a dick about it.
So, hey, have you...
Have you done the thing?
Yeah, I'm working up to it.
You know what? I bet he doesn't even wake up.
Not even if you took him to the hospital right now.
Now, if it was me, I would just try and think of it like I was...
I was doing him a favor.
Who's there?
Don't you fucking play games with me. Who's there?
Yeah, I see you.
What are you gonna do?
I need water!
Bring me some water, would you?
Please?
You don't like the crust?
Where's my cousin Emilio?
He dead?
Hey, Mr. White!
Mr. White?
Are you smoking weed?
Oh, my God!
Wait a minute. Is that my weed?
What the hell, man?
Make yourself at home, why don't you?
So what did you end up buying?
Nothing.
No store in town sells a plastic bin big enough for a body.
I don't suppose you could buy two bins...
Legs in one, torso in the other?
God.
I don't suppose you could kiss my ass?
How did it go?
So you didn't do it?
Not yet.
God.
- I gotta go. - What? No, come back here!
Sorry. I'll do it tomorrow, I promise.
Tomorrow?
I've got a doctor's appointement, I gotta go.
Look, stay away from him.
He's awake.
Hey, man, we flipped a coin.
We flipped a coin!
We're good?
We're very good.
We're excellent, I'd say.
Oh, would you look at that face!
Smile, peanut!
So, who's up for knowing?
Girl.
Girl?
- You sure? - Pretty sure.
Can I tell you this is exactly what I was hoping?
You remember you said that when she's 16 and starts dating.
Looking fabulous.
Let me see if they're done with the blood sugar, then we'll get you out.
I'll be right back.
Who is Jesse Pinkman?
Jesse...
Jesse Pinkman.
He called just this morning, Walt, please don't deny it.
It says on his MyShout page he attended Wynne.
Was he one of your students?
Yeah. He was...
nobody.
Who is he to you?
Why is he calling? What is this big secret
you seem to be discussing with some... druggie burn-out?
You don't come home
last night until 2 in the morning, you don't tell me where you've been.
You spent the entire night in the bathroom, Walt.
Tell me what's going on with you.
Don't you think you owe me that?
Who's this Jesse Pinkman to you?
He sells me pot.
He sells you... pot?
Marijuana, yeah.
Not a lot.
I mean, I don't know.
I kinda like it.
Are you out of your mind?
What are you, like 16 years old?
Your brother-in-law is a DEA agent.
What is wrong with you?
Skyler...
I just...
haven't quite been myself lately.
Yeah, no shit. Thanks for noticing.
I haven't been myself lately, but I love you.
Nothing about that has changed.
Nothing ever will.
So right now, what I need
is for you to climb down out of my ass.
Can you do that?
Will you do that for me, honey?
Will you, please, just once,
get off my ass?
You know, I'd appreciate it.
I really would.
Stop!
Stop in 15 minutes.
Just meat, is all. Just a bunch of meat.
Oh, Jesus.
It's cool, you're cool.
You're all good, yo.
You're all good in the hood.
It's fine. Just a bunch of meat, come on. You got it.
Excuse me!
Excuse me?
You.
Yes, you.
May I talk to you?
This is private property!
Just a minute. I wanna talk to you.
No, I'm not interested.
Hey, don't touch me! Do not touch me.
All right, look, not touching, okay? Not touching here.
Look, lady, whatever you're selling, I ain't buying, yo.
Well, my name is Skyler White, yo.
My husband is Walter White, yo.
He told me everything.
- Seriously? - That's right.
And just so you know...
My brother-in-law is a DEA agent.
And I will not hesitate to call him.
Not if I have to.
Understood?
This is your one and only warning.
Do not sell marijuana to my husband.
- Okay. - I mean it.
Don't call our house again.
You stay away from him, or you'll be one sorry individual.
You got me?
I think so, yeah.
No more marijuana.
I can dig it.
You can dig it.
Wonderful.
Not that it's any of my business,
but you might wanna consider a different line of work.
Okay.
"Let's go to your house, yo!
"Makes perfect sense. Let's...
"Let's completely screw up your house
"so you never wanna spend another night in it."
"Sure. You know, why not?"
"And then, how's about I send over my psycho-bitch wife to...
"you know, break your balls and threaten you?
"God, that'd be hilarious."
"And then, the killer in the basement?
"The one who's completely my responsabilty.
"Hell, let's just let him live down there.
"Just, I don't know, make sure to feed him, like...
"three times a day."
"Sure, why not?
"That would be amazing.
"Thank you so much for the opportunity.
"I always dreamt about, I don't know, melting bodies."
You got a brother in the goddamned DEA?
What?
You said you were just doing some ride-along.
Yes or no, do you have a brother in the DEA?
Brother-in-law.
Now there's a load off my mind.
Where did you hear that?
Your freaking wife told me when she was here all up on my shit.
Yeah, that's right.
She almost caught me moving Emilio!
Good job in wearing the pants in the family.
And why did you go and tell her I was selling you weed?
Because somehow, it seemed preferable to admitting
that I cook crystal meth and killed a man.
Is that what I think it is?
Yeah, it is. I smoked a bowl, so what?
My house, my rules.
Hey, no, no! Don't give me that, okay? I held up my end.
I already took care of Emilio.
You're still diddling around, trying to get your nut up.
Well, boo-hoo. I have the truly awful job here.
You wanna talk awful? You wanna go there?
Try dragging 200 pounds of stink up a flight of stairs.
I barely got him in the bathtub!
Bathtub? What...
- What do you mean, "bathtub"? - That's another thing,
Why you got me running around town,
trying to find some stupid piece of plastic,
when I have a perfectly good tub I can use?
Oh, God.
I'm sorry, what were you asking me?
Oh, yes.
That stupid plastic container I asked you to buy.
You see, hydrofluoric acid won't eat through plastic.
It will however dissolve metal, rock,
glass, ceramic.
So there's that.
Fuck, fuck, fuck! So late!
Mabel's put a scarf on the cat.
He's not a cat. He's my husband.
Where is he?
-Will he bring the ladies with the big boobies? -"Ladies"?
Last time, he brushed my hair with a fork.
There were three ladies, and they had an epic pillow fight.
-The fork had maple syrup on it. -Out of the way, darling.
Well,
it's obvious he's not coming, so I'll just stay home.
You said this was the one thing you had to leave the house for this year.
You're right. I'm going.
Move, please, Mabes.
Fuck-- caccia.
Did we eat the focaccia?
Well, we haven't got any vegetables.
But lucky you, you get to have frozen peas. Mmm.
All right. Come to the table.
Come on.
One, two...
What am I going to do when I get to three?
Please enter alarm code.
Oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck!
-Please enter alarm code. -No! Don't put the flames out.
-We can toast marshmallows. -Please enter alarm code.
Please--
The tension of our bodies,
the scars of--
Hello, Moto.
...in-- in our longing.
Bridget Jones, always exciting.
- How's the skirt? - Daniel, hi.
Just checking you have indeed forgotten about tonight.
That is hurtful, Jones. I have absolutely not forgotten.
No.
I'm so sorry. It's my mother.
- She's in the hospital. - Oh.
-Primordial sweat. -I will be there
quicker than it took me to bring you to earth-shattering orgasm,
you filthy little harlot.
Love you, Mummy.
"Mummy"?
Darling, clever Geminita.
I'm gonna have to rush. It's a family emergency.
But I am loving this one.
I think-- I think we all are, aren't we?
Call me later, yeah?
Oh, yeah.
I am imminent, Jones. Imminent.
Un-bunch those giant panties.
Bloody zip manufacturers should be
cancelled for sociological bias.
It is actually impossible to do this on your own.
Help.
Ooh. Thank you, monkeys.
Uncle Daniel!
Miniature Darcy, what's the news?
Where are the ladies with the big--
Hair? They couldn't make it, sadly.
They're, um... They're washing their hair.
All three?
Yeah, well, they wash each other's, you see.
I thought you said no more models.
Geminita is not a model, Jones.
She is a poet and a healer,
and a model.
Come here.
Hell of a night for you.
Ugh, I can't go. The children need me.
Uncle Daniel!
You. Right.
Get a fork and some syrup. I'm gonna style you.
- I found the cards. - Very good. Excellent.
Now then, we need to work on your bluffing and your cheating.
Life has its white notes...
and life has its black notes.
You look very beautiful tonight, Mrs Darcy.
Not looking so bad yourself, Mr Darcy.
Bridget.
Very black notes.
Jolly good. Come in. Weather's been a bit shitty, hasn't it?
-Though the cricket this year has been... -Jeremy.
...absolutely phenomenal.
This is what happened.
Mark Darcy, my husband,
father to Billy and Mabel,
died.
Or rather, was killed
in the Sudan on a humanitarian mission.
-Everybody's just upstairs. -Thanks.
And that was four years ago. Today, actually.
Brace yourself. It's a total fucking shit show.
And even though there might be 600,000 words in the human language,
the world still struggles to find the right ones
when someone you love is gone.
Bridget, how are the children?
- Mmm. - Are they--
Are they all right without you there?
No. It's fine.
Left them some crystal meth in the kitchen.
Maybe not.
Well, we don't make a thing about it.
We celebrate Mark's birthday instead.
So, Bridget, still on your own?
It's been four years now.
You're still in pretty good nick. Why no chap?
Now, now. It's not Bridget's fault. Very hard, being a middle-aged woman
- and finding yourself single. - Mmm.
Better if you're a bloke. Look at Binko Carruthers.
He's no oil painting,
but the second Rosemary died, he was inundated.
Of course, they were all of a certain age, though, weren't they?
Sorry, do you realise you said that out loud?
"A certain age"? What, do you mean our age?
- That is the most... - Shazzer now hosts
a podcast calledFed Up,
in which she has dinner with minor celebrities
while basically getting furious about everything.
...sexist fucking universe we, unbelievably,
still continue to fucking inhabit.
I need to go to the toilet.
Oh, dear.
Yeah, Jude. Yeah, I'm with her now.
Well, Shaz, tell her to come to The Golden Cock.
No, no, no. The party. It's for Mark.
That's not a party. That's a fucking bin fire.
And you think that Mark would want you to stay here and be insulted
in the fucking sexism Olympics?
To Mark.
- And to Bridget... - Aw.
...and the rare pleasure of seeing you
-in something not made of terry towelling.
Tom, still living
handsomely off his one hit single
which had a comeback recently in a 30-second video of a dog doing maths.
Now, of all things, a life coach.
Honestly, I'd say it was a bit of a breakthrough,
speaking as your psychologist.
You're not my psychologist.
Well, I should be, yes.
According to the classic model,
you've actually made it to the fourth stage
-of the five stages of grief. -Wait. Isn't it seven stages?
What are you talking about, Jude? No, it isn't. It's five stages.
-Isn't it five? -Well, I always thought it was four.
It's definitely seven.
Jude, now CEO or COO
or CTO, definitely a C-something-O,
still regularly calling, in tears, from executive bathroom.
So, um, only one stage to go now, Bridge.
- Oh. - Stage five.
It's acceptance, which basically means
-you just have to get laid. -Oh, my God. Shazzer's right.
Yes. I mean, honestly, darling, look at yourself.
You've become a born-again virgin.
If you don't get laid soon, your vagina will literally reseal itself.
Yeah, and that is a thing.
It's called labial adhesion.
Oh, my God!
I knew leaving the kitchen was a mistake.
I don't want anyone else.
And even if I did, which I don't,
I'm non-viable, completely asexual,
and nobody will ever fancy me again.
-Ever, ever, ever. -No. No, no, no.
And I'm going to the toilet.
Crash and burn. That was a disaster.
Well, that was a fucking disaster.
Crikey. Have we been burgled?
We have not been burgled, Jones. No.
We have been marvellous. Now, tell me this.
For Tonya, do we think a kitten heel or a chunky wedge?
She's going to Wimbledon.
Wedge, obviously.
You may be right.
How was it? Any fun? Any tongue?
Ugh. God. No tongue. I have hung up my tongue.
How were they?
Well, the girl is you.
Lawless, romantic, irresistibly drawn to me.
Asked me if I was going to be her new daddy.
She does that.
Yeah. Wouldn't go to bed until I'd married her rabbit.
- Hmm. - -Which I was very happy to do.
That rabbit is not at all unfanciable.
Hmm. And Billy?
Well, Billy is Darcy, isn't he?
Still waters and all that.
As it happens, Jones, your son
and I have a number of shared interests.
Oh, God. Like what?
Models.
He showed me his, I showed him mine.
-Hmm. -And then we-- we talked about death.
Did you?
Yeah. I told him being dead was shit.
And that I should know because I was for a bit.
I gave him a hug 'cause he seemed a bit sad.
And then that made me sad because...
How is your boy?
Enzo's, what? He's...
Uh, fuck knows, Jones. Fifteen, I think.
Anyway, we then cheered ourselves up by digging out the cocktail shaker,
and I taught him how to make a Dirty Bitch.
Saved it for you. It's in the fridge.
Goody. Have it for breakfast.
Yeah, hello, hello, hello, hello.
Geminita.
Yeah, we're all done. All done. I'm on my way.
Well, as quick as I can.
Yes, like naughty old moth to eager young flame.
No, you hang up first.
And-- OK, kiss you back.
Yeah, OK. Louder. Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Fuck off, Jones. OK, they're asleep.
Um... ...it did take a bit of time.
But I-- Actually I showed them a video of Geminita
reciting one of her prose poems and they were out like a light.
All right.
What happens now?
I'm trying to remember how it worked with our babysitters.
I think you give me 20 quid and try and shag me, don't you?
Ah, Daniel, dear Daniel.
At least some things never change.
It makes me sad though, Jones. You know...
two children and you all alone and effectively a nun.
Albeit, of course, a very, very naughty nun.
Bye, Daniel.
Yeah.
Thanks for tonight.
Yeah.
Why are these lights still on?
I thought you two were asleep.
Do you miss Dada sometimes?
I miss him all of the times.
There's my owl.
Back to bed. Come on.
- Story, Mama? - Mm-hmm.
For the baby princess is as kind as she is fair.
And the baby prince is as gentle as he is handsome.
And wherever they go and whatever they do,
Mummy and Daddy will always love them.
And Saliva.
She stinks, Mabes.
-Good night, darling. -Good night, Mama.
Good night.
And all the thoughts...
And all the thoughts are going away.
They don't need little Billy and Mabel tonight.
The world will turn without them.
The stars will shine without them.
And all little Billy and Mabel need to do is rest and sleep.
Good night.
Night.
Good night, Billy.
- Do the song, Daddy. Please. - OK.
♪ I'll do anything For you, dear♪

All by myself 47.
Shitballs.
No. Cock-bollocking fuck-bubbles!
Literally everyone else in the whole country
is laughing uproariously with their partners
while watching Netflix and having sex.
You don't want to wallow in it, darling.
And there they are again.
All the voices, all the advice.
You gotta wallow in it, Bridge. Wallow.
Grieve. G-R-E-I-V-E.
It's I-E. It's not E-I.
No, it's, "I before E except after C."
Yes, exactly.
God, you really are such a T-W-T-A.
A what?
The thing about advice is,
no one tells you the same thing twice.
Bridget, you've got to put the children first.
Uh-huh. Thank you, Magda. Yes.
Put the children first.
Sod the children.
Put your own oxygen mask on first.
Right. Oxygen mask.
Got it.
One thing's for certain, Bridge.
Forget about sex. Oh.
OK.
No sex.
You need to have a lot of sex.
Yeah. Why don't you come back to work?
Thank you, Richard. I'll bear that in mind.
But as my dad said just before he died,
the big question is...
Can you survive?
I think so.
I have to.
I'm trying.
It's not enough to survive. You've got to live.
Is that the Dalai Lama?
It's Harry Styles, I think.
Colin.
-Is that a sausage? -What sausage?
Bridget, you know what the doctor said about saturated fats.
Pam, could you take a photograph of us? Me and Bridget.
Colin, try not to do that with your chin.
I'm not doing anything with my chin.
Promise me you'll live, Bridget.
Smile!
Bridget Jones, it's time to live.

Right. You've got your pencil case,
your lunch, your homework?
- Your keys? - Ooh.
you've definitely got your recorder so that's good.
Your lovely picture of a spaceship.
It's a cat.
Oh, yes. Of course it is, darling.
What paints did you use?
I used the lipsticks with the C's on them.
-Oh. So creative. -Handbag?
Oh, fuck a duck.
Hello, Billy.
Morning.
Hello, Mabel.
Morning, Bridget.
Hi.
Just the usual crap.
Are you going to be my new daddy?
- No, Mum! - No! Mum!
When I signed up for having children,
I did not sign up to be ruled by
a gaggle of computer crackheads.
Well, guess what?
I've had you, I've brought you up,
and I've changed my mind!
No! No, no, no!
Don't you touch those or I'll fucking enter you in Squid Game.
Here, darling.
-Come, come. -Mum!
Why don't we ever say hello?
Oh. Important life lesson, darling.
Never meet your heroes.
Starting today, will not set things on fire,
will responsibly reset passwords not to include the word "fuckwit,"
and will not be frightened of the school mums...
Hi.
...in particular, Perfect Nicolette...
...with her perfect twins.
Move the car! There's no parking in front of the school.
-How are you? -What?
I-I thought you were in LA.
-Right. -Mr Walliker?
Mr Walliker, Eros tells me he hasn't been selected for the choir for some reason.
-Correct. -Well, how can that be?
Because he can't sing. Anything else, Mrs Soltani-Watkins?
Mr Walliker, if you have failed to recognise Eros's obvious talents,
-that's hardly his fault. -It's really quite simple.
The choir, like everything else in nature, is chosen on merit.
Yeah, natural selection.
If Eros wants to put in the work, he's welcome to audition again.
If you'll excuse me. Bike!
Bike! Not there. Not there.
Who's that?
Oh. New science teacher. Mr Walliker.
Instant hero.
Unbelievably rude.
He's awful.
Move along, please. Right away!
You two! This isn't a stroll on the heath.
You don't see me unfolding deck chairs and unwrapping sandwiches, do you?
Move it inside! It's choir in eight minutes.
Mr Walliker. Hello.
I don't believe we've met.
I'm Billy Darcy's mum.
The boy about to be diagnosed with tinnitus.
The whistle is an essential tool, Mrs Darcy.
Mmm. An essential tool?
Eros! Atticus!
If you're late, you will regret it for the rest of your days.
Sorry, sir!
No!
She'll be back later.
We have a doctor's appointment.
I've got worms!
Why is your granny wearing pyjamas?
That went well.
"G-O-N-O"--
That's lovely, darling.
-"R-H"... -There you go.
One tablet a day for the entire family,
and if her itching doesn't stop, I suggest you get rid of that cat.
Have you got some help yet?
I know it doesn't look it, but really,
-I've got it all in hand. -No, it doesn't look it.
Apart from anything else, I'm a gynaecologist, not a paediatrician.
And whilst I'm happy to step in, you do take my point.
If you say "oxygen mask" to me again, I will hit you with this handbag.
I am not afraid of handbags.
You need something else to do.
You need a reason to get out of those pyjamas.
Well, fashion's never really been your thing.
-Rude. -Pyjamas are all the rage in Milan.
Bridget, in spite of all objective evidence to the contrary,
you are a bright, talented, brilliant woman.
And my professional advice to you is this.
-You need-- -No. No, no, no.
Please don't tell me to go and have sex.
Oh, good Lord, no.
No.
Read a book. Clean out the kitchen drawers.
Leave the pink bits well enough alone.
You'll be ready when you're ready.
No, my professional advice to you is this:
go back to work.
And how's your love life?
On fire.
"Sy-P-Lis."
- Mmm. - Syphilis. Mabel, Syphilis.
Syphilis.
Mmm. Very good. Very good.
And there's some delicious vegetarian alternatives here too.
Floods, fires and famine.
As the world teeters on the edge of climate catastrophe,
sausages aren't the only thing we are grilling today.
Environment Secretary Sarah Givens joins us after the break.
Hi.
Oh, thank God you picked up.
What's the matter?
They've got the bloody Environment Secretary on in 45 seconds
and they've got me asking her questions about bloody tea bags.
"What's the best way to recycle tea bags?"
"Can you clean surfaces with tea"...
I need you, Bridget!
OK. Uh...
Ask her...
Ask her why there were no tax breaks for renewable energy
-in last week's budget. -Brilliant.
She'll fob you off with some crap about economic constraints
and then you nail her on oil and gas companies ring-fencing their profits.
- Yes, I do. - She'll flap!
And then you nuke her arse on the government's support for fracking.
I fracking love you, Bridget Jones.
-Hi, Bridge. -Yes!
Oh, oh, oh! Do try to find out about the tea bags though.
- Love you. Bye. Bye. - Love you. Bye!
Welcome back.
Our next guest is
Environment Secretary Sarah Givens.
Sarah, budget, tax breaks, fracking.
Justify.
And no fob-off!
Could you please put me through to Richard Finch's office?
My name's Bridget Jones.
Yeah. I'll hold. Thanks.
Billy, I want to watch SpongeBob.
Billy, come off that, please.
You've had your screen time.
One, two...
But, Mummy, it's Sunday.
No.
Can I watch SpongeBob?
May I watch SpongeBob.
Yes?
No, you've got to say, "may I," not "can I."
May I watch SpongeBob?
-No. -But, Mummy!
No, no, no, no.
No more screens, either of you.
Screens have been proven to shorten attention spans and...
No.
Will you come and practise cricket with me in the garden?
Mummy really needs to work, darling. Why don't you play with Mabel?
She refuses to hit the ball. She says she feels sorry for Ball-y.
Ball-y.
Darling, please go and play cricket with Billy.
I may not!
Is it too much to ask to get some bloody peace all by my bloody self
for five bloody minutes?
Internet's down!
I want to watch SpongeBob.
Tell Billy it's my turn.
- Mummy! - I don't want to be a mummy right now.
You had it for ages!
I didn't even have it today. It's my turn!
Mummy!
There's no Internet!
I just want to sit down
in echoing silence on my own for one moment.
- Mummy! Mummy! - Just shut up!
Shark bait!
Come and get it!
Okay. You asked for it!
Miranda?
All right, Bridge?
What're you doing here?
So I was reading the newspaper in Soho House
and it was so, so quiet, you know?
I just miss all this.
Off milk, stuff, clutter, children, life.
Plenty of that here.
You don't have any champagne.
Top tip:
always keep a cold bottle of champagne
in the fridge for emergencies.
That's excellent advice.
Cards on the table,
I'm thinking of unfreezing my eggs.
Apparently, everyone is going to Denmark
to get sperm.
-Oh. -Yeah.
But I want what you have. All of this.
But Soho House and-and Sunday papers and cold champagne--
You're free, Bridge.
You're liberated from the tyranny of this.
Do you know how many dating apps I use?
Could you look sexy?
Well, I mean...
I might still brush up OK given enough time.
No, I mean for this photo.
I've set you up on Tinder.
-What? -You're welcome.
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no. -Well, I've popped you down as a widow.
It's so much more romantic and singular.
We all agree it's what you need.
What's Tinder?
such a lovely day.
Who wants to, um, go to the heath?
-No, I don't wanna go! -No, SpongeBob!
Oh, OK. That's no problem.
Uh, sure.
Um, you stay here,
and I'll just, uh, take these chocolate buttons. Ooh!
-Let's go, nutters! -Can't wait!
Children and fresh air and white chocolate buttons.
I feel like Julie Andrews!
Oh! I just got matched with someone.
Sorry, Mabel, could you just get off, actually,
'cause you're killing my back.
Uh, he's on a street corner... in a van.
-He looks like Jason Statham... -Mmm.
...if you squint.
In a bit, Bridge.
Bye, kids. See you.
- Bye! - Bye.
Oh, how everything calms down once you're outside in blue skies
turning the children into biddable lemurs.
Will obviously delete Tinder immediately.
But perhaps a very quick look first.
Keith?
Who are you, Keith?
Feel suddenly exposed to whole new world hiding in plain sight
like Narnia through back of wardrobe,
but with lion and witch shagging.
Mummy! Mabel's stuck up the tree!
- How'd she get up there? - Mummy!
Coming!
Okay.
No, it's... it's all right.
- I can't get down either. - It's all right. I'm here.
Billy. Is that you?
Oh, no. It's Mr Walliker.
Everything all right, Mrs Darcy?
Yep. Super.
Just climbing a tree.
I can see that.
Having fun?
Yes. Yeah, this is really fun.
-You sure you don't need a hand? -No, no.
As Einstein said,
"What goes up must come down."
-Newton. -Yes.
Newton.
We're going to die!
No, we're not going to die. We're having fun.
We are definitely going to die.
Clearly you've got this nicely in hand.
Look, there's a policeman.
Oh, my God.
I've climbed a magical man tree.
- Are you stuck? - Yes!
No.
-Do they need help? -Apparently not.
So, I'll... I'll be off then.
Bye-bye.
Okay. I'll be off too.
Don't go away.
No, seriously. Don't go away.
Hang on. I'm coming.
Okay. Coming up.
Hello.
Okay, just... Hang on.
Hello.
Hi, mate.
-Hi, what's your name? -Mabel.
-Mabel. -I can't jump down.
Okay. Well, you sit down there.
You get comfy, and I'm gonna go down there and catch you, OK?
-Okay, you ready? -Yeah.
Three, two, one, go!
- I did it! -I've got you. Well done.
All right, big man. Your turn.
Okay. You got this, mate. There we go.
- Next foot. - That's it, darling.
And I've got you.
Okay, Mum.
Okay.
There we go.
-Okay. -Okay.
- You all right? - Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's all right.
Uh, I'm Roxby. But you can call me Roxster.
Bridget Jones.
But you can call her Mummy.
Hmm. Okay.
I think this is yours.
Thanks.
Anything else I can help with?
God, yes.
No.
Okay.
It's nice to meet you, Roxy.
It's Roxster.
You too, Bridget Jones.
Now obsessed with tree-rescuing Adonis
and reentering world of flirting simultaneously with workforce.
-Mrs Darcy. -Mr Walliker.
Weapon at the ready, I see.
Good to see you managed to extricate yourself from that tree.
Oh, yes. It's the children's favourite game.
We're completely obsessed with the outdoors in our house.
Well, I'll have to put you down for our Outward Bound trip next term.
Sounds like it'd be right up your street.
Fucking fuck.
Yeah. Good.
Do you have my slime? I promised I'd show Cosmata.
Hey, those are mine.
Give them to me.
They are actually hers.
Well, in that case...
Bridget!
You're dressed properly.
Odd.
Heading to a meeting.
Thinking about going back to my old job.
Oh, a job. Oh, I'll put you down for Jobs Day then.
Fucking fuckety fuck fuck.
Yes, absolutely.
Celestine, merci. C'est gentil.
Actually, do you mind tidying this up a little bit?
Sure.
Uh, what about the children? Do you have a nanny?
Not yet.
Oh, I've got the perfect person. She's excellent.
She's very pretty, but that doesn't matter, Bridget,
because you don't have a husband,
so it's absolutely immaterial how pretty and perfect she is.
-Sounds good. -There we go.
-Francesca. -Sorry.
Wonderful.
It's nothing. I just threw it together.
Bridget? Your donation?
You didn't forget?
No.
Certainly not.
Uh, let's see.
Here we are.
Hummus.
And, uh...
Rice cakes.
And look, they've even been opened already.
Lovely.
Ah. Her name's Chloe, and she'll be with you at 6:30.
Raef! India! Get inside.
Bridget Jones.
Thank you.
Four.
Four.
- Three. - Three.
Thank you.
This is Bridget Jones about to
go into an actual in-person meeting.
-Brenda Jones? -Oh, actually, it's--
Bridget Jones, there you are. Excellent. Quick, come with me.
-Thank you, Lizzie. -Thanks.
Good to see ya. How have you been?
You look hot.
Oh. Thank you, Richard.
But I think you'll find that sort of language is a little outmoded
-in the workplace. -No, I mean flustered.
Are you going through the, uh, you know?
Bridget, let me introduce you to Talitha.
Richard, what am I supposed to do with this, huh?
Does it climb? Does it stand on one leg?
Does it do cartwheels? It's a tortoise. It doesn't do anything.
He can't pull out. Who the fuck does he think he is?
Arrogant, self-important prick.
Tell that selfish arsehole he can rot in hell.
The Dalai Lama's cancelled.
Twat. Shit.
Okay, we've got an hour till we're on air.
We need a replacement. Let me make a call.
I do Krav Maga with Fergie.
Duchess or Black Eyed Pea?
Duchess. She could be here in 45.
Talitha, meet Bridget Jones. Best producer we've ever had.
I'm sure you're very good too.
Huge fan.
Hold this.
Loved your early work from Chechnya.
Now I'm doing features on incontinent tortoises.
Fergie.
Are those glutes burning up?
Hello.
-Hey. Sorry. -Right.
Uh, right. Let's get rid of this set, please, now!
So, what do you think?
Can we lure you back?
Fergie's in.
Does anyone know how to get tortoise piss out of silk?
Blotting and mild detergent.
When can I start?
Am rejoining ranks of London's employed
and meaningfully contributing to society.
Can walk with head held high and be role model for Billy and Mabel,
saving them from otherwise certain future as alcoholic wards of the state.
It's super that the television's invited you back.
Of course, I always stayed at home when you were little.
Classic Mum.
Can't really talk, Mum.
I've got to tidy up before the nanny gets here.
A nanny? Really?
Mummy doesn't love us anymore. Ow!
Ever since Mum and Una moved into Audsley House,
the retirement home we have to pretend is a hotel,
the phone calls have been the same.
Any men on the horizon, Bridget?
Well, there's got to be someone. Some people don't mind a widow.
Stings a bit.
Beggars can't be choosers, Bridget.
And now, look, we're in the hotel kitchen
doing salmon in the sous vide.
I mean, it's basically boil-in-the-bag,
but everybody's doing it these days.
Roxster. Definite development.
Cooking's never really been your thing.
Oh, must go. Bye, Mum!
Bye, bye.
Oh, God, it's her.
Hi, I'm Chloe.
Hello.
What the actual fuck?
She looks like a film star.
Chloe, this is Mabel.
Look, I can play the recorder with my nose.
Children, this is Chloe.
She's going to come and help with everything.
Nicolette mentioned it would be a challenge,
-but I've certainly seen worse. -Oh.
Oh, and this is Billy, the science genius.
Ooh, we mustn't pigeonhole children. It adds undue pressure.
Have you read How To Raise a Self-Driven Child?
Oh, yes. It's-It's on my list,
Oh, not to worry, Billy.
It's not about the result. It's about the journey.
There's something to learn whether you get an A or a C.
Billy has never had a C in...
Who did this?
Mr Walliker.
I drew the earth and the atmosphere, and I put heaven over the top.
And Mr Walliker said that heaven was a religious construct.
And he gave me a C.
Well, Mr Walliker
is a whistle-obsessed fascist
with all the soul of a non-stick wok.
Where did you hide the chocolate digestives?
I didn't hide...
...anything.
Well, plenty to do here.
Consumed with guilt re hideously perfect nanny,
who children will obviously come to love more than hopeless mother
without film star hair.
And texting Roxster slowly became part of my life.
A relationship with no necessity for actually meeting,
or arrangements, or sex, or any real life at all.
In other words, the perfect relationship.
Is that the tree Adonis?
Wait a minute.
You wrote to him, "How are you liking Tinder?"
Inoffensive, neutral, a bit dull.
He replied, "Don't know, only joined it to find you, Bridget Jones."
-Shag him now. -Mm-mmm.
Then he sent a smiley emoji
and then you responded with the flag of Greece,
an abacus and a duck.
I panicked.
Thank you.
Who's next?
Do you want to go for a drink?
I'm so flattered.
Um, but I've got a boyfriend.
Well, sort of got a boyfriend. I think.
Um, so nice of you to ask, but, um...
no, thank you.
No, it's part of the meal deal.
Well, this one's easy.
You absolutely must go. Obviously.
But we've been texting for so long now. I can't meet him.
I mean, maybe it's like in Jane Austen's day
when they did letter writing for months and months
and then suddenly just got married.
Bridget, sexting a man that you just met in a park
is nothing like Jane Austen's day.
-If you don't shag him, I will. -I can't.
There is no possibility of being naked with a man at this point in my life.
You just need a little rebrand.
You'll start by getting a slip.
-A slip? -Yeah, with a slip,
you can show off your arms, your legs, your décolletage,
which are always the last to go.
And keep the central area,
which one might want to gloss over, glossed over.
And get a Brazilian.
God, no.
I like a bit of coverage down there.
Or run a comb through it at least.
But also, do get a Brazilian.
Just dust it. Dust it down.
Okay, I'll go!
But I'm not going to sleep with him.
Are condoms meant to be coloured?
Is hypersensitive good?
Large? Small? Oh.
Maybe just purchase a representative selection.
Regular.
Mmm, exotic flavours.
Thin feel.
Extra-large.
Pleasure Me.
Lube.
Pleasure Me again.
Enjoy your weekend, Mrs Darcy.
Hello, old friend.
Thanks for having the kids tonight.
Always a pleasure, never a chore.
I'll take them to school in the morning.
So you can stay out as late as you want.
Make up for four years of no shagging.
It's only a drink.
Too see-through?
Mmm. Definitely.
OK.
How about this?
OK.
The reality suddenly completely terrifying,
and Mark, and insane and flabby.
And oh, God, oh, God.
I can't.
-I really can't. -Oh. What? What?
-No, I just can't. -Aw. Hey, you can.
You just need to think of it as widening your circle of friends.
That's all.
Come on.
Put on the dress, get out of here
and widen your fucking circle.
Oh, God. Look at him.
What if he's perfect?
Hello.
Hi.
There's a really great place around here that's been here for forever.
Do you know this area at all?
Mmm, I used to.
Yeah, the, uh, Heath Ranger thing is just a day job.
And my real passion is garbage.
Really?
The technical term is garbologist.
I'm a biochemist. Studying to be one.
You're a student.
A late-in-life one, anyway. Yeah.
How late?
I'm 28.
I'm just kidding.
I'm 29.
Fuck.
Is he closer in age to me or to Billy?
What about you?
You are...
Slightly older.
I'm gonna say 35-ish.
Yes.
Bull's-eye.
Let's say 35.
-Mmm. Thirty-five it is. -Mm-hmm.
Is 35 all right?
I think older women,
ever so slightly older women,
have a wiser view on life.
You know, they're more experienced
and more emotionally mature.
Me in a nutshell.
I find that very attractive.
Oh, God. I have no idea how any of this works anymore.
Is it all right if I kiss you?
Aw. The generation who ask.
I think that would be acceptable.
Give me just one moment.
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?
I...
You all right?
Yeah. It's just...
Yeah. Okay.
Wow. It's really tight.
♪ I am an animal...♪ Oh, God.
-Mabel's. -Ah.
You make me so hard, baby.
You make me hard.
What?
How did that happen? I'm using protection.
-Hi, Bridge. -Morning.
I've got coffee and I've got Ricky Gervais's
requests for today's show.
- Seriously? - Yeah.
-It's big. -Yeah.
-A relaxation corner. -Uh-huh.
Three full-length mirrors.
And he'll only use La Mer for some reason?
I know.
- Ooh. Three, please. - Three.
Did you have sex last night?
What? No.
Sam! Ricky Gervais is on his way in.
And, apparently, he won't drink Evian, only Icelandic water.
And it's got to have lots of alkalines.
Or no alkalines.
Did you have sex last night?
What? No!
God!
Tape measure, please. Quick.
The cushion can't be more than 40 centimetres from the floor for Ricky.
Did you have sex last night?
Yes. I did. Okay? I did.
I had a full night of utterly mind-blowing sex
with a tree-rescuing rubbish expert Adonis who might be slightly younger, probably.
And it was amazing!
Okay?
So what?
Am not only mother and sexual being,
but also capable working woman at the top of her game.
So take that, Chloe.
I've done the macaroni and cheese, but with butternut squash instead.
It's in the bottom oven. Just needs to move to the top in about 20 minutes.
Good. Good. Right.
It's just how I would do it.
uh, it would be really helpful
to have their water bottles done the night before.
In the fridge. Top right.
Where the expired milk was.
Oh, great. Great. Um...
Billy will need something extra for snack tomorrow.
-He's got-- -Cricket, yeah.
In a snack bag. Labelled. By the bread bin.
-We have a bread bin? -I have to leave, I'm afraid.
Graham and I have tai chi on Thursdays.
6:45 sharp, but earlier to get the spot you want.
Oh. 'Course.
You and Graham enjoy your tai chi.
Oh, you forgot to leave out Billy's cricket things,
but never mind. I'll do it.
Bag packed by the door.
Nevertheless,
secret to calmer, happier parenting:
one-night stands.
Although, it wasn't just one night.
Brought a pie.
That was funny.
And so, a moment turned into a date,
which turned into a kiss.
Which turned into a night.
And the night turned into a summer.
Morning. Welcome back.
-Good morning, Mr Walliker. -Morning.
-Morning. -Mrs Darcy.
How were your summer holidays?
I have a new daddy now.
His name is Roxster,
and he always gives Mummy
a funny hairstyle in the morning.
Yes, well. It's not that funny, is it, Mabel?
It is.
He's not a new daddy. He's just someone.
Off you go.
Well, it seems congratulations are in order.
You!
-No. You two. Come on. -Bye, Mum. See you soon. Bye.
Bridget, I emailed you from Anguilla about, um--
Jobs Day, yes. I come prepared.
I must say, it's a welcome change, all... this.
Thank you.
All right, everyone. Settle down.
Settle down. Thank you.
Um, so...
Last term, Daveed's dad was kind enough to talk to us
about being a thoracic surgeon,
and next week, Eugenie's mum will be in
to talk about her role as a nuclear physicist,
and how it felt to win the Nobel Prize.
But today, it's Billy's mum.
So, everyone, give a warm welcome to Mrs Darcy.
Hello.
I am a television producer.
My mum says television is making society rot.
Yes. Well, thank you, Priscilla.
OK. May we have a volunteer?
Thank you, Esmeralda.
Right.
You can stand here.
Very good.
And you are going to say things like,
"Ten seconds to air!"
And I am going to be the interviewer for the day.
Now...
Just...
Right. OK.
Perhaps Mr Walliker could be the person being interviewed.
Take a seat.
Uh, righto.
Now, topic.
The life cycle of the fruit fly. Hmm?
Right, OK.
Ooh. Ten seconds to air!
Hello, this is Bridget Jones,
and I'm delighted to have Mr Walliker on the show today
to help us understand the life cycle of the fruit fly.
it's a pleasure to be on the show.
And, um, thank you for that question.
Well, the, uh, the average...
Thank you.
Uh, the average fly takes about
two weeks to mature
and can live for as long as 40 or 50 days.
And then, like all living things, when it dies, it simply stops.
Cellular shutdown.
It falls, gradually decomposes,
and becomes part of the soil system.
But does it really end when it dies?
Exactly, Mr Walliker.
Surely there's more to the story.
Um, well. Well, not really.
But, yes.
After the body of the fruit fly stops working,
uh, then the soul of the fruit fly
will be able to be free, yes?
And that particular fruit fly
will always, in some senses, be with us.
-The soul of the fruit fly? -Hmm.
There's no evidence for a soul,
but the body is a perfect system of electrical pulses,
powered by the heart, which is in itself
-a pump, if you will-- -The soul, Mr Walliker,
is the essence of every living thing.
If you think we're simply bits of machinery
that can be switched on or off,
then where does art come from?
Or-Or wonder? Or poetry?
-Or magic? -Magic?
The fruit fly, when it dies,
will stay with its fruit fly family forever.
Keep the interview on point, Bridget.
This is utter nonsense.
Our world is governed by laws and fact.
That's our universe.
-And it is rational. -Cut!
I'm a realist, Mrs Darcy.
I believe in what's real.
Cut!
Off to Talitha's birthday.
Are you sure you're OK to stay tonight?
It's Thursday. I thought you and Graham had tai chi.
Won't kill him to miss a week, will it?
He's so uptight.
Oh, you look nice, Bridget.
Oh, try this.
There.
Thanks, Chloe.
Billy! Mabes! Snacks on the table.
So where is he? Is he not coming?
Oh, it's fine. He must have been held up.
-What? By some sort of rubbish emergency? -Oh.
- Probably had to finish his homework. - -Stop it.
Hope he gets here before story time.
Shut it!
Come the fuck on, Bridge.
Does this guy actually exist
or is it, um, like that one time
that you saw Brad Pitt at Costa Coffee?
-It was him. It was. -Come on. Really?
- Happy birthday. - Lovely to see you.
What on earth are you holding?
Oh, Petula.
A present to myself
and I already prefer her to any human.
♪ Happy birthday to you♪
Oh, here. Can you hold my baby
while I feign surprise at the cake
that I chose and bought for myself.
Oh, look! Look at that!
♪ Happy birthday, dear Talitha♪
Thank you. Oh, look.
♪ Happy birthday to you♪
Thank you.
Thank you all so much for coming today
to help me celebrate, well, me.
We love you, Talitha.
- Talitha! - Talitha! Happy birthday.
Beep, beep. Beep, beep.
Binko Carruthers.
Oh, please don't come over. Please don't.
Beep, beep.
There she is. The famous Bridget Jones.
So I told Cosmo I'd take you out for a spin.
How's Friday?
Fuck, no!
Jude, get in there. Come on, get the fuck in there! God, help!
Oh, my God. Oh!
- Petula, come on, darling. - Petula! Petula!
Who's that?
-I think this belongs to you. -Thank you.
-Hello. -Hi.
Sorry I'm late. Buses were a nightmare.
It's fine.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
She just jumped out of my arms.
Do not apologise.
Oh, my darling.
Let me help you out of those wet clothes.
No. Don't you dare redress him.
-You look gorgeous. -You look gorgeous.
Now that, my darling, is what I call a rebrand.
Hi. I'm Roxster.
I hope he's up to it, darling.
-Hello. -Oh, fuck off.
If there is a God,
I'm sure he had more to deal with that night
than my personal happiness,
but it did feel like he'd taken the night off everything else
to focus on me.
But then...
I wish I had a time machine.
A time machine.
In his moment of inebriated joy,
he had given himself away.
It mattered to him.
And with that came the elephant stomping heavily into the room.
That happens to us all, James.
Oh, I do have about 60 naps a day.
Well, 60 in the morning and a nap in the afternoon.
Yeah, but you've got so many interesting characters in this show.
So this show is for...
Ghosting.
The practice of ending a relationship
by suddenly and without explanation
withdrawing from all communication.
The slow unveiling of reality and rejection.
The casual cruelty.
Do not text when ghosted.
Do not text when drunk.
Ghost the bastard back, Bridget.
Just let him disintegrate into nothingness.
It can be a jungle out there.
Yep. And I'm the giant panda,
sexually obsolete and destined to be alone forever.
No. You will adapt and survive like we all do.
I used to be on the cover of Vanity Fairin a flak jacket.
And now I'm on the cover of Good Housekeepingwith a pavlova.
Cathy...
where's your special stuff?
HD TV was an extinction-level event
for the fearless career television presenter.
I'm about to usher you into your next chapter.
Lip serum. I get it on the dark web.
-Is it legal? -Absolutely.
In Venezuela.
Here, take it.
Adapt and survive.
Adapt and survive.
Ooh. Something's definitely happening.
It's either disastrous or totally fantastic.
Mummy!
Hi, sweetie.
Shit. What's happening to my voice?
Mabel's shoes are on the wrong feet.
No. My feet are on the wrong legs.
Silly thing.
Mummy, something's wrong with your mouth.
No.
No, there isn't.
Yes, there is. Look.
Your lips are all funny right there.
Darling, don't be ridiculous.
All right, Mabel, let's get these swapped over, shall we?
Out we pop. All right.
I wouldn't do that again if I were you, Mrs Darcy.
You looked all right to begin with.
All right.
You're trying to look younger
and the effects have marked similarities to those of an elderly stroke victim.
You're actually drooling now.
Oh, dear.
Now, acutely aware as I am of my waiting room
filled to capacity with actual patients--
not to mention the fact that I am a gynaecologist
and that particular set of lips is,
as it were, broadly speaking, at the wrong end--
I am nonetheless going to ask you the question,
"Bridget, are you OK?"
A simple yes will suffice.
No.
It's all your fault.
"Twat." Sorry, it's doctor's handwriting.
That's an A, in the middle there.
Now, I rather zoned out after "pyjamas",
but a toy boy is not the answer, Bridget, and nor are big lips.
You're a widow
with two wonderful children who adore you.
You're just trying to cope with a shitty situation.
Embrace the chaos.
That's just a simple allergic reaction to
hydroxymethoxyphenyl propylmethylmethoxybenzofuran
in whatever infernal concoction you've smeared on your mouth.
This is an antihistamine.
It'll work straight away.
It's for the lips.
They still haven't invented anything for being a twat.
Hello.
Yes, this is Bridget.
Of course! Straight away.
Yes, yes.
Daniel.
Well, by all that's holy,
Bridget Jones.
Nice of you to come, Jones.
If I'd known, I'd have worn a tinier nightie.
What happened?
My heart.
Two massive surprises.
One, I have one. Two, it murmurs.
They've, um, had a listen and I don't know.
Are you OK?
Well, I thought I was having a heart attack.
My whole life passed before my eyes.
You actually featured prominently, Jones.
-Hmm. -All the best bits.
Rome. Mini-break weekend.
Sodomy in Sainsbury's.
But, uh, mainly,
it was just me wandering up and down the King's Road
trying to twinkle at 20-year-olds.
Perhaps it's an opportunity for a new beginning.
Brand-new Daniel.
I think I shall stay right here...
until you agree.
Well that is kind of you, Bridge, but, um...
they told me I don't have long.
-What? -No, no, no. Fuck. No, not that.
Well, maybe that. No, they, uh...
they're taking me for some tests in a minute.
The question is, would we say I've become a fraction tragic?
They asked me to put down my next of kin.
And the only person I could think of who might remotely care was you.
- That's very sweet. - -Yeah, but not deliberately.
The point is, Bridge, how have I arrived
at this point in my life with no kin?
How could I possibly be kinless?
But you're not. You're not kinless.
Well, I haven't seen Enzo since he was two.
And he is now being happily raised by his mother
and an Italian aristocrat who wears his jumper like a shawl.
So, lucky you, Jones.
Your two, the way they look at you...
just makes one realise...
one's own fuck-ups, really.
The glory of what might have been.
Did you know...
it was actually quite good
with Gisele at the beginning?
I have to face the fact...
...that it may have been, Jones, love.
The real thing.
I still don't know what she was so pissed off about.
You shagged her sister.
Once. Massive overreaction.
God, I love you, Daniel.
Despite your really quite impressive
lifelong dedication to total fuckwittage.
Yeah.
There's a lot I don't know.
An awful lot.
But I do know that my children would give anything at all
to have just one day with their dad.
Time for your obs, Mr Cleaver.
Oh, right.
And, again, there is really no need
for you to remove your gown.
Sorry.
Okey-doke.
God.
Then lights down on the cooking segment.
Why do I always have to do the cooking bits?
That chestnut ravioli he cooked last time
was the worst thing I've ever put in my mouth.
I highly doubt that.
And then, Miranda, you cross to the stage.
"And now, on Better Women, a surprise guest." Blah blah.
And lights!
Hold it!
Linus, we've got to practise following her with the lights.
So, uh...
maybe you could dance a bit? Yeah?
- Uh... - OK. Go, Linus!
Can you hold that, please? See, you've got to, you know, go for it.
'Cause she's going to, you know...
- See, Linus? - Hi, B.
Oh, shit.
Brought a pie.
Sorry, they just told me to come in.
You disappeared, Roxster.
I know.
I know.
I panicked.
I got-- I got scared, and I ran.
But I want this.
You.
I thought I wasn't ready, but I am.
I thought I...
I don't know, wanted somebody my own age,
but I don't.
I love you, Bridget.
I'm ready for all of it.
For Billy and Mabel.
And burnt lasagne.
And slime.
And all of it.
I promise you, I am ready.
I'm not sure that matters.
What do you mean? I don't-- I don't understand.
You're so lovely,
and you're going to be
a brilliant partner and dad.
And you're going to discover
all sorts of garbage that will change the world.
That's not how it works.
But not with me.
I wish I had a time machine too.
So you could catch up.
Are you-- Are you sure?
I am.
I'll keep the pie, if that's OK.
Goodbye, Bridget.
Parents' evening.
Is there a worse night for the single parent?
They call it parents' evening
as if it's a plural.
As if it's a given that there's two of us.
Oh, well. Chin up and onward.
Mrs Darcy.
It's good to see you.
Good to be back in the studio.
The great fruit fly debate.
Small secret.
It was about 50 times more interesting
than that bloody thoracic surgeon.
And don't get me started on the physicist.
I mean, they'll hand out Nobels to anyone these days.
Oh, yeah.
So, uh, Billy.
Well, he's, um... he's an excellent cricketer.
-Mm-hmm. -You know,
he's a very good young scientist.
He's... he's got a good brain.
He's methodical, his experiments are well drawn up.
Look, I mean, it's just, uh...
it's excellent work all round.
-Good. -It's just this, Mrs Darcy. I'm...
I'm a...
I'm a bit concerned about him.
Concerned? Concerned how? What's he done?
No, he hasn't done anything. He's, um...
He's just been a bit, uh...
withdrawn.
Why is he withdrawn?
Everything's been all right at home?
Yes, yes. It's all fine.
Everything OK with your, um...
hairdresser?
Him? No, but-but yes. Uh...
He's withdrawn?
Well, I don't mean to alarm you.
- Sorry about that. Yep, exactly. - Mr Walliker, sorry, sorry.
We're a couple of minutes early, but these sessions are so short.
And I have more than a few questions for you.
You don't mind, do you, Bridget?
We do have the two boys, so...
Not at all. No. That's... It's fine.
- Mate, I'm gonna have to put you on mute. - -Thank you.
- Right. - I've got parents' evening.
Mark Darcy, the leading
international humanitarian rights lawyer,
was killed this morning in the Darfur region in Sudan.
...a land mine. The 55-year-old was in
the war-torn region after joining international efforts...
Mr Darcy was a leading international figure in human rights
and crisis resolution...
...gained global recognition
with the Kafir Aghani and Eleanor Heaney case,
which, of course, he won.
He leaves behind his wife, Bridget Jones,
and their two young children, Billy and Mabel.
More on this story as we get it.
Dearest darling Mark,
it's your birthday on Sunday, and...
...I'm just no good at doing this on my own.
I'm sorry I'm such a bad mother.
I'm sorry I got caught up with a callow toy boy.
I'm sorry I'm late for school and that Billy's withdrawn.
They're growing up without you.
How is Billy going to understand
how to be a man without his father?
How is Mabel going to live her life
having never really known you at all?
Please forgive me for being upset
about anything which isn't about not having you.
Please help me find a way to do this
without feeling like I'm ruining the most important part of my life.
The only part that still has you in it.
I have to put down how many tickets we need for my Christmas concert.
-Mm-hmm. -Should I put down two? For you and Mabel?
Put three.
Mabel, me and Chloe.
OK. Three.
Finished.
Me too.
Daddy will love these.
They're perfect.
Yes.
Did you write one, Mummy?
I did.
Tomorrow, can we post them to Daddy?
Of course we can.
And Mark's birthday came as it always did...
like all the celebrations, Christmases and anniversaries.
All the love and all the pain.
OK. Ready?
On three.
One, two...
What am I going to do when I get to--
...three.
What I have is what I love most in the world.
Billy and Mabel.
Just the three of us.
- Mr Walliker. - Mrs Darcy.
Billy!
- Hello! - Hello!
Ready?
♪ If you say that you are mine♪
♪ I'll be here till the end Of time♪
♪ So you got to let me know♪
♪ Should I stay Or should I go?♪
♪ Should I stay Or should I go now?♪
♪ Should I stay Or should I go now?♪
♪ If I go There will be trouble♪
♪ And if I stay It will be double♪
♪ So you gotta let me know♪
♪ Should I stay Or should I go?♪
Have a good walk, then.
Thank you.
Bye.
All right, come in.
Now...
what this is not is a "walk."
We are about to embark as a team
on an orienteering adventure.
- So do you each have your compasses? - -Yes!
-Do you each have your maps? -Yes!
Right then, you know your groups. Hands up, Otters!
You'll go along with Mr Collins and Bikram's mum, Mrs Pasricha.
Billy's mum, Mrs Darcy. You've drawn the short straw, I'm afraid.
You'll be joining me and the Ospreys.
Now, this is very important.
Remember to open your eyes and look around.
This is one of the most
beautiful places on earth.
Enjoy it.
Let's go.
-You sure you're up to this, Mrs Darcy? -Absolutely!
I was a Queen's Guide.
Got my Pioneer badge.
I can rope, knot, splice and lash.
If you need anything tied up,
I'm your girl.
- Right then. - Bring up the rear.
Yes! Bringing up the rear!
Up!
We're gonna see much more water than that.
Up the rear!
Yep.
Make sure everybody's with us.
You can see the second waterfall, can't you?
Well, those two are together.
Coming!
Hurry along. Come on!
- Give me your hand. - Wow. So cool.
OK.
Right.
Is there a Wi-Fi password?
Oh, Atticus, don't be a pillock.
All right, take this tarp
and spread it out on the floor over there, all right?
Come on.
It's all right. It's dry.
Mrs Darcy, could you take that wheelbarrow,
pick up some firewood for when the rain stops?
Yep.
All right, everyone. Do your best to get dry.
Ding-fucking-dong.
Whenever you're ready.
Looks like we'll be here for a while.
It really is absolutely disgusting.
Burnt to a crisp.
I think you'll find it's a brûlée.
Come on, then.
Off to Bedfordshire.
Goodnight, Mr Walliker.
- Here we are. - Sleep well, team.
- Well done today. - Thank you.
Okay. Night night.
Goodnight.
Mission accomplished.
One barnful of sleeping children.
Don't get me wrong, I'm quite impressed by your resourcefulness,
but who travels to the Lake District
with a backpack full of marshmallows?
All parents know the marshmallow
is an essential tool, Mr Walliker.
Do you have children?
Uh, no. No, no, I never did any of that.
But, um...
It's funny. In the back of your mind,
you think it might happen, and--
But, you know, one day,
you're preparing a test for a periodic table...
...and you realise it's the 27th one you've set,
and there's just never been time
to really think about having anything like a...
like a family in between.
But it's good.
It's good. I, uh...
Well, it suits me.
I see it does.
I mean, look at that.
All of it.
You asked me where's the wonder and the magic.
It's a good question.
I think it's here.
You don't believe in magic, Mr Walliker.
No.
Well, I've been thinking.
Mummy?
Atticus is really frightened.
He says his mum sings Puccini to him when he's scared.
Well, he might have to settle for some early Take That,
but I'll see what I can do, okay?
Mr Walliker,
do you mind if I sit here for a minute?
Of course. Sit down.
-Is there anything you want to-- -It's just...
what if I forget him?
I don't wanna forget him.
But what if I do?
Let me tell you this, Billy, um...
Your dad is everywhere.
He's everywhere.
Right now...
in this moment.
And that's a scientific fact.
Energy is only transferred.
It can never be destroyed.
And more importantly,
your father is in you.
And Mabel.
Billy, tell me something...
one thing...
that you remember best
about your dad.
Can we?
-May we. -Yes.
Careful!
Chop-chop.
One, two. One, two.
May I have your hot chocolate?
- No. No! Marshmallows! - Yes. Yes.
Mabel, why don't I take you to your seat? Come on.
Is that all right?
-Don't dawdle, Mrs Darcy. -No.
Show's starting.
Yes, of course.
- That sounds fantastic. - Yeah.
I'll see you at Nobu at 7.00.
Oh, for God's sake, Victor.
Fucking prick.
Bravo! Bravo.
Thank you, Eros and Atticus Soltani-Watkins.
Now, although it's not on the programme,
we do have one-- one more song.
Um, I happen to know it means a lot to our singer.
And, um... well, this is his first-ever solo performance,
and I know he'll do himself proud.
♪ I'd do anything♪
♪ For you, dear, anything♪
♪ For you mean everything♪
♪ To me♪
♪ I know that♪
♪ I'd go anywhere♪
♪ For your smile, anywhere♪
♪ For your smile♪
♪ Everywhere I'd see♪
♪ Would you climb a hill?♪
♪ Anything♪
♪ Wear a daffodil? Anything♪
♪ Leave me all your will? Anything♪
♪ Even fight my Bill?♪
♪ What? Fisticuffs?♪
♪ I'd risk everything♪
♪ For one kiss, everything♪
♪ Yes, I'd do anything♪
♪ Anything♪
♪ For you♪
Go, Billy!
Bravo!
Oh, my darling.
Daddy would be so proud of you.
I know.
Well done, Billy. You nailed it.
-Were you surprised, Mum? -Yes.
-Genius. -Up top.
-So, can I have a sleepover with Bikram? -Yes.
-And did you bring my-- -Yes.
Bikram! Nintendo!
Mr Walliker, Billy was...
The whole thing was...
-It was-- -It was magic, Mrs Darcy.
No, it wasn't.
What you've done for Billy...
People talk about moving on like it means,
you know, leaving something behind,
you know, leaving someone you love behind,
but perhaps it's more that suddenly you see
you can live at the same time as all the things you've lost,
and that you can be happy even without them.
And tonight, I saw my son up there
and I understood for the first time in four years
that he's going to be okay.
And so, we're going to be okay.
And you did that, Mr Walliker.
It wasn't magic.
It was you.
So, I'll overlook your tendency to be a little aloof--
Some might call it condescending.
Supercilious is a good word
and you probably don't hear it enough, but the point is...
thank you.
Mr Walliker?
We're going to The Spaniards for a drink.
Um, and if you wanted to come,
well, we'd be there
because that's where we'll be.
Can't be taught. Can't be taught. It was unbelievable.
-Mrs Darcy. -The flautists, an absolute triumph.
One of the best Christmas shows I've ever seen.
Christmas shows don't get much better than that. Extraordinary.
No, it doesn't. Don't look at me like that.
- Billy! How did it go? - Billy!
- I did a solo. - Oh!
Congratulations.
Come here. Have a squidge.
He was brilliant.
- Hello, Mabel. How are you? -Well done. I bet you were.
- Chloe has a video. - You look lovely.
- There's a video? - A video?
Chloe? Video?
Congratulations.
large glasses of white wine, please.
Wine. Wine.
Oh, house white. Party petrol.
- Bikram's here! - Your wine, ladies.
- What are you doing down there? - Nothing.
- Well, there we go. - Congratulations, darling.
-To Billy. -He was wonderful. Billy.
- Absolutely wonderful. - Yes.
But I can tell you, I... I knew from his glow it was a triumph.
No, honestly.
I mean, once you've tasted success...
You had literally one song, Tom.
Yes, you know, my mother always says
if you've got nothing nice to say, then shut the fuck up.
Your mother's right, so shut the fuck up.
We should never shut the fuck up.
Stop telling everyone else to shut the fuck up.
We can, yes.
- No. Come on. - Good overtaking.
No, I didn't. That was him.
Mum. That way.
Mr Walliker!
Aren't you coming in?
Well, actually, I was. I...
I wanted to say something to you,
but it's the wrong time.
You're there with everyone, and...
I'm better with people about 4 foot tall.
4'1". That's my sweet spot, as it turns out, so...
Where are you going?
Well, look, I really just wanted to discuss Newton.
Newton?
I mean, we already covered Newton's second law, gravity,
in the tree when you were pretending not to be stuck.
But the one that's always fascinated me isn't the second law.
I mean, any idiot can see that an apple's gonna fall down.
What's it gonna do, fall up?
It's a hopelessly overrated law, the second.
No, the one that's always interested me is the third law.
You'll know what that is.
Yes.
Of course. But go on.
For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
It's a fundamental law of our universe.
It's, uh... It's an inescapable fact of our existence,
and I was coming to say that you are...
this force, Mrs Darcy...
to me.
Equal and... opposite.
And just as Newton predicted, it's irresistible.
I see it.
Right now, just standing here, I feel it,
and it's as real to me as the things I loved when I was a boy
and first started looking at the world.
You see, it's not really order
that we science people fall in love with, Mrs Darcy,
it's the beauty in things.
The beauty,
to be specific...
in you.
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.
-I don't know what I was thinking. -No, no.
This is exactly why I decided not to come in.
I've clearly got entirely the wrong end of the--
-Mr Walliker... -Look, I just want you to know
that this is not going to be awkward at all. At all.
- Please stop talking. - With Billy and school.
Let's just pretend this never happened, please. Let's just--
It was either that or a whistle,
and I haven't got a whistle, Mr Walliker.
Call me Scott, for God's sake.
Yes, Mr Walliker.
Right, shake it, shake it, shake it. No, go mad.
That's it. Now pour it out.
Very good.
Insert one cherry.
And that, my friends, is how we make a Dirty Bitch.
Christ. That may even be a Filthy Bitch. Pass that round.
Now, similar but not at all the same,
the Bad Mummy.
Little bit of vodka.
-Yeah? -Come here.
Okay, you're in charge.
Is that who I think it is?
So they tell me, yeah. What do you think?
You have sad eyes, angelo mio.
Why so sad? They make me sad.
I want to see the smile.
Stop it.
He's 16!
Yeah. Late starter.
Where in Italy are you from?
-Bologna. -Bologna.
-Yeah. -Say it again.
- Bologna. - Bologna.
Enzo, the kids are gonna watch a movie upstairs. You coming?
He'll stay.
Boys.
I think you're proud.
Relief, really, Jones.
Kin, as you said.
-Enzo. -Yeah?
Vieni qua.
-I beg your pardon. -Okay.
-Ciao. -Ciao.
This is your hostess
and one of the great loves of your father's life, Bridget Jones.
It's nice to meet you, Enzo.
He says it is a great honour to meet you.
And then he says that those are
very, very silly little boots.
You have incredible posture.
You're not Danish, are you?
Well, I can be anything you want.
It is, isn't it? I know, and it's working really well for you,
but all I'm saying is maybe it's time for a rebrand.
Have you ever thought about having a pixie cut?
No.
Oh, you have the face for it.
And it's utterly changed my life.
Nonsense, Pam. You're perfect just as you are.
Is that a Dirty Bitch?
Steady on.
Oh, yes, please. Yes, thank you very much.
Thanks.
- Just what the doctor ordered. - -Me too.
-Always. Take a horn. -Give me the fucking horn.
- Thank you, thank you. - Yep.
I'll be honest, I don't know what I'd have done in the past 20 years without you lot.
-Twenty? -No, it's not. It's thirty?
Yeah, it's more like 30 years, to be honest.
We've had some fucking fun though, haven't we?
We have.
Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six, five,
four, three,
two, one!

Happy New Year.
I thought I was supposed to fight evil. I thought that was the whole point.
God, why do you have to argue about everything?
I'm your mother. I think you'll be safer in France.
I don't see how.
Is Auntie Tera a vampire hunter? No.
So, will I be safer with her? No.
I should be here with you, fighting evil.
I'm sorry, Richter.
I know it feels like I'm sending you away.
You are sending me away.
I'm so sorry, my darling.
But I have no choice.
Don't listen to her, Richter.
There's always a choice.
Julia Belmont.
Finally.
Olrox.
Go to the ship, Richter.
I'll catch you up.
You've made a big mistake.
My mom is gonna slice you in two.
In 250 years,
do you know how many vampire hunters have promised to slice me in two?
Now, Richter. Go to the ship.
Come on, Mom.
Richter!
Fuck!
Mom.
I'm sorry, Richter.
I'm so sorry.
Little boy Belmont.
I know that feeling.
That pain.
That hate.
That burning, unendurable need for retribution.
Because, you see,
your mama took someone from me I loved,
just as much as you loved her.
So, she had to die.
Oh, I could kill you too.
And I will.
One day.
But not tonight.
They claim it's the natural order.
They're born rich, and we're born poor.
And that's just the will of God.
It's the natural order for them to get rich by milking us dry
with impossible rents and unpayable taxes.
My mother hasn't paid her taxes for years now
because she's just too poor.
Sooner or later they'll send around their bully boys.
And you all know what I mean by that.
They thought it would stay like that until the end of time.
Well, the king thought it was his divine right to be king,
but do you know what happened to him?
He's been arrested.
The government in Paris has overthrown the monarchy and declared a republic.
To hell with the natural order.
No more kings, no more aristocrats.
Vive la Révolution!
Vive la Révolution!
Stay close. Stay together. Don't run into the woods.
You can kill me, Richter Belmont, but it won't do you any good.
Before the moon is full, the Vampire Messiah will come,
the Devourer of Light, who will eat the sun.
You will suffer and die along with everyone you love.
That makes absolutely no sense.
I told you this was a damn stupid place for a revolutionary meeting.
We'll just have to start holding them in the town.
I'm just worried people won't come.
Maria, if they're more scared of gossips than they are vampires,
maybe they're not, you know, revolutionary material.
What did it mean by the "Vampire Messiah"?
Who knows? What a ridiculous concept.
It might explain why there seem to be more vampires around lately.
They're gathering somewhere.
The château, I wouldn't wonder.
Well, it's where I'd go if I was a vampire.
Want to go and check?
Jacques, let's get everyone back to town.
"The Devourer of Light," it said.
That sounds bad.
Why come here? What's so special about here?
Ham and beans.
The local ham and beans is pretty sensational,
makes local blood nice and smoky.
God, you're a wanker.
Maybe we should discuss this with the Abbot.
I know he's no friend to the Revolution,
but he can't be much of a friend to vampires either.
And he's got his soldier-monks. Strength, after all, in numbers.
You're right.
I am?
We propose a temporary alliance.
They help us see what's happening, and then they help us fight.
What, now? I thought you might want to argue me to death about it.
Maybe don't tell him about the magic birds, though.
He knows you kill vampires.
I have a reputation.
And people accept it, because of the heroic and handsome thing.
But teenage girls conjuring creatures from the Otherworld?
They start building piles of very flammable wood.
You talk like I don't know when to keep my mouth shut.
Hi, Mizrak. We need to speak to the Abbot.
Think he's praying.
I'm sure if you want to pray with him, he won't mind.
We're not here to pray.
We killed three vampires tonight, out in the woods near the château,
and one of them said something about a Vampire Messiah.
They say they have urgent business about vampires.
Time was, there were hardly any.
Last couple of years, I'd kill one every few months or so.
For which Machecoul is forever grateful.
But this was three in one night.
Three in one night.
So, something's up. Something big.
Before it died, one of them warned me, which was nice of it,
that a Vampire Messiah is on its way.
The Devourer of Light, apparently.
Devourer of Light.
Which might explain why the vampires are congregating at the château.
Vampires? At the château?
Where else would they go?
The Marquis is a pillar of this community,
like his family before him for generations.
For centuries.
I can't believe he would welcome vampires into his home.
He's not a pillar of this community.
Before the Revolution, he spent all his time at court
and probably forgot we existed, even though his wealth
is thanks to the pain and suffering of every peasant within 40 miles.
Oh, Maria.
It breaks my heart to hear you like this, parroting the phrases of the Godless mob.
- The Godless...? - No good will come of all this hatred.
Hatred and envy and division.
It will only lead to bloodshed and greater suffering.
But I pray for you.
And for you, Richter Belmont.
I know how much pain is in your soul.
How much sadness and loss.
That's good of you, really, but...
We... We appreciate it, the praying.
But we think vampires are gathering at the château,
and maybe this is the reason.
We can go and look for ourselves, see if it is just innocent nobles,
with their teeth stained by nothing worse than vintage claret,
but we could use some help.
All right. I'll see what I can find out.
I have my spies.
Don't do anything rash.
The Marquis won't thank us for besmirching his good name,
but, of course,
if he has thrown his doors open to the undead,
we can go together and burn them all to dust.
Whatever our differences, Maria,
we have a common enemy in evil.
Though evil can be more subtle than is often supposed.
Thank you.
"I have my spies."
Ooh, spies. Spies everywhere.
They are everywhere, Richter. The whole town.
It's why we go to the woods.
We did the right thing, though. Speaking to him.
And you were good as gold.
Definitely know when to keep your mouth shut.
Well, there's only so much pious bullshit I can stand.
Maybe you should practice.
Go for a drink, if you want.
We promised your mother we'd come home.
- So, we go home. - In other words, you're hungry.
She's cooking dinner. How rude do you think I am?
Every single day, every moment in Versailles,
there was something exciting, entertaining to do...
...but here, even the peasants...
What is it about you peasants out here that makes everything, even your blood,
so unremittingly dull?
People don't need me to tell them their lives are tough.
But they're suspicious of the Revolution.
They get told lies about everything by people they think they can trust.
The Abbot's a good man, Maria. And what he says, it's not lies.
Not to him.
You said it yourself, people trust him.
I'm sorry, Richter.
- ...believed the Church for centuries. - I'm so sorry.
The world is changing. Even here in Machecoul.
The world is changing.
Tonight, for instance. Before the vampire attack,
people were really listening.
Weren't they, Richter?
What?
People were really listening tonight.
Well, I wasn't.
Why do you kill vampires, then? If you're so uninterested.
It's the most fun you can have with your clothes on.
He's a Belmont. Bless him.
He has a destiny.
I don't believe in destiny.
You don't believe in anything. It's because they're evil, Richter.
Vampires? Evil? Oh, my God. Are you sure?
And evil has to be fought.
I believe in you and your mother.
I believe you're the kindest, most courageous people in the world.
So, I don't need to understand the things you believe in,
and I certainly don't need to believe in them too.
I just need to stand by you.
Always.
You're such a dick.
What the fuck are you?
- Do you know what they are? - No.
Well, whatever they are,
I'm sure they can die.
Those were night creatures, weren't they?
I don't know what they were. I've never seen anything like them.
They were night creatures.
Demons made from human corpses grafted onto souls from hell.
Nobody's made any for centuries.
Who are you?
Obviously you're a witch, but where did you come from?
Whoever you are... thank you.
They don't just happen. Someone has to make them.
What are you talking about? Who are you?
And that would take a Forgemaster.
A sorcerer, magician, necromancer.
Of great, great power.
There must be a Forgemaster around here.
Can you answer my questions?
My name is Annette.
And I am Edouard.
We're from the island of Saint-Domingue, in the Caribbean Sea.
Across the ocean?
We're looking for someone called Belmont.
That would be the ungrateful wanker.
I don't suppose you know anything about a Vampire Messiah?
Yes.
That's why we're here.
Good of you to meet me, Vaublanc, but I can make my own way.
Still...
you can tell your Messiah...
I'm here.
This so-called Revolution,
it's not a struggle for the rights of man.
It's an abomination, an affront to the natural order,
to common decency,
above all,
to God and his church.
My own holy order, the Knights of Saint John,
founded to protect pilgrims in the wars for the Holy Land,
has been commanded to submit to the blasphemous, Godless state.
We would rather die.
But whatever atrocities they commit
in the names of their sacrilegious future,
the days of this abomination will soon be over.
A deliverer is at hand.
A new Joan of Arc,
a mighty warrior queen to lead us to salvation.
She will raise a holy army of the righteous
to crush the blasphemers.
In the name of God.
In the name of God.
Name your business in the Commune of Paris.
This is Paris, is it?
What a dump.
I'm a representative of the Insurrectionary Commune of Paris.
State your business.
I'm a representative too, of the Messiah.
Religious orders need to register with the National Convention.
Not that Messiah.
The real one.
I don't know if I should bury it.
Come on. I need help with breakfast.
I've heard about the revolution in Saint-Domingue, of course,
but the Paris papers only reach here sometimes,
and then about six months late.
So I know the slaves rose up, burned all the sugar plantations,
and killed all the bastard slave owners.
Not quite all. One escaped.
Many white colonists were vampires.
The island was teeming with all kinds of evil.
And it's not over yet, our revolution.
I'll call a meeting.
It will be so inspiring.
Representatives from another revolution.
- You were slaves then, were you? - Annette was.
I was an opera singer.
Oh my God.
This bread.
We've been living off ship rations for weeks.
If I never eat another strip of dried meat for as long as I live...
Yeah, and fuck knows what kind of meat it even is.
You've spent time on a ship?
I sailed here from Boston when I was a boy.
Worst few weeks of my life.
I didn't think it was humanly possible to vomit so often.
Nor did I.
Annette found my suffering hilarious.
Everything's an opera, even puking over the side of a ship.
Tell me what you know about this Vampire Messiah.
In Saint-Domingue, there's a mambo, a priestess, my teacher.
She's a powerful sorcerer and seer.
It was she who told me to find you.
And she knows about this Messiah?
She said, "Something is changing out here in the Old World."
For centuries, vampires have lived coiled around the old houses of Europe,
like vines.
Close allies of the dukes and barons, the principalities,
even the royal courts themselves.
That's amazing.
But many vampires resented their reliance on human kings and princes.
This Messiah promises to make them unquestioned masters of the world.
Won't that be fun.
They'll leave the kings and princes in place,
but with vampires pulling the strings,
which means, first, they need to crush the Revolution.
Oh, what a surprise.
The evil Messiah is on the side of the old regime.
The priestess told me you could do magic.
I could when I was a kid.
What happened?
I don't know.
Never mind. We'll make do.
The Messiah was a monster before she was a vampire.
She?
Even as a human, she tortured and murdered young girls and boys.
What's her name? The Vampire Messiah, do you know her name?
Erzsebet Bathory.
Countess Erzsebet Bathory.
Mum, what's wrong?
Oh, no.
Mum?
Oh, yes.
She'll do nicely.
The Messiah will be pleased.
I never really told you why I fled from Russia.
You... said you had no choice.
That's true.
But I never really told you who I had to leave behind.
I thought... I hoped...
that it was locked away in the past and far away in the East...
and you were safe from it.
But of course you're not safe.
I was born 4,000 miles to the east, in Russia,
by the banks of a great river.
People were poor, cruelly treated.
So, my family, a clan of Speakers,
settled there for a while to help ease their suffering.
And for a while, we were free.
But, of course, our freedom couldn't be tolerated.
So the soldiers came.
And not only soldiers. There were vampires too.
None worse than Erzsebet Bathory
and her attack dog, Drolta Tzuentes.
So, you fled.
Not yet.
They captured my sister.
I didn't know you had a sister.
I tried to save her.
Erzsebet Bathory doesn't simply kill her victims.
She tortures them for as long as she can keep them alive.
Rejoices in the most terrible agony she can inflict.
I fled...
...leaving her and everyone I knew and loved.
West, and further west, to places I didn't even know existed.
Until I finally found refuge here.
I should have told you before.
There are things that I don't talk about either.
She will bring horror beyond nightmares.
Suffering and pain beyond endurance.
She won't want simply to crush the Revolution,
she will want to drain it slowly of blood,
before she grinds its bones to dust.
But we will defeat her.
Yeah, don't you worry.
We're going to fucking kill her.
Do you feel close to these creatures?
They come when I call.
They do what I command.
Mm, well, ask. I don't really command them.
But, yes, it feels like, for a little while, they're part of me.
So, part of you has died.
Like part of you died with your sister.
I'll sing for them both.

This Marquis, you believe vampires are gathering at his château?
Yes.
It makes sense. It's where vampires would go.
We should investigate and burn it to the ground if we have to.
It's getting late.
You should wait.
For another attack?
We needed to rest, but now we're wasting time.
We'll stay out of sight. Just get a sense of numbers.
Then I'll come with you.
You need to rest, and we need to stay hidden.
Frankly, four is already too many.
I promise...
We'll be careful.
We'll be safe.
Thousands of years ago, before any church or anything,
the people who built stone circles communed with what they called
the Otherworld.
Sounds like the spirit world, where Annette's ancestors live.
Generation upon generation of ancestors,
back to Ogun, an orisha, a god.
The god of iron and war.
She's descended from a god?
That's on my father's side.
On her mother's, it's Orunmila,
an orisha of wisdom and divination.
Apparently.
Anyway, it gives her power over metal and rock.
We're all descended from gods.
We just have to learn how to draw on their power.
Well, I'm quite happy with my whip and my knives, thank you.
Generation upon generation of my ancestors have killed vampires with just this whip.
Actually, quite a lot of them could do magic,
including my mother, but it's never been essential.
Where's your mother?
She died.
Some vampires do magic too.
It's like Versailles emptied, and its dregs washed up here.
That's him.
That's the Marquis.
Poor devils.
He's giving them the corpses.
- Why? - To make more.
The Marquis has some kind of deal with the Forgemaster.
Follow those night creatures, we find their maker.
It's Jacques.
I saw him only yesterday.
Oh my God.
It's the vampire who enslaved her and murdered her mother,
the Comte de Vaublanc.
He looks like he's found God.
Papa Legba, open the gate.
Annette, not now.
Annette.
We need to get out of here!
Go.
Maria! We need to go!
Now!
Annette! We need a bridge!
Annette!
Richter!
Well, well...
Glory be to God.
Hey. How you doin' in there?
You sitting comfortably? All settled in? Okay, good.
Now, listen.
I'm gonna tell you a story.
It's all about the time we escaped from a chicken farm.
There was this farmer, see?
And she absolutely hated chickens.
Kept them locked up like prisoners.
I guess you could say she had a real axe to grind.
Got herself a machine that turned chickens into pies.
We mustn't panic!
But what she didn't plan on was going toe to toe
with a certain freedom-fighting chick.
She was fierce, fearless, and wanted one thing and one thing only.
Freedom.
She pulled us all together...
...and gave us the wings to fly right outta that hen-hole.
She got every chicken out of there.
And got rid of that wicked farmer to boot.
Bye-bye.
And you know who that freedom-fighting chicken was?
Your very own mom.
Rocky, don't you think bedtime stories might be a bit premature?
Well... I mean, you're never too young to learn where you came from.
But those days are over, thank goodness.
We've got our happy ending.
We're living in it.
Your way, Mac.
More fruit coming, Bunty.
Oh! Oh, thanks, Mac, 'cause I'm working up a thirst here.
Good work, Bunty. Keep it up.
You know what?
I think it's time to put the past behind us.
- Turned out nice again. - Ooh, yeah. Lovely.
Past?
What past?
That past, behind us.
But these, these are our glory days.
That's who we are.
It's who we were.
We went through all that so our baby doesn't have to.
Y'know, you are right.
From now on, our only mission is to keep our baby safe.
Don't you worry. Ol' Rocky here is on the case.
What do I do? What do I do?
- Whoo-hoo! - It's hopping!
Just grab it!
Oh no!
Egg's up!
Good grief. A live shell.
Clear the area!
- Whoo-hoo! - Oh! Get it!
- Watch out! - Huh?
No!
Would you look at that.
We've got ourselves a family.
Oh, look at her, Rocky.
She's perfect.
Welcome to the world.
- Molly. - Mm.
Ah, what a bonny wee hen.
Oh, she's got her father's spindly little legs.
We need to build them up, what, what.
When I was in the RAF, we did 50 squats before breakfast.
That's gone.
- I made her a bicycle. - Really?
Oh. You knitted one.
What a lovely... thought.
Thank you, Babs.
Y'know, I'd say our little island paradise just got a little more
"paradisier."
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Molly! No, no, no, no! Stop that pram!
- That's my brave little girl. - Yes! You're doing great!
- Ooh. No, no, no, no. - No, no, no!
Molly, that's a bit too brave.
Careful up there, sweetheart. Hold on to the sides.
- Hold on to it. - Ah.
- Whee! - Oh no! No, no, no!
- Outrageous! - ♪ Cherry pie, buttercup ♪
- Anyone for tea? - Ooh, yeah. Cuppa tea.
Hey, boys. Welcome back.
We have got some quality old junk for you today, Rocky, mate.
- Here you go. - Molly, hold on to this for Daddy.
- All right. Well, nice to see ya. - See you next month.
- Hiya, hen. - Huh?
Mm, bye-bye.
No, you cheater! Cheater!
See you later.
- Hello! - Morning.
- Hello! Morning! - Morning!
- Hiya! - Morning, pet!
Hi, Mum.
- Oh. Hello, darling. - Hi, Dad!
Uncle Nick! Uncle Fetcher!
She just called me "uncle."
Steady, mate. Steady.
But I've never had a family of me own.
Me neither.
Mum, I was thinking. Can we go over there?
Where, love?
The other side of the water.
Oh, we've spoken about this, Molly.
There's nothing over there for us.
What about stuff Uncle Nick and Fetch bring?
Isn't that for us?
Hey. What's up, Ginge?
Rocky.
Molly's asking about going off the island.
Oh, right.
Oh, right.
Do you wanna see the world's coolest invention?
Okay.
What is it, Dad?
Only the answer to all of life's problems.
Popcorn.
Is that the best thing ever or what?
- Mm! It is good. - "Good"?
This is great !
Life, my girl, doesn't get better than this.
- Mum, what is it? - It's nothing to worry about, Molly.
Nothing at all.
Well, it was only a matter of time before the humans showed up.
It looks like they're taking them to some kind of chicken farm.
I haven't seen that look in a long while.
You can't right all the world's wrongs, duck.
Meeting tonight. Spread the word.
Here we go again.
What's going on, Mum?
Why can't I go up my tree anymore? What's this meeting about?
It's nothing, Molly.
It's, um, just...
There's some quite big wasps up there this year.
Really?
Besides, I need someone to stay here and look after your dad.
Don't worry. I'm good.
Okay.
Maybe while you're out, he can tell me a story.
Good idea.
Good night, my big, brave girl.
Good night, Ginge. Good luck.
Okay, Mollypod. What do you wanna do?
Well, I thought you could tell me about... this.
Uh, uh, uh, that... that is... not me.
Okay. Yes, it's me. But it was a long time ago.
And?
And,
actually,
it's a... it's a pretty good story.
It's not just eggs they want from us.
Ginger has that look about her.
I reckon she'll have us charging right into the fray.
I don't want to charge into any frays.
I... I'm fray-phobic.
- All right, everyone! Please, quiet! - Wait. She's starting.
- Quiet! - Shut your beak.
Now, we all know about the new road.
And the trucks taking chickens to what looks like some kind of farm.
A farm?
No, it's all right, Beryl. Listen. Listen.
We know from experience what that can mean.
It's something we just can't ignore.
We really only have one choice.
I don't want to hear it.
We've got to do something.
We have to hide.
Hide?
Yes. Hide!
You mean, pretend we're not here?
Exactly.
Operation Lie Low. Jolly good.
Ooh! I like lilos. Especially the stripy ones.
She's right, you know.
- It's really not our problem. - Oh, you!
Are you all right, hen?
It's not like you to shy away from danger.
I know, but I have Molly to think about now.
And I...
We can't risk our freedom
by venturing into a world that finds chickens so...
delicious.
Lift!
Right.
All we have to do now is keep quiet and not draw attention to ourselves.
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Rocky!
Um, given our new situation, maybe you shouldn't crow anymore.
Don't crow?
What? But that's, like, my thing.
Maybe you could do a different thing.
A quieter one?
Wow! Look at this!
Molly! Get away from that.
- Ginge, can we talk about the whole... - She's right, you know.
Careless squawks cost lives.
We have to lie low.
I'm running a camouflage lesson at noon.
If you can find me.
What's it for, Mum?
Oh! What is that?
It's got a chicken sitting in a bucket on it.
It's doing this.
Oh, that's so funny.
Uh, let's go home.
Where are they going? Can we go with them?
- It looks like a lot of fun. - I'm sorry, Molly.
- You're not ready to go off the island. - But I...
Uh, Rocky? Little help?
Maybe I could crow on weekends. Y'know?
Why am I not ready?
I'm a big, brave girl.
- You always say so. - I know.
But you're still a child.
Says who?
Says me and your dad.
Right, Rocky?
Yeah, that's right. That's right. Yes. Listen to your mom, kiddo.
Oh! Oh. How about just half a crow? Like a "cock-a" or "doodle-doo"?
Something that's a little shorter.
Well, I'm going over to see those trucks because I am a Lone Free Ranger.
Like Dad was.
I've seen his poster.
He used to live over there, and you did too.
Did I say that? I don't... I don't remember.
That's it.
Molly, you are not leaving this island.
You can't make me stay here. You're not the boss of me.
Actually, I am.
Look, Molly, you've got everything you want right here.
Except for one thing.
And what's that?
Freedom.
You know, she is a lot like you.
Your daughter is going to be delicious!
Not the face! Not the face!
- Huh? - Molly?
Molly?
- Come out, Molly! - Molly!
- Molly? - Molly?
- Molly! - Molly!
- Molly? - Molly!
Come out, Molly.
No!
She's left the island.
This isn't so bad.
Don't know what Mum was worried about.
I'm big and I'm brave.
Yeah, course I am.
I'm big...
And...
...not very brave.
What were you doin'? Have you got a death wish?
No.
Wait, what's a death wish?
Isn't it a bit late for you to be out, baby girl?
I'm not a baby girl.
I'm a... I'm a big, brave girl.
And isn't it a bit late for you to be out too?
Okay, I like it.
Give as good as you get, eh?
Well, I'm Frizzle.
And you are?
Molly.
Although, it's kind of a goofy name.
So I'm thinking of changing it to...
Zip it, kidda.
It's stoppin'. Now's our chance.
- Are you comin' or not? - Coming where?
To the happy chicken truck.
You've seen them too?
Right.
Wherever that truck's goin',
it's gonna be cooler than a penguin's toenails.
Uh, what's a toenail?
What's a penguin?
Oh! You have got so much to learn. Come on.
Wait for me!
I mean, so she found my poster, and I told her a story.
I don't think that's such a big deal.
Oh no. It was perfectly sensible to encourage our daughter
to be a Lone Free Ranger.
You know, if you had it your way, she'd still be in her shell.
Well, better in her shell than out on the open road.
So, do you live on an island too?
Nah. I was stuck on a boring old farm.
Then the trucks came, and they said I was too small to go.
But that's not gonna stop me.
You get to sit in a bucket.
What chicken doesn't want their own bucket?
I want a bucket.
The thing about us, Mol,
is that we wanna go where we wanna go whenever we want.
Yeah. With nobody telling us what we can and can't do.
Me and you, kidda. All the way.
Holy moly.
Hear that? It's like a party in there.
What is that?
You've never seen a human before?
We had them back at the farm.
They're kinda stupid.
They fed us and tidied up after us. They're basically like waitin' staff.
- Oi, you! - Huh?
How did you two get out here?
- What do you say, Molly? - Uh...
Do you want to come on the adventure of a lifetime or not?
- Oh no! - Oh no!
Molly!
Ginger!
Molly!
I know what you're thinking.
Where are the buckets?
I bet they give 'em to us when we get there.
- Are we nearly there yet? - Molly!
Hello.
There go the goujons!
- Hang on, Fowler! - What do you think I'm doing?
Molly!
Well, hey. That doesn't look so bad.
Oh, that looks so bad.
Right. Stop here.
Let's have a look.
- Okay, all clear. - On your way.
We mustn't panic.
- No. No panicking. - I don't like it.
It's a perfect time to panic. The enemy has the upper hand.
We must keep our heads!
- Where should we keep them? - I'm trying to think here.
No panicking. No. I said no panicking!
- Ginger, what do you say? - What did I say?
I say, last time, we broke out of a chicken farm.
Well, this time, we're breaking in.
- It smells funny. - This is not what I expected.
This is, uh... cool, isn't it?
That's it, my lovelies.
Come on down.
I don't fancy that.
- Come on. - Huh?
Over here.
Did I promise you the adventure of a lifetime or what?
Come on. Let's play.
Yeah!
Let's go in the pool.
Listen, everyone. We can do this.
- We just need a really clever plan. - Ooh. Ooh.
Okay. I've got this. I've got this.
I'm gonna go in there, and I'm gonna bust Molly out.
And just how the bloomin' heck are you going to do that?
Well, by, uh... uh, y'know, going in there
and then... busting her out.
That's not a plan.
That's just saying what you wish would happen.
Aye, and 12 herrings and a bagpipe
are just a pile of mince if you havnae kent the rules.
You know, that sounded a little negative to me.
Mac's right. We need more details.
We only get one shot at this, so we need to make sure
that every move we make is carefully thought through.
We can't just rush in and...
Uh, Rocky?
What are you doing?
Sometimes you just gotta take a leap, Ginger.
- You ready, Fowler? - Ready.
- Fire. - Rocky.
Cock-a-doodle...
Ooh, that went well.
Well, one good thing.
At least now we've got the details.
Right. We're gonna need some backup.
No way. That place is impenetrable.
Yeah, and you can't get in neither.
It's an impossible mission.
Uh, shouldn't it be the other way around?
Don't be a 'nana, Fetch.
I know it looks like a million-to-one shot,
but we know the layout, and Mac thinks there's a way in.
This is Fun Land Farm.
It's much smaller than I expected.
Uh, thanks, Babs.
There's a wee side door in a blind spot.
With a cheeky wee trick to open it.
So, only the small matter of this electric fence.
All these guards.
The camera-driven gun-toting moles.
And the laser-guided exploding ducks.
Please. You've got to help us. Rocky's in there.
Ah, shame. I quite liked him.
And so is Molly.
Molly? Our little niece?
Steady, mate.
Stay strong.
- So you're in? - Just tell us what you need.
Anything for our little Molly!
We can do this, everyone.
Bunty, with your strength, my love, we can move mountains.
Mac, you're the brains.
Babs, you're our... wool specialist.
Nick and Fetch,
you're the sneakiest little toerags this side of the Dales.
- You're too kind. - Flatterer.
And, Fowler, with your wisdom and vigilance...
Fowler?
Ooh. And then the second wave of bombers approach the target,
and that's where I come in.
Actually, Fowler, we need to find something special for you.
Ah, right.
How about... getaway man?
Getaway man, eh?
Hmm. Sounds important.
I like it.
Right. Let's gather what we need and hurry.
Who knows what horrors Molly is dealing with in there.
- Wow! - This place is fun!
It's the most amazin' place ever.
And my mum said that's where we live.
Yeah, right.
Are the streets paved with marshmallows where you live?
Can ya bounce on them?
No! They're paved with dirt.
Can you lie around doin' nothin' all day?
Actually, my dad can.
Well, everyone can do that here.
Wow.
I've heard of this, but I never knew it actually existed.
Cool. What is it?
All-you-can-eat buffet.
Cooler than a penguin's toenails.
Right?
It's just, back home, I had jobs to do.
I helped Mac with the harvester, helped Bunty pick carrots,
made yarn with Babs.
But here, it's just play.
And then more play.
I wonder if they're missing me.
It's great, innit? We're free to do whatever we want.
Come on!
Sorry.
Uh... Frizzle!
There's actually something strange about this place.
I'll say.
Ever seen anything like this before?
Oh no, what's this?
You aren't supposed to be back there, number...
Hmm. You don't have a number?
We don't want chickens making any trouble here.
Especially not today.
Okay, everyone. It's go time.
It's all right. I went before we left.
What the... Huh?
No, you mug.
It's upside down.
Oh right.
Go! Go! Go!
Yup?
All clear.
Let's go.
Perfect landin'. Right on the button.
Right on the button?
Mm. Okay.
Let me out!
The camera!
I've got it.
"Getaway man," she said.
More like taxi driver for a couple of rats.
There. Textbook landing.
At ease, soldier.
I reckon they think I'm too old for this caper.
Some rambling old rooster who's easily distracted.
Hm. Oh, actually, there's quite an amusing story about that.
One time, I was out rambling...
Well, on maneuvers, and...
All right.
I'm inside.
Get off of me.
Nick, uh, I don't wanna worry you, but I think your bum just spoke.
Guys? What are you doin' here?
Rocky!
We're with Ginger. Uh, we've come to rescue ya.
Rescue me?
No, no. I'm doing the rescuing.
I'm not being rescued.
I am rescuing Molly.
How's that going, then?
Well...
Look, don't take this the wrong way, but you guys are just gonna hold me back.
I tend to work alone.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, the Lone Free Ranger.
Right? And I am close.
I can feel it.
I'm gettin' warm, boys.
Really warm, actually.
Can anyone smell roast chicken?
I said you'd hold me back!
Oh dear.
We actually planned that.
Did we?
Okay. I've gotta go find Molly.
Molly?
Hold it back, son. Hold it back.
Look at them.
- It's like they're all a bit... brainless. - Ah.
Erm. I don't think I like it here.
Yeah. It's not as much fun as it looked on the poster, is it?
Hey, Frizzle.
Maybe we should try and find out what's going on in this place.
Now, that sounds like a real adventure.
Come on.
Let's investigate.
Come on, now, you naughty little thing.
I'm just your big chicken friend who only wants you to be happy.
Frizzle!
What was that?
Hello.
Who are you?
What?
It's me. Molly.
Happy to meet you.
Frizzle, what's this?
Come on, Frizzle.
We've got to go.
But I've never been so happy.
No.
I'm big...
...and I'm brave.
Frizzle.
Listen. I'm going to find out what's going on here.
Then I will be back.
I promise.
Dr. Fry, your guest has arrived.
Sir Eat-a-Lot.
Right.
It's showtime.
Ah, Sir Eat-a-Lot! Welcome.
What an honor to have a knight of the realm with us.
Actually, Sir Eat-a-Lot is just the name of the restaurant.
My name is... Oh.
Here at Fun Land Farms,
we do everything we can to make our chickens feel right at home.
Well, I must say, I've never seen a farm like this before, Dr. Fry.
Is all this security really necessary?
Oh yes.
Molly.
You see, behind these doors are secrets
that will change the world of poultry technology forever.
Come on.
No!
Oi, what are you lot doing?
Attack!
This place is a maze.
How am I ever gonna find Molly in here?
- There she is. - Huh?
Molly?
Molly! Molly!
And, um, how's the restaurant business?
Actually, a little slow.
Oh well, I think we can help you with that.
Molly!
No! No!
Molly! Molly! Molly!
Ah. Ginger?
Right. I'm gone.
Well, can't we just take the lift?
All I can say, Dr. Fry, is this had better be...
good.
My, uh, partner will be joining us shortly.
In the meantime, we've prepared a little presentation.
Please, be seated.
This is an ordinary chicken.
Plain, dull, and easily frightened.
Like any simpleminded creature,
its natural instincts, when faced with processing,
is fear and panic.
When this occurs, the muscles tense,
which cause the connective tissues to form knots.
The result?
Meat that is tough, dry, and flavorless.
Mummy, this meat is tough, dry, and flavorless.
- I hate you, Mummy. - Oh!
Molly.
Fear not, underappreciated mother.
For what if science could change all that?
For what if science could alter a chicken's response to fear?
What if it could make a chicken happy to be processed?
Then you'd say, "Well done, science."
Because a happy chicken
is a tasty chicken.
This is the most delicious chicken in the whole wide world.
I love you, Mummy.
Thank you, science.
Molly.
That's a clever little cartoon, Dr. Fry.
But will you be able to do it?
We already have.
That voice.
Allow me to introduce my wife.
Melisha Tweedy.
Welcome to the future.
It's her.
Darling, this is Sir Eat-a-Lot.
The name is Reginald Smith.
Sir Eat-a-Lot is just the name of the restaurant chain.
Hello, Reginald.
I see you've met my current husband, Dr. Fry.
Was I attracted to his large inheritance and vast acres of land?
No, it was his mind.
You probably can't tell by looking at him, but he's a genius.
You flatter me, darling.
With degrees from Oxford and Cambridge in clinical neurology,
behavioral psychology, genetic engineering...
And drama!
Now you've had the appetizer,
time for the main course.
Come.
Molly, no. Get back.
Let me go!
Right. Try and find Molly.
Oh, look.
Rocky and the rats are on telly.
Looks like a real cliffhanger.
Where is she?
Oh, look.
They like the new egg cup ride.
Frizzle.
Mum?
Oh, Mollypod.
- Are you okay? - Yes.
Promise never to run away again.
- Did they hurt you? - I'm fine, but I think they eat...
- Come on. Get on with it. - Shh.
Right you are, pumpkin.
Behold.
The remote control.
And the other remote controls.
Why three?
Nobody knows.
Let's go with...
that one.
- Why am I playing golf? - Where am I?
- What am I doing? - Molly? Where are you, Molly?
What's going on?
No, no, no. Wrong one, my angel.
That's the off button.
Allow me.
It's me.
She's won the prize.
Oh wow.
What a lucky ducky!
No. Stop.
Run, chicken! Run!
Bye!
Have a nice time!
Look at me, and do not look away.
Behold,
the dawn of the nugget.
I love you, Mummy.
Um... Um, I... I... I mean, it's delicious.
Picture it.
On every street, in every town.
People on the go.
Modern people in a modern world.
They want their food, and they want it fast.
And we will give it to them by the bucketful.
Fast food.
I like it. This could be big.
No. It will be huge.
And Melisha Tweedy will have her revenge.
Revenge?
Revenue. That's what I meant.
I'll send a truck to collect the first batch at dawn tomorrow.
With my nuggets and your chain of restaurants,
this is going to be a beautiful partnership.
Uh, shall I see you to your car, Your Sirness?
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
No, wait. We can't go without Frizzle.
Frizzle? Who's Frizzle?
She's my friend. I can't just leave her.
I promised I'd come back.
Please, Molly. You don't understand.
But you saw what happens. She'll die.
And if we don't leave here now, then we will die too.
I don't care. I'm not leaving her here.
You are just a child,
and you have no idea who you're dealing with.
Bye-bye.
You!
Come back here!
Well now, the little escape artist.
You won't ruin this.
Not again.
Come back immediately, Doctor.
And bring a collar.
We've an unexpected guest.
Stop.
You're pushin' us too hard, cuz.
I ain't been this knackered
since I took that hamster wheel for a test-drive.
- Here she is. - Shh. Listen.
The miserable, malcontented chicken
that escaped Tweedy's Farm
and ruined my life.
What is this bloomin' place?
Molly, where are you?
Ooh! He's laddered me knitting.
Run!
I gave you all a hen could want.
A warm hut,
all the feed you could eat.
But you still weren't happy.
Well, I'm gonna make ya happy now.
Mum.
I've gotta get in there.
Ah, I've got an idea.
- You're the Lone Free Ranger, right? - Yeah.
You used to get shot out of a cannon, right?
That is all... Why?
It's not working. Turn up the power.
The equipment's in good order, my love.
I've just never seen a chicken so strong-willed.
You don't know the half of it.
Turn it up to full power.
Full power?
But we've never tested it at that.
Must I do everything myself?
Husbands and chickens, the bane of my life.
Sure you can make this work?
Oh yeah. There is nothing Fetch don't know about electrics.
He could chew through wiring before he could walk.
- Ready. - Great work, boys.
I'm ready to fly.
Goodbye, cuz.
Or should I say, "au revoir."
It's more likely goodbye, to be honest.
Let's go.
Come on, Mum.
Mum? Who's Mum?
You are. And we have to get out of here.
Why? I love it here.
I'm so happy.
No.
Dad?
Molly.
Right.
He's got some moves.
Mum, wait.
♪ We can't fly, we are chickens! ♪
Get him.
- Come here, you. - Oi!
Hey! Get him.
Find those chickens!
♪ I'm H-A-P-P-Y! ♪
♪ I'm H-A-P-P-Y! ♪
♪ I know I am! I'm sure I am! ♪
♪ I'm H-A-P-P-Y! ♪
- Come on! - Shush, Mum. We have to be quiet.
- But I want to sing! - Shh!
- Just follow me. - Oh, goody.
Are we going on holiday?
No, we have to find Frizzle and Dad and get out of here.
But why?
Because I say so.
Well, you're not the boss of me.
I can see my feet.
Where'd they go?
- Come on, Mum. - Come on!
- This way! - Cooee!
Wait up!
Come on. Let's get a shimmy on.
Ginger. Oh, thank heavens you escaped.
I can't believe we're back up against that horrible woman.
What? Mrs. Tweedy's the best.
- I love her. - Bunty.
- Mac. It's this collar. - She's the loveliest.
- It's making Mum act weird. - The bestest.
Molly!
Huh?
- Ha. Got him. - Uncle Nick?
Uncle Fetch.
How did you find us?
- We just fell down the air vent. - Love, Molly.
Love showed us the way.
Going up.
- Cooee! - Ginger!
Mum!
♪ I'm H-A-P-P-Y ♪
♪ I know I am ♪
- ♪ I'm sure I am ♪ - It won't budge.
- ♪ I'm H-A-P-P-Y ♪ - Ooh. Babs, what's in your bag?
Uh, not much, I'm afraid.
Magic.
The very dab.
That tickles.
It's like being inside a giant biscuit tin.
But without any biscuits.
I've lost my specs.
I cannae see a sausage.
Mum?
Mum!
Molly?
You're okay.
Oh, Molly.
What happened? Where are we?
Don't know, but there's no way out.
There's never no way out.
Where's Rocky?
I saw him back in that big room.
He saved us.
He did?
Come on. We can do it this time.
I can't hold this much longer.
Fetcher, quickly!
Find a ledge or a crack to grab hold of!
Righto.
Ooh! Not that crack.
Face the facts, duck.
We need a miracle to get out of here.
Hey! Anyone down there?
- Dad! - Rocky!
Do not tell him he's our miracle. There'll be no living with him.
Rocky is on the case.
No! Don't jump!
What? What's that?
I can't hear you! Wait. I'm comin' down!
Don't jump!
Oh! Family hug!
Oh, I missed you guys.
Okay. Well, let's blow this henhouse and head home.
That's the way out, isn't it?
I am so sorry.
Molly, what's wrong?
This is all my fault.
I should have listened to you and done what I was told.
Now everything is a mess.
Hey, where's my big, brave girl?
That girl's stupid.
You were right.
If we ever get home, I'll just stay there and never leave. Ever.
Hey, no. Molly.
This is my fault.
I should not have told you all of that ridiculous Lone Free Ranger stuff.
No, this is on me.
I used to hate being fenced in.
So why did I expect you to be any different?
I guess I was afraid you were so much like me.
What's wrong with being like you?
Nothing.
Because your mom is the best.
And she always has a plan.
Not this time.
He's here.
Are we ready to fry, Fry?
Five minutes, pumpkin.
- Make it four. - Oh.
Where is she?
Them runaway chickens, uh, have got themselves stuck in a corn silo.
In the silo, you say?
Excellent. I'll go and greet our guest.
Production starts in three minutes.
Three?
Looks like you've just run out of cluck, little chickens.
I think there's a grinder at the bottom of this thing.
On the plus side, though, we will all probably drown
before we're ground into tiny, wee pieces.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Popcorn.
Popcorn, everyone. Look. Look, popcorn.
Rocky, I don't think this is the time to...
The answer to all life's problems.
Of course.
Mac, we need heat.
- Lots of it. - Oh.
Will this work?
Perfect.
Now, does anyone have a match?
Yeah, you and a raving lunatic.
You'll blow us all to bits.
Besides, we've used the last one.
Oh no.
That's my girl.
Um, can I once again raise my health and safety concerns?
What is it?
All right.
Mm. That tastes nice.
Is there any more?
But guess what?
Just as Whizzbang Charlie thought we were back in Blighty,
enemy fire at six o'clock.
Ye gods. It's raining popcorn?
Good old British weather.
Unpredictable.
You never know what's coming.
Outrageous.
- Get in there! - We made it.
- Look. - Whoo-hoo!
Fowler's only gone and set up our escape route.
Well done, you old sausage.
Firm handshake will do, thank you.
Mission accomplished. Now let's fly this crazy coop, huh?
Oh yes.
Oh, look, Nick.
Have we got snacks for the way home?
All right. On you go.
Ginger, are you coming?
No, I'm not.
I'm going back.
For Frizzle?
For Frizzle and all the chickens.
Yes!
Just because where we live is cut off from the world doesn't mean we are too.
No chicken is an island.
We are with you, Ginger.
Aye, me too.
Me four.
The rats are in.
Right. What's the plan, Mum?
Oh, well, I didn't think you...
Rocky.
Hey, Molly, um, are you sure you're ready for this?
I was hatched ready, Dad.
She is a lot like me.
Dr. Fry!
What was that noise up on the roof?
Sounded like an explosion.
Looks like one of the silos has blown its top.
Maybe you shouldn't have put those chickens
through the grinder, my love.
Don't be ridiculous.
Melisha, all ready for the big day?
Oh yes, Reginald.
Everything is tickety-boo.
Jolly good. My truck is ready to go.
We've got to move fast.
While Tweedy is busy with her guest outside,
we sneak back in.
Molly, you take Bunty, Babs and Mac to where all the chickens are.
Come on.
- This way. - Ah.
Stay out of sight
and get ready to stop the chickens going up that staircase.
Rocky, we've got to get hold of that button.
And disable those collars.
As soon as the collars are off,
Molly's team leads the chickens out of there.
We bust our way out.
Steal the truck,
then we're home free.
Well, what are we waiting for?
- All right. Let's do this. - We're doing it today, are we?
So where was I? Ah, yes.
Whizzbang Charlie had lost his undercarriage,
and the old crate was catching fire...
Actually, Melisha, I have a little something for our big day.
Why, Reginald, this is all very sudden.
Ketchup?
Oh. No, no.
Something completely new.
I call it "the dip."
It's... sweet.
And sour.
Aren't we all, Reginald?
Dr. Fry?
Yes, my beloved?
Say those words I am longing to hear.
Get on with it, you idiot.
It's the funky chicken and the ginger one too.
Oh no, my wife will not be happy with this.
Come on here now, you naughty little chickens!
Oh dear.
See you on the flip side, egghead. You get it?
Dr. Fry? What's going on up there?
Quick. Come on.
Dr. Fry! Dr. Fry!
- Hello? - Dr. Fry!
- Anybody there? - Dr. Fry!
Dr. Fry!
Where are my nuggets?
Honestly, that man is about as much use as a headless...
Chicken!
Let's make some nuggets.
Oh no.
No. This is not good, Mac.
- Oh, Frizzle. Where are you? - Ooh!
My turn. Bye-bye.
Frizzle!
Lovely sunshine.
- No, wait. - Hold on to her.
Mac, hurry.
I got it. I got it.
I don't got it!
Rocky.
Go, Ginger!
♪ We're all goin' on a summer holiday ♪
♪ No more workin' for a week or two... ♪
Come on, everybody. We're goin' on holiday.
No, Babs.
They're going to turn everyone into nuggets.
♪ We're going Where the sun shines brightly... ♪
Not now, mate.
Please, Mac. Hurry.
Nearly done.
Just one more bit of jiggerypokery, and...
What happened? What's goin' on?
Frizzle, this isn't the best place ever.
You only get your own bucket
when they've chopped you up and cooked you.
And you came back for me?
Of course.
It's me and you, kidda. All the way.
Time to go!
Try to push them back!
- There's too many! - Ooh!
Is this one of the activities?
Mum!
Ginger!
Whoo!
Look. There's all the buckets!
The button!
That's it.
Frizzle, get on Bunty's shoulders.
What?
Trust me.
Up ya get.
Good goin', Molly.
Good job, Molly!
Molly?
I got this, Dad. Help Mum.
Molly, watch out.
What have we here?
- A little you. - Mum, catch.
They're going over, Mum!
Ginger, we can't hold them!
You can't wait, Mum. Do it now!
Sometimes...
you've just got to take a leap.
No!
- Cock-a-doodle-doo! - Huh?
No! No! No!
Ginger!
I got ya. I got ya.
Well, now.
I suppose you three might make a bucketful.
Bye-bye.
Again.
Come on.
Ugh. What's taking so long?
So much for fast food.
That's funny. Sounds like a...
...stampede!
- Get your skates on. - Move your tail feathers.
- Come on. - Come on!
You sure you know how this works?
Go, stop, and a spare one?
Come on! We have to go!
Full speed ahead!
Wrong way!
What gear are you in?
Oh, I call this "smart casual."
Ah, you there!
What kind of crazy henhouse is this?
Melisha?
Why are you dressed like a nugget?
There's the exit!
Get her off!
I think they're gonna need a bigger bucket.
- Chocks away! - Huh?
T.I. Fowler, Getaway Division.
Reporting for duty.
Where would we be without you, Fowler?
Darling! Darling!
The processor is dangerously overheating.
Pumpkin, watch out for the, uh...
- Oh blast! - What?
I think I left my umbrella in there.
Oh! The best thing about going on holiday is getting back home, isn't it?
Yes, it is. Isn't it, Babs?
- Oh! - All fixed.
Just had a screw loose.
Good to have a bucket or two handy in case you're feeling peckish.
Plenty for everyone.
This makes you happy and brainless, apparently.
Oh yeah, I feel it.
It's amazin'.
Mate, I haven't turned it on yet.
Well, it looks like we've finally got our happy ending.
Ah, let's just call this our happy beginning.
Sergeant Molly, reporting from reconnaissance.
Chicken farm, beyond the north field.
Thirty birds to a cage.
Poor little kiddas.
Right, everyone.
I don't like this one bit.
It's go time.
I've just got one question.
Is crowing back on the agenda?
Oh, definitely.
Ready, everyone?
- Ready! - Ready!
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
In the beginning, there was only the Primordial Mind.
From this mind sprang the whole of creation.
The stars, the planets, life and death.
But in time, the Mind was divided against itself.
Two fragments, the Radiant and the Dire, thought and action,
warred over creation with irreconcilable ferocity.
The Chaos of the Infinite followed.
Kings, queens.
Gods.
Monsters.
They all sought wisdom in the shattered Primordial Mind
and power from its ineffable madness.
But in his prison in Foulfell,
the demon Terrorblade gazed into the chaos
and found Truth.
Terrorblade found the idea.
Fuse thought and action.
Remake creation in his own infernal image.
Bram.
What the hell is he doing?
Why isn't he killing the damn thing?
Quiet. Watch the man work.
He's not coming out.
They always come out.
Crazy, stupid...
Here we go.
- Piece of shit! - Hey!
Dishonor my kill again, you're next.
Dishonor it?
Fucking thing killed four of mine, injured at least five more.
Gods! Another one!
Hatchling. Dead.
Hatchlings. Pups. Wee babies.
Bite your face off, boyo.
The entire nest...
it's gone.
They tore each other apart. It's like they all went crazy.
Like they all lost their minds and turned on one another, all at once.
Crazy wyrmlings, crazy hatchlings...
I'm sure it's fine.
This nest, it opens up.
Bram.
An eldwyrm dug this.
Asleep.
How do you know?
We're not dead.
Asleep, then.
Lovely.
Now is our chance. Now we kill the beast.
No. Now we pray he doesn't wake up.
And when, pray you, do we return to kill the big one?
"Kill the big one?"
Do you know how many living Dragon Knights
have ever seen a "big one" that still had fire in its guts?
Or whatever they have in their guts, it varies from dragon to dragon.
Bram.
One. That's how many.
Ah, you're afraid, then.
We'll ride for Dragon Hold in the morning.
Get advice, find help.
But tonight, I plan to celebrate the fact that I'm still breathing.
As should you.
You especially.
Coward.
All these people...
Just for you.
For that.
This morning they were terrified, tonight they feel safe.
All I'm doing is delivering their trophy.
- Davion! - Davion!
Oh, no. Not for you.
All right. It's a little bit for me.
Your father was a militian.
- Yes, sir. - He was a brave son of a bitch.
You look like you're a brave son of a bitch, too.
Like him.
Here. I want you to have this. Dragon fang.
I've got one just like it. See?
When you're of age, when you're ready, take yours to Dragon Hold.
They'll know what it means.
I'll slay monsters too someday. Just like father.
Just like father.
Davion leaped left, he leaped right.
Bobbing and weaving as the great beast lunged and snapped!
Finally, knowing it was beaten, the dragon fled under the earth!
Davion followed.
There, alone in the darkness, he slew the beast!
When we found him,
covered in the enemy's black, stinking blood,
he said, "Tonight, we dine! Tonight, we drink!
The village is saved!"
Of course, I played a critical role.
He'd have been dead a hundred times if I weren't there.
A hundred times?
A hundred times at least.
At least!
Worry not. I'll return with fresh cups for everyone.
- Barkeep, another round. - Excuse me.
I was waiting.
Forgive me. I'm in my cups. I didn't see you there.
Please, help the lady.
Thank you.
An Icewrack white, please.
Two glasses, chilled of course, not so sharp.
Two crowns.
It smells terrible. And it's warm.
It's beer. It's all we got.
Wet, sour and sharp enough to cut the head off a hellbear.
- Smells like mom. - But...
- Two crowns. - For this?
- I'll pay for her Icewrack white. - Oh, uh, in that case, they're free.
Wait. If I order, it's two crowns. If he orders, he pays nothing.
Well, yeah. He's Davion the fucking Dragon Knight
what killed a fucking dragon.
- This fucking dragon. - Among others.
Many, I'm sure.
But the one, the big one, you left down in that gods-empty hole!
- Don't talk much about him. - You're drunk.
Tell her all about it.
Tell her how you bravely ran away.
If all your stories were worth a steaming sod,
you'd be killing that thing.
Listen up, idiot.
One man alone can't kill an eldwyrm, nor 10, nor 20.
It would be stupid to try.
Waking that monster means death for everyone within miles of here.
Let the dragon sleep.
Now, if you'll sod right off, I was talking to the... lady.
Shit.
Ah! She thinks you're a coward, too.
Icewrack white.
It's supposed to be warm.
A human tavern.
Barely.
This isn't exactly neutral.
I assume you would've preferred a dark alley or the foothills.
The better to rob me.
Rob you?
Locating precious things for the wealthy is more lucrative than stealing from them.
My lotuses.
Selemene's lotuses. The usurper's lotuses.
I don't really care.
I care only to make them mine now.
I don't have your lotuses.
What I do have is a name. Travel to the Black Market in Haupstadt.
Ask for Nikdo. He'll arrange the rest.
You promised to bring them.
I promised to find them.
Now, the matter of my payment.
I'm not paying for a name.
Then I'll find Nikdo and tell him there's no bargain.
Safe travels, miss.
Wait.
I don't have money.
But I do have other items of value.
Oh, sorry. Not interested.
Human women are pleasantly soft, but too easy to come by.
That's not my offer.
This.
This bracelet. Your tiara.
I know who you are.
Ah! My future ex-wife.
And my other future ex-wife. Huh?
Never come down from the throne to address a peasant.
Oh, I see. Skinny bastard is your boyfriend.
Been stepping out on me, huh?
Snogging my future ex-wife, are we?
Believe me when I tell you, I would never dare tread
where you've set foot or anything else.
Ah! Insulting me now, huh?
Elf! Filthy spawn of tree rot.
Long-eared murderous animal.
Cousin of mine wandered into one of your enclaves once.
Came out half-mad, minus an arm and two balls.
Elves cut him a smile ear to ear.
Wait here.
He's holding me in reserve.
Think I'll cut you one to match it.
Enough talk.
I'll handle this animal myself.
This seems like the right place to drop the garbage.
Run.
Now, while you can.
Nikdo. In Haupstadt, Princess.
Princess?
You get more interesting by the minute.
Most men would've left him to the mob. Most men would've joined it.
I'm not most men. Barkeep!
Another round for all my friends!
"Princess."
I'm not afraid of any dragon!
Hear me! I'm not afraid of you!
Not afraid.
Not afraid?
I can still smell the piss on your leg.
Everyone knows.
Everyone laughs at you, Captain.
Shut up.
You're the joke of the village.
Sad and pathetic.
A coward.
Shut up!
Rage. Yes.
Oh, we can use that.
Yes, we can.
We can slay that beast. You and I.
And no one ever has to know your secret terror.
Your impotence. I'll do all the work.
All you have to do...
is let me in.
Did you want another go?
No. Not really. I, I just...
It's fine. I'm fine.
Sleep, lovely.
- You don't even know my name, do you? - Davion!
It's all right. I know yours.
- Davion. - Davion!
Davion, wake up!
Gods' mercy, Bram, I hear you.
- Come in. - Oh, finally!
Searched every room for you. I woke up half the...
Hey, ma'am.
It's Captain. He's gone to the foothills.
Moron. Brainless, arrogant...
He means to kill the eldwyrm.
I'm going after him. I'll try to stop him. One way or another.
- I'm coming with you. - You won't.
Go to Dragon Hold. The Fathers need to know.
They need to send everyone.
Always hated this part.
Oh, shit.
Hoping I show up in Dragon Hold with a head.
And both arms.
And they'll both be mine.
Eridu.
How?
Frahling.
Dragon Knight, we do the gods' work here.
You and I, we should be friends.
Friends? Frahling, what did you do?
No man is capable of... this.
Uldorak was old. Sick.
Yet even his powers at their height could not have saved him.
Not from me.
What in the Seven Hells?
Your voice. Your eyes...
Gods.
Tell me, Dragon Knight, Davion.
If you could do what has been done,
if you had the power, wouldn't you take it?
The little boy who stood frozen as his father burned alive.
I was just a child. How do you...?
Childhood evaporated with your father's flesh.
A boy made man by your despair.
Your rage. I know you.
I see you, trapped in your own hell of regret.
What wouldn't you do to escape?
- You know nothing. - I know this much.
Together, we can slay dragons.
Every dragon.
All you have to do is let me in.
You will release Uldorak's soul
so he may rejoin the Thunder and take new form.
Slyrak.
Father of Fire.
The Thunder speaks and chooses you to give it voice.
I'll collect your soul as I collected Uldorak's.
Uldorak was ready for death. The madness was upon him.
The weakness.
I am not so disadvantaged.
Run, little mouse.
Count yourself fortunate I have no taste for manflesh today.
Dragons.
No imagination.
All brute force.
No cunning.
No guile.
Weak.
Fuck.
I smell your fear.
Only my hate!
Brave little mouse.
The demon...
Fled to the hell he calls home.
Uldorak, his soul lost.
I couldn't just let him...
I...
You chose a side.
Sleep, dragon.
Die in peace.
I want nothing of peace, little mouse.
You know of the death I want.
You fought well.
You honor me.
As you honor me.
Forgive me, little mouse.
For all the suffering you will now endure.
Drunk and naked.
The best help I could offer is to let him sleep,
and when he wakes,
understand he must make better life choices.
It's not my responsibility to protect people from themselves,
no matter what good and noble qualities they might possess.
Don't look at me that way, Marci.
You can't possibly know he would come to my aid
if the tables were turned.
Which they never would be.
I should hardly need to tell you.
Fine.
Get him up, but put a cloak on him for decency's sake.
You will not be happy when you awaken, Davion the Dragon Knight.
But you'll live.
Not safe to walk this road after dark, friend.
Oh, you too good to talk to me?
Hey, you don't look too good.
Where do you think you're going?
You pass through here, you pay the tribute.
I'll have that sword.
Fuck off!
The sword's mine.
You will not be happy when you awaken, Davion the Dragon Knight.
But you'll live.
Sagan, no.
Don't worry, he wasn't going to eat you.
It's the blood.
My fang.
I had a necklace. Where is it?
My dragon fang necklace, did you see it?
You are as we found you.
Now please, cover yourself.
Wait. It's you.
Princess.
You're awake.
Now that you are, I have one question.
Whose blood is that?
Don't remember. I think it's mine.
Maybe not all of it.
Hmm. What happened to your clothes?
That's two questions.
- I don't see your little friend. - Hunting.
I'm sorry you lost your necklace. Was it a gift?
Not exactly.
What's the last thing you remember?
A burrow.
A cave.
A dragon.
The elder dragon you spoke of?
Eldwyrm. I remember two.
It's murky. It makes no sense.
Why would there be two?
I think they're dead.
So, you killed two of these eldwyrms. By yourself?
No. There was something else down there.
I'm sure of it.
What was that?
Dinner.
The only people I've ever seen shoot that well have points on their ears.
You know the Coriel'Tauvi?
I've met a few elves.
But you, your bow, the cat, you're from the Nightsilver Woods.
Not anymore.
And a princess.
Best you mind your own business.
At least give me a name.
So I can thank you for saving my life.
Come on now, you know mine.
And you've seen all my... secrets.
Mirana.
Mirana. You have my gratitude.
There it is. Haupstadt.
Sagan.
- Still feeling unwell? - I'm fine.
Must be something I ate.
Questioning Marci's cooking?
Wouldn't dream of it.
I know a tavern off the market square.
Innkeeper owes me a favor.
Don't think he serves any "Icewrack whites,"
but I can get us lodging.
- That's quite all right. - It's the least I can do.
Besides, as I recall "free" is about all you can afford.
Fine.
It will be nice to sleep in a real bed for a change.
It's gone downhill a bit.
Davion.
Is that you?
A bit more clothing than the last time I saw you.
- Hello, beautiful. - Buy me a drink, lover?
The road was long, and I need to get my friends settled.
Another night.
A night you'll never forget.
- And who was that charming woman? - No idea.
Nyctasha's knickers, it is you!
Raise your cups, you sorry bastards.
This is Davion the Dragon Knight, in the flesh.
Hear, hear!
- We need a room. - Two rooms.
And some clothes.
I seem to have misplaced mine.
Anything for you. Right this way.
Kaden.
One of the greatest Dragon Knights of all time.
I met him once when I was a squire at Dragon Hold.
Filled his cup.
Thought I showed "great promise."
How thrilling for you.
He's the only knight who's ever killed one of each of the eight types of dragons.
He's a legend.
How many types have you slain?
Five.
Well, you'll get there eventually.
My finest suite. Make yourselves comfortable.
We're not staying here.
Only cheaper one is out back.
But I suppose this will do.
Are you sure you should be drinking?
- You don't look well. - Hence the drinking.
Uh, get you ladies something? It's on the house.
Just directions.
We're looking for the Black Market.
What business do respectable ladies have in a place like that?
Private business.
I meant no offense.
It's on King's Way, uptown, right off the main square.
You can't miss it.
Allow me to escort you.
It's not safe in the city after dark.
You know how to impress a lady.
Was that in your stomach? How?
I don't know.
The fuck! Did you just heave up this ring?
This belonged to a friend of mine. A brother.
He was found on the road, torn to pieces, with five more of my brothers.
- You did this! - No.
They found dragon armor around the bodies.
- "Davion the Dragon Knight." - It's not possible!
Savage! Fucking cannibal!
Tomorrow. Midday.
My brothers and me, we're coming for you.
You're a dead man. You hear me? A dead man!
I smell your fear.
All you have to do is...
let me in.
You're awake.
How do you feel?
Like I went the wrong way through a dragon's asshole.
There's a right way?
Old family remedy. Drink it all.
Your lady friends went to the Black Market.
I told them to wait for you, but they were quite insistent.
I get the sense they can take care of themselves.
Um, I... I must ask you to leave.
Over a little blood and purge? This place has seen a lot worse.
It's just Deeb and his friends,
if they find you here, they'll burn the place down and kill me.
And besides that, they're good customers.
Say no more.
Listen, do you have a sword or something I can borrow?
You're not really gonna fight them.
Bare-handed, if I have to.
Not my preference.
You're a crazy bastard.
My name means something.
I don't run from beast or man.
Even if they are your customers.
Gods' luck, then.
You survive, I'll hang your portrait on the wall.
Not what I was expecting.
May I help you, madams?
Nikdo.
I was told to ask for him.
I see. I'm afraid weapons are not allowed inside.
If you'll follow me.
Master Nikdo will be with you presently.
I am Nikdo.
And you are?
Here for information.
I was told you might know the whereabouts of certain rare artifacts.
I know many things.
But such information comes at a price.
I am the most-favored of Selemene.
She will reward you handsomely if you help me.
I know that above all.
You?
We have a better offer than a few trinkets and empty promises.
May I introduce Mirana, once Princess of the Moon,
once Princess of the Sun, and now...
princess of nothing at all.
I locate precious things for wealthy people.
One of my clients happens to be from the Helio Imperium.
Your uncle. And he wants you so very badly.
I should have let those villagers kill you.
Probably.
The mute is yours.
Take them downstairs.
Got in a bit of trouble, I hear.
Nothing a good length of sharp steel can't solve.
What can I get for this?
You crazy? I'm not touching that.
Just melt it down. The gold's worth a hundred crowns, easy.
It's not worth me life.
Put it away and fuck off.
Look, I'm in a bit of a bind here.
Can you help me out?
You know who I am. You know I'm good for it.
I know who you are and who wants you dead,
and I don't like me odds on collecting that debt.
Sorry, Davion. Coin or nothing.
I have no way of getting any coin.
There's always the Narrows
if you got something to wager.
Fresh meat, eh?
Not bad.
This one's not for sale.
You can have the little one for 50 crowns.
Do what you like with her.
I'll give you 40.
This skinny bitch won't last a week upstairs.
Forty-five.
She's remarkably soft for a servant girl.
Uh... Deal.
Say goodbye to your servant, Princess.
Although I daresay your fate won't be any more pleasant.
Worry more about your own welfare.
Your men forgot to disarm me.
I'll break you in half.
I came here for information about my lotuses.
Tell me where to find them.
Or explain it to her.
The Shopkeeper. Talk to the Shopkeeper.
- Where? - The Magpie's Roost.
If any such merchandise moves through Candoness, he knows.
He knows.
And he'll know you, Princess of Nothing.
Outcast! Usurper's whore.
Finder of lost, precious things.
See if you can find your teeth. Let's go.
Place your bets! Throw the bones!
- Five on the pig! - Twenty on the boar.
- You're never gonna win, boy! - Five against.
- Five on the stand! - Ten against!
- Let's go! Let's go! - Roll it our way.
- Yes! - Dog!
You lose!
- Shit. - Make room for players with coin.
- Dead man. - I'm buying drinks tonight.
I was told you might be able to locate certain artifacts of unique interest.
This depends on the artifact and the interest.
Lotuses from the Temple of Mene.
I do not deal in stolen goods,
nor should a princess of the Nightsilver Woods,
exiled or not.
The lotuses were stolen. I intend to get them back.
Can you help me?
I cannot refuse an emissary of Selemene.
However, I'm afraid no one has offered them for sale.
But, perhaps a man I know can help you.
Who?
A sage.
He keeps to himself in his tower, in a valley south of the Broken Peaks.
You'll need this to see him.
Please.
I'd rather my favor be returned in kind someday, Princess,
who may be more than a princess.
Do we have a bargain?
Dragon Knight.
Princess. Find what you came for?
- I will. - I don't doubt it.
You look terrible.
I feel terrible.
You should rest, recover.
- Can't, I'm meeting some friends. - Those bandits.
In your condition, they'll kill you.
That is a distinct possibility.
You have no weapon. No allies.
There's no shame in walking away from a pointless fight.
We're going to the Broken Peaks. You should too.
Come with us.
I won't run from a fight. Even this one.
My name means something to me, to my brothers in Dragon Hold.
- Dishonoring myself dishonors them. - Stupid.
Brave but stupid.
Best of luck to you, Dragon Knight.
Sagan!
Komi!
Don't look at me that way.
What would you have me do?
I'm not what I once was.
Didn't you hear?
I'm the "Princess of Nothing."
That's the son of a bitch.
Is that right?
Are you the son of a bitch?
This doesn't have to get ugly.
Just apologize and we can go our separate ways in peace.
Only thing I'm sorry for is I can't kill you more than once.
- You have something of mine. - I'll have your head too.
Ah!
Not so fast, boys! Make it last!
Save me the ring...
Oh!
Come. Meet your death.
Marci?
Moon's sweet light.
Mercy!
Don't kill me! Please! I beg you!
I beg you!
I slay monsters!
Not people! I'm not this!
I'm not this! I can't be this!
Davion.
What have I done?
What am I?
You're coming with us.
Or take your chances with them.
You're headed for the Broken Peaks.
Yes. To see a sage who lives there.
That's on the way to Dragon Hold. We can travel together.
I'd understand if you said no.
I'm from the Nightsilver Woods.
Finding broken people,
putting them back together...
It's what we do.
We can travel together.
This sage of yours...
do you think he knows anything about dragons?
Fymryn.
You're hurt.
It's nothing.
I don't return empty-handed. See?
The Lotuses of Mene!
Hello?
Good morning. Is Albert there?
This is Al
Al, this is Bob
What are you doing?
Bob, I’m sleeping
What time is it?
It’s 8 am
It’s time to rise and shine
Huh, Oh no. I’ll be late for work
No, no, no. Today’s Saturday
...You don’t have to work today
Oh, Saturday.
...That’s right. No work today. How it’s good
Hey, are you free today?
Oh, today is Saturday.
...Yeah, I’m free
Would you like to do something together today?
Oh, That sounds good
...What do you want to do?
I don’t know

Translated by StudyPhim.vn
As commander in chief,I have determined
that it is in our vital national interest
to send an additional 30,000 US troopsto Afghanistan.
We have been at war now for eight years
at enormous cost in lives and resources.
This decision asks even more of you.
A military that, along with your families,
has already bornethe heaviest of all burdens.
Joey, come on!
It's already filled.
These are picturesof my dad's places in Afghanistan.
This is the first base that he was at.
I think he saidthat was his tent right there.
Um, there's him salutingone of his high-ranking officers.
There's his truck right there.
There, that's my dad, me and Joey.
I know, but Uncle Shawn,it moves side to side.
I can't really write like that.
My name is Joey...and I'm seven-and-a-half years old.
My brother is...
twelve-and-a-half, I think.
- Cheetahs, I can learn about cheetahs.- That's a good one. It's an animal.
My dad's in Afghanistantrying to make this country how it is.
Uncle Shawn,you know I'm not gonna eat it.
He saidif he's not doing this right now,
then we'll have bulletsflying over our heads at night.
My uncle saidhe'd take both of us for 14 months.
It was kind of hard to move'cause I had to get all new friends.
These guys are gonna come with usand then we'll meet you at the airport.
And then...
Uh, Isaac's right here,he's working on some stuff.
Isaac, it's your dad.
He's in Atlanta.
Hey, Dad.
Good.
Yeah.
My dad's coming back for two weeksfor a vacation.
When he walks through the gate,I'm gonna get up and sprint to him.
Joey, there's Dad's plane.There's Dad's plane right there. See it?
Yes!
I'm gonna see
if I can see my dad through the window.I know.
Look and see if you see himthrough the window.
I'm gonna see if...I'm just gonna wave in case he sees me.
Dad's coming off first.All right, come on!
Hold it up! Look cheerful.
Come on, Mr. Soldier Man.
- Is that him?- No, he's not that buff.
My dad's... Yeah, my dad's not that buff.
- He's here.- Can you hang on to this?
Yep, go.
I love you, guys. Hey.
Hey.
I love you, guys.Are you happy to see me?
- Huh?- Yeah.
What's that?
- I'm happy.- Good job.
You look the same, Dad.
Well, I hope so.
- Oh, wow. Dad?- I've only been gone six months.
I feel blocks.
Yeah, I've been working out!
- I feel blocks.- I feel blocks, too.
I feel blocks, too.
Love you.
- I love you, Dad.- I missed you.
I missed you, too.
I'm glad to be home.And I'm sorry if I smell, okay?
It's fine.You smell like a regular military guy.
Just like I learned. Just like I like.
- Just how I like it.- A regular military guy?
Hi, guys.
- Hi. Welcome home.- Hey, Uncle Ray!
You guys all right?
Yep.I'm singing my favorite song.
Joe Joe.
Joey.
Yeah?
Isaac, I think your braces look good.
What?
I think your braces look good.
Thank you.
I officially have butcher teeth!
You ever do anything to wreck those,you're in big trouble.
I won't.
When my dad was at Afghanistan,
I felt like I had, like,a 25-pound weight on my shoulders.
And then when my dad came back,it was like...
gone.
Hey, did you guys spray yet?
It's a lot easierbeing a platoon sergeant
than it is raising two boys by yourself.
When I got divorced,their mother chose other paths
and the court said,
'You're not gonna have custodyof your kids.'
So I've been doing it,you know, by myself.
She hasn't seen themin almost two and a half years.
I had a bite, though,he took half of it. Yeah. See?
Look at this.
He's not very big.
I question myself every dayif I'm doing the right thing for my kids.
You know, I'm trying to do my dutyto my country and deploy,
you know,and do what Uncle Sam asks me to do,
but you know,what's everybody asking my boys to do?
The Army is really greatand I really like that he's in it,
but it's just hard thinking like,
'Please, just, like,bring him back safe and...'
Just worrying about him.
And when I grow up, I don't knowif I want to follow in his footsteps.
Bye, Dad.
- Six months, okay?- Okay.
Once I'm back
we're gonna have all kinds of fun,alright?
- You gotta do it.- Okay.
As soon as I get on that plane,
the sooneryou're gonna stop crying, right?
- Really?- Come on. Be tough.
Hey, you know whyDad's doing this, okay?
- I gotta go. I'm gonna miss you.- Love you, Dad.
You guys gowith Grandma and Grandpa, okay?
Love you guys.
Keep your chin up.
Love you,Â Dad.
My dadÂ wanted one of his kidsin the military
and I was the last oneso it was kind of me by default.
I'm very glad I deployed
'cause I'm part of somethingbigger than myself.
You know what my biggest fear is?
Isaac says he's got a buddy at school,that his dad went to Iraq and he changed.
I don't want to be that dad.
I wanna be the same fun dad,you know, that...
We don't gethalf our security deposit back
because we shotall the Airsoft rounds in the house
'cause we had Airsoft fightsinside the house
or too many water fightsand it got on the walls.
That's the dad I want to be.I want to come home and have fun
and not, you know,scream and yell at my kids. So, yeah.
I think I saw onejust flying behind that tree over there.
Sometimes I tryto think about different things.
'Cause if I think about my dad, like...
it's hard to...
I'm sorry.
It's like hard to
kind of, like, hard to stay strong.
Oh, I think I got it!
Put the safety back on.
Yes!
My dad is, like,the only one that I, like...
practically love the most right now.
He said that he'll be all rightand don't worry about him.
'Just worry about you.'
I worry about my dad at night.
Because it's, like, darkand they can sneak.
And then they can go...
I miss the boys,and I know they're thinking about me.
Isaac says it on the phonewhen I call him.
'Dad, I saw the moon,same moon you saw nine hours before me'
and, you know, cheesy stuff like that.But, yeah, I miss him.
All IÂ rememberÂ is snap,snap, burn, chainsaw.
It might be a little tender.
Ow!
We were raidinga Taliban-held village
and an Afghan police officergot hit by a rocket-propelled grenade.
He was dying.
I don't care if people sayhe wasn't one of us or not.
He was on our side
and I'm going to get him.
I didn't go out there to get shot.
I went out thereto get that guy out of there.
It didn't work out that way.
My medic saved my life and his.
When you stand up...
Everything... that's the pins and needles.
And that's whyyou get lightheaded
because the vesselsthat keep the pressure,
your blood pressure normalized
and keep it pumpingthe way it's supposed to,
are not working.
In the long run,they were trying to tell me that
if it comes to a pointwhere you cannot run with your leg,
they can amputate.
You're not taking my leg!
No, that's my leg. It's mine. I got it.
Turn around the other way?
Can one of you guys come over hereand steer me? I can't get in.
Here you go.
It's weird.Â I haven't cried once.
It's kind of, like, not real.
Like, it was hard thinking
he actually got shot by a real bulletfrom a real gun from a real person.
And I'm like,
kinda messed me up a little.
All right, Daddy. Let's get you going.
It'sÂ a reliefthat he's not over there,
but gonna probably have a limpfor the rest of his life.
Like, every time I see him limping,it's gonna...
I'm probably gonna feel a little queasy.
Ouch!
'My dad
is a
American soldier.
My dad is a hero.
'My superhero.'
When my dad got shot,I just wanted to go to Afghanistan
and shoot the guys.
'Hey, you shot my dad. I kill you.'
Hold your breath. Hold still, please.
Once again,congratulations on a job very well done.
Dad, how do you sync songsto your iPad?
Hit sync?
- What?- Where? It doesn't show me.
It should be bottom-right.
Oh, crap!
Dad.
What, buddy?
It was dripping.
He won't slurp it.He won't... He won't do it.
Just drink the rest of it.
All this?
If you want to slurp it, go ahead.
You need to take a shower and get changedand your bus comes in 25 minutes.
Seriously, I can walk it.
I love you.
It's hard to explain, but like,I'm feeling really patriotic right now.
It's weird.
I feel a little more grown-up.
Like, I want to help a lot.
I can handle it.
Oh, you look great.
- What?- You look like a red-headed stepchild.
I'm tryingto get back to where I was.
You know, I got just over 17 years in
so I want to stay on active duty.
I don't want to say,'Okay, I'm wounded, I'm getting out.'
- Go.- Be a good partner!
I'm trying to put on the happy faceand the strong guy,
but you know, at the end of the day,you know, I'm almost in tears in pain.
It hurts.
Me and the boys, we love camping.We love fishing.
If I'm not able to dothe things we did before,
that's gonna hit me kind of hard.
So, I'm set on forward progress.
I gotta go.
All right, guys.
All right, man.
Love you.
The last few yearshave been a bit rough.
I don't really want to saythings fell apart,
but we didn't do as much togetherbecause he was limited.
I'm used to my dad beingsuper-active with us
and he can't really do that anymoreand I feel really bad for him.
Right when he left this morning,
I was kinda excitedthat he'd not have so much pain.
And I was a little scaredthat something would go wrong.
Just throbbing, back and forth.
For the past three years,I lived my life with a lot of pain,
lack of mobility, weight gain,
and not being ableto do stuff with my kids.
But now that's all gonna change.
- How's the pain right now?- It's not good,
and I don't like to whine, you know.
We called them.They're gonna come see you.
You mean...
Unfortunately, 'cause right nowyou're maxed out on what you can have
as far as the fentanyl goes.
Pardon my French, but it fucking hurts.
Feels like I just got my leg cut off.
I feelmy dad will get a lot better.
I feel he's gonna be a 60-year-old guythat still runs marathons.
So, I'm really proud of him.
Thank you for everything.
There, Stumpy.
What are you looking at?
Hey, lady,what are you looking at?
I gotta use rubbing compoundto get that off.
Joey,the side's a little bit sharp.
The doctor said within five weeks,I'll be in my first leg.
I'm moving forward. Let's go.
I just saw a four-pounderswim right by the boat.
I think all my self-worth
comes from physical stuff,like what I can and can't do physically.
I probably should've just got itamputated from the start,
but I had to try.
Right now, I still have two amazing boys
and I got Maria.
- What is it?- That's raspberry.
- It's two scoops of raspberry.- Isn't that good?
I was not at all lookingfor a relationship.
I didn't think I was readyfor a relationship.
I just wanted to, you know, to meet people
but I just think God had a different...
a different plan for me.
It was instant sparks. Instant sparks.
I mean, just, how could you not,just talking to him?
You do that?When you get mad at me,
you tighten up your jaw?
Hey.
Get your asses up.
Joey, get up.
It's a change.
We went from me and the two boysto her and her three kids.
But only one of her kids stays with us
'cause the other one's 18,living with his father
and 20, living on her own.
You're wearingthat to school today?
- Yes.- No, 'cause you slept in that!
Joey and Jordan are the same ageand they're completely two opposite kids,
but I think they're starting to learnhow to get along together.
Just don't hurt each other, guys.
That's what boys do.
- Wait! You can't...- No, your hand was right here
and it's on an awkward angle.
Oh, it's here. What's so funny?
I had shoes on that day!
Oh, yeah.
Joey tookÂ toÂ Maria so damn quick.
He took to her a lot quicker than I did.
I was like, 'Okay,we'll see how this goes.'
- If you fall, fall towards me.- Watch out.
Got it.
Learning curves, learning curves.
It's weird seeing my dad lopsided.
Start making a box.Now angle it.
- Angle it?- Angle it. Go across
from the corners. Yep.
Isaac really wants to help Dad.
He doesn't want to do stuff with me,
he wants to do stuff for me.
Joey, on the other hand,he loves doing stuff with Dad.
I think Joey is a lot more like mebecause he's just hardheaded.
But Isaac is out to make Dad proud of him.
It was awesome.You all right, buddy?
Okay.
Right.
Okay, so some of these pains I'm feelingwill desensitize over time?
Okay.
Okay.
Well, I appreciate it.
You kind of set my mindat ease a little bit.
Nice.
Okay. Thank you so much.
All right. Bye-bye.
I absolutely wishI was still in the Army.
You know, I had some power.
I had some authority. I had an identity.
And now,
uh, you know, who am I?
Why couldn't they rent youa go-kart or something?
Why? I don't need one.
Remember what I said,you go around and check out all the shops
and then at the endyou decide what you want to see.
There you go.
Joey.
That's cool.
One more. Do it again.
Isaac, if you wanna run aroundand have fun...
I know you're dedicated to Dadand everything,
but if you want to go have fun,you're more than welcome to.
- Thank you for serving.- Appreciate it.
Awesome. I retired out of Fort Drum.
- Fort Drum?- Yeah.
- Can I ask a question?- Yeah.
- Was it worth it? Losing your leg?- Oh, yeah.
I mean, this happened during a contact.
We got ambushed.
- So will you do a prosthetic eventually?- Yep, three weeks.
- Oh, cool.- I got to cut off a week and a half ago,
and I'm already in less pain than I was
with the leg after I got shot.
Prosthetics have come so far, man.
And it's right out of Syracuse.
Uh, excuse us. Thank you.
Thank you. Appreciate it.
Well, I feel likethey're feeling sorry for me.
Are we going to sit down?
No. Nope. It's your turn.
- It's my turn?- Yep, it's your turn. Go.
Go.
You can step up here if you wantto get some pictures next to her.
Yeah, I don't know.
Oh, my God, are you do...Are you all right? What are you doing?
I've been wantingto do this for a very long time.
Oh, my God! Right now?
Right now.
Oh, my God.
Will you be my wife?
Yes!
Do I look okay?
Stop talking.
Do another one.
- Do I look okay in all seriousness?- Yes.
My makeup's not running? Okay.
Come on, give me a kiss.
I hope I get a fish.I'm gonna squeal like a little girl.
- What?- I hope I get a fish.
Oh! What the hell?
- I got a bigger one.- No fair-sy.
Nice catch, babe.
That's three.
Nice.
- I got one! I got one!- You got one! Good!
I did it! Can I kiss him?
Bye, buddy.
Look at that sexy man right there.Good Lord.
I got your picture.
This is gonna sound weird,but I still worry about losing my dad.
That it's possible anything can happen.
It definitely makes memore emotional at times.
I'll be laying in bed.Everybody gets these feelings,
you'll be in bed,ready to sleep and think,
'Hey, let's think of the worst thingin life you can think of.'
It's like, 'Really, you want to make methink about that right now?'
So I just try not thinking about thingsmore than I should.
Any changes you feel likewith the wound?
- I'm getting mad.- You're getting mad?
Okay, why are you getting mad?
'Cause I...
Dried it out, you know, I've been doingeverything he says to do...
- Yeah.- And it just keeps doing the same crap.
Well, sometimes there's delayed healing.
Yeah, well,there's not delayed mental anguish.
Well, that's normal,so everybody goes through the same thing.
Yep. You still got an area there,don't you?
I don't know what else to do...
It's gotta heal. I mean, you're doingwhat you're supposed to be doing.
It's just gotta heal,that's the problem, so.
It's not good to jump the gun
and go into your prosthesiswithout a fully 100%-healed incision.
Awesome. I'll come back in March.
Oh, no. You're not that far awayfrom healing, sir. You're not.
I was told that a month ago.
I was told next week.Then the next week I was told next week.
How long
do I stay motivated?
'Cause this is four 'next weeks' in a row.
- Why would you...- We said...
You're not the onebanging into freakin' doorjambs every day
getting pissed offat the girlfriend and the kids.
I mean, I'm yelling at you.I'm yelling through you
'cause I don't even know you.
I'm getting pissed.
I think that you have set upsome unrealistic expectations.
I don't set unrealistic goals.
You think you can haveyour leg amputated and be 100% healed.
It's obvious you don't know me.
Joey, get them dishes done.
Just get it done so it's doneand then you can chill out.
This sucks.
Looking good, Joey.
I just swept this area.
How do you make this roomso messy so fast?
I don't knowif it's because he's just bored
because he can't move around.
I don't know if it's PTSD,
but when we're home,
ninety percent of the timeand he'll probably disagree with me
but 90% of the time
he's playing a stupid video game.
And he's not engagingwith us as a family.
All mismatched socks.
- I don't care.- Wait a minute. Hang on, here you go.
What do you mean you don't care? I care.
Put them together.If they're the same brand,
- just put them together.- Here, this one matches.
I do the laundry up in this house.Get out of my basket.
Get out of my basket.
Wait, one minute. I just got my...
Joey.
Out of my basket.
Sometimes I feel guiltybecause I'm not mission-capable anymore.
Like now I'm a burden
to the VA and to the militarybecause now they had to
treat me and take care of me
and now I'm, you know,collecting benefits.
I'm just a 'use-to-could.'
I can't do any of that stuff anymore
so I call it 'I-used-to-could'do that stuff.
Isaac, get done what you need to get doneand get the hell out of here.
Every time it's down to the wire.I'm not driving your ass to school.
Since the surgery and recovering,everything's stressful.
He's a lot more on edge lately.
Before he got shot,he wasn't really depressed.
But now I'm scared that he's...
gonna be sitting in a chairwhen he's 65, 70
just depressed.
Try and click. One click.
- And that's what you do?- That's all I do.
- Alright.- Good. Now let's have you do
a little bit of walking back and forth.
You're independent walking,you're independent with the stairs.
If, when you do that,
have both crutches.
Okay.
Not used to turning around yet.
This vehicle makes wide right turns.
I can't get my foot out.
Fuck you, snowblower.
Come on, Joey!
Stand up! Stand up! There you go.You gotta get the takedown.
Up! Up!
Not your back, Joey.
Peel and look away!Â Peel and look away!
Go, Joey.
Turn into it.
Turn towards me.
Turn towards...
You don't take that.
You go out there and wrestle smartand hard.
You gotta getsome aggression in your head.
This is not the big leagues right now.
Listen to me.
These kids are startingto take this seriously.
If you want to wrestle good,you gotta wrestle hard.
- Okay, you can't be out there...- I know.
- Pussyfooting and dancing around.- I know that.
My dad was a wrestler.
And now I am.
My dad was actuallyreally good at wrestling
and I think it was his senior year,he went, like, 26 wins and 3 losses.
But now he can't help me,like show me the moves.
Joey doesn't have enough ferocity.It's like, 'Get mad. It's okay.'
- Yeah.- Go out there, controlled chaos.
- Right.- You know?
I just don't get it. They just don't get..You know, they don't have that...
Right.
It's all I did since I was six.
It's just I can't get on the match.I'm too scared of my leg.
Yeah, you gotta go absolutely apeshiton that kid in the blue.
Wrestle hard. Stay off your back.
How bad do you want it, buddy?
Get off your back!
What is he doing?
Are you kidding me?
Why is he crying?
You got this, buddy.
Get mad!
Joey, stop crying.
I don't know why he's crying.I don't like that.
Go get changed. Are you okay?
Do you want to win? That's whyyou gotta put in the effort, alright?
Okay? I'm proud of you.
I wanna look at that kneeon the way home. Alright?
Let's go.
Sometimes when I sit in bed,I'll be thinking about
how good of a wrestler I could beif he didn't get shot.
Oh, there we go again,leaving all the shovels.
What is my...
pipe wrench doing out there?
I don't know.
You didn't use my pipe wrench?
I was breaking ice with it.
It goes back in the garage.
When are you guys gonna starttaking care of stuff?
We didn't drive 100 yards.My pipe wrench is out,
the snow shovels are still in the yard,
I got a glove blowing across the road.
- Start taking care of your crap.- I didn't know where it went.
I don't mean to soundlike a crybaby,
but I've been through a lot.
I mean, sacrificing yourselfto go fight a war for your country
is definitely a noble cause.
But at the same timeI'm not sure his injuries
for the rest of his lifewere worth it all.
When I get out of high school
I wanna go to collegeand then be a police officer.
When I was younger,I was always 100% military.
Let's go, let's go. Military.Put on a uniform and go overseas,
but when I actually thought about it,I'd like to be close to family.
I do want to have kids eventually
and I don't want my kidsto go through what I went through.
I'm pretty surethat they'd want a dad around more than...
anything else.
If there is a negative that's come out of this with the boys,
I don't see it.
Either I don't see itor I refuse to see it.
I got some mentally-strong boys.
That kid keeps staring at me. I might gopunch him in his left eye.
Why are you looking at me?
Wow.
Oops.
Oops.
I really like the military life
and that's kinda got meinto wanting to join the Army
'cause I love the Army life.
I probably won't even graduate,I'll probably join when I'm 17.
I want to run around,
shooting guns.
Doing fun stuff.
Seeing all the cool stuff. Like, I bet you
we'll be in a really cool warsomewhere else.
I'd feel okay with getting shotin the middle of a battle.
I bet you it wouldn't feel good
but I'd know I did something right.
I mean, it would scare mefor him to get hurt or even killed
in the line of duty overseas,
but if that's what he wants to go do
and fight, then so be it.
That's what he goes to do.
It's just losing familydoesn't seem very appealing to me.
Like that?
I see you.
Dang it.
I got him!
Every parentwants more for their kid.
The area we live inis not a rich community.
There's not a lot of good income jobs.
Even the nuclear plant's closing.
So, you know, there's even less jobs now.
Isaac wants togo to college for criminal justice
and he's gonna become a cop.I already know that's not gonna happen.
I don't mean to burst his bubble,
but he does not have the gradesto get into a college.
And when they send me a note home
that says,'Help your son with his homework,'
I have no idea
how to do the shitthey're doing in school these days.
No clue.
Where I really see Isaacand I hope he does it now,
I see him joining the Army.
I don't think any parent wantstheir kid to join the military
out of love.
But in the military, if you do your job,you're gonna get promoted.
So what did you guys do in school today,Joey and Jordan?
Me and Marshall were playing pickleball...
Marshall and I.
Dad, what day are you leaving?
For what?
- For wherever you have to go?- That morning.
Okay. Just checking to make sureyou weren't leaving before my birthday.
Do you know what the good thing isabout March 6th?
What?
Twelve months after that,if he's not enlisted in the Army
or enrolled in school, that's 400 a month.
- Does he know this?- He knows. What's the rule, Isaac?
When you turn 18, what's the rule?
Army or college.I'm going to college.
You better be enrolled.
I'm going.Everybody's doubting me.
I know I'm going to college.
That's a fact.
And he doesn't believe me.
I think I'll be signingsome recruitment papers
- in a year and a half.- I'm going to college.
- Wanna make a bet on that?- Yeah.
- You're gonna graduate college?- Handshake.
- I don't know.- Four hundred bucks.
Yep.
I agree,I don't know if you'll do it.
That pisses me off that you think that.
- Well, not...- It really does.
Not because I don't thinkyou're smart. I just don't think
that you'll go through with it.
No, I'm going through with it.
Part of mewanted to go to college too,
but I didn't have the grade point.
When I graduated,I was in the National Guard,
I was working at Walmart
and my dad said, 'You're not workingat Walmart for the rest of your life.'
So I went active duty.
Literally that fast.
We'd like to do the 6:30for American Sniper, please.
How old's the kids?
Sixteen, twelve, elevenand military.
So, five tickets altogetheris $42.50.
See that little truck there?I used to drive that. It was fun.
I'm alwaysgonna think about that day.
I think about, you know,
the guys in the platoon,how they're doing now, how they were then.
I don't know,it's like your mind races at night.
I'll figure it out.
My way.
You're gonna have to figure outhow to do this the best way, Brian. Um...
You gotta basicallypull down on here while
you work your way in there.
It's a little tricky, huh?You got it.
- I gotta learn somehow.- Yeah.
Is this something I can with?
- Yeah, you can do it.- Do you want me to pull on that?
He wants to do it himself.
Did you give me a dirty look?
- I gave you the stink eye.- Why?
'Cause I want to try this myself.
Well then,that's all you need to say.
Oh, my gosh, Brian. Look at you.
I don't even know how to run.I haven't done it in four years.
- That's okay. I'm so excited!- Yeah.
- Turn it to the side a bit.- Like that?
No, I like this.This is really comfortable, you did good.
- Good.- Yeah.
I'm gonna look funny running, I think,but I don't care as long as I can run.
Alright. Happy.
Love you.
- Brian!- It's slippery right there.
Brian. Oh, my gosh!
We just got to get to the concrete.
Gotta start somewhere.
Damn!There's snow on my new shoes.
Just make sure you stay off the roadwhen cars are coming, all right?
- Alright.- Let's do this.
You ready?
I don't know,I'll tell you in a minute.
I can actually stride.
You look good from back here.
Brian?
I start hitting and...
I start hitting,
it hits here
and I totally lose rhythm.
I'm hitting all over the fucking place, damn it.
Alright.
Going home.
I feel clumsy right now.
Wasn't what I wanted on my first run,that's for sure.
It's a big step for you.
I ran!
Winters got pretty boring I guess,
and you know,living way out in the country,
when it snowed, there's not a lot to do.
Opportunity came knocking at my door and Maria actually talked me into it.
I think she knows me better than I know me, but she's like,
'You need a hobby, you need something to do in the winter
and I think it's right up your alley.'
And I now own Tricky Phish Bait Company,so I make bass-fishing soft plastics.
Get 'em up.
The important things in life,I think now, family.
There's no holes. There's no rips.There's no tears. It's just strong.
I want my family to be happy and have everything they need.
Wow.
Ooh. I feel good.
Do I have to put on an undershirt?
I was gonna put a sock on this guy,but I don't think it matters.
Yes, you will wear an undershirt,
'cause you're gonna be sweating and it'll see-through on that shirt.
I've been married before
and I guess you don't know till you know.
'Cause when I got married the first time,I thought it was for the right reasons.
And then you get to this point and you're like,
'No, this is the right reason.
This is how it's supposed to be.'
I used to call Maria 'Maria,'
but now,I think I might be calling her 'Mom,'
after I realized she's here to stay.
Sorry.
I promise to be faithful to you and to love only you.
As long as you promise to love bass fishing
and the Green Bay Packers.
I promise that I will accept you as you are
even with all your flaws, and your faults.
There's many, but I love you.
Not only is this commitment to you,but it's to Isaac and Joey.
I plan on beinga permanent motherly figure to your boys
and to love them as much as I do Alanna, Brandon, and Jordan.
I, in accordance with the authority vestedin me by the laws of State of New York,
pronounce that you're husband and wife.
You ready for this?
- Heck yes.- You can kiss.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,would everyone please welcome
the new Mr. and Mrs. Eisch!
Yeah!
Welcome to the familyand hope you like your new last name.
You're not smashing this cake in my face...
- No! I'm not.- Promise?
As you can see up here,
we decided to make it all about our family.
My best man is also my first-born son.
Isaac... I'm sorry if I get sentimental.
Just forget you heard it.
You continue to impress me every day.
You've managed to fight through
some hard strugglesthat we've been through.
You've put up with my asshole-ness,
my stern ways,
and you're still growinginto quite the fine, young man.
Some days, I wonderwhat else you're gonna break,
because you've already brokenmy four-wheeler,
my lawnmower, my snowblower,
and you managedto back into Jason's brand-new Dodge Dart.
But I love you just the same.
We move on to Joey,
otherwise known as the stinky kid.
Joey is my hardheaded prodigy.
He's my youngest son.
He's the reason that my hair on my chinis starting to turn gray
and why I have high blood pressure.
I see qualities in you
that make me wanna stranglethe crap out of you sometimes
but I know later in life,
these qualities will make youa leader in the world someday.

Oh, Joey, honey!
Oh, my God, no!
Early this afternoon,12-year-old Joey Eisch,
was struck by a truckwhile he was riding his bicycle.
He was rushed to Upstate Hospital,but that's where he died.
Deputies are still investigatingexactly how this happened.
Caskets for the younger people,for five-foot, five-foot-six, four-foot.
They go in six-inch increments.
This would work good for you.
Yeah.
- He was so patriotic...- He's my splitting image.
And he was so 'American.'
- He wanted to be in the military like Dad.- He dreamed of joining the Army.
That was his goal, his dream.
He said,'I don't have to do good in school, Dad,
I'm joining the Army.'
I'm like, 'That's not true.'
So,we'll figure out what we're gonna do,
where the servicesare gonna take place, okay?
But we'll talk about thatin just a minute, okay?
We're gonna finish this part of itand then we'll get into the service part.
Okay.
So, Joey's gonna be survived by
his father, Brian...
I know.
Oh, Joey, my baby.
Fuck!
We are gathered here today
to celebrate the lifeof a beautiful child,
made in God's love and image,who was named Joseph Eisch,
born into this loving familyfor just a brief moment in time.
Joey, we love you.
Three, two, one...
Love you, Joey!
- Love you, buddy.- Peace out!
So from the pointwhere the flowers are,
three quarters way up the hillis where his body was found.
But the flowers are alreadywhere the bike first hit.
The bike hit here.
And his body was... right here.
I'm kinda numb right now.
With what happened with Joey,
I mean, I'm all cried outfrom the first night in the hospital.
I sat with him until his heart stopped.
I mean, now I don't evenreally try to hide it.
I just kinda zone out.
Isaac, you know, it's almost noon?
Yeah?
Alright, start thinking about waking up.You can help me.
I gotta finish that room today.
Joey's accident wasalmost three weeks ago tomorrow.
And I have this need,I don't know why, I don't understand it,
but I wanna paint every roomin this house,
like, I wanna make it different.
I don't think the familywill ever be back where it was.
I think we'll reach a...
a sense of normalcy, I guess,
but, you know,he's always gonna be in our heads.
This is probably gonna upset you.
Nothing really bothers me anymore'cause if something bad happens,
I'm gonna be with him sooner.
So I hope that doesn't offend you, but...
I think that's pretty selfish of you.
Okay.
Sorry.
You up?
Your bus comes in, like, 20 minutes.
I can see the bus route...
But you need to be out there.Just in case.
Yay! Senior year.
Smile.
It's your last first day of school ever!
Yeah. They just said that.
Love you.
Bye.
- Isaac, did you wash your hands?- Yeah.
- Did not.- I did. You wanna fight about it?
Not at school.I meant within the last three minutes.
It wasÂ definitely hard to havea father that did so much in his life,
for me to catch up to that.
I fully believethat ifÂ Joey was still here today,
you know, he'd bemy dad's successful story.
Okay.
Once you sign this,this is the job that you deserve.
This is the job that he wantsand this is the job that you will get.
Here. Sign your name.
- Just a signature?- Yep.
Just signed my life away.
Pretty much.
I was dead set on going to college
and now I'm dead seton enlisting in the military.
It felt like somethingJoey really wanted to do.
And it felt like something I needed to do.
Raise your right hand.
Repeat after me.
- I, state your full name...- I, Isaac James Eisch...
- do solemnly swear or affirm...- do solemnly swear...
- to support and defend...- to support and defend...
- the Constitution of the United States.- The Constitution of the United States
- against all enemies, foreign and domestic.- Against all enemies, foreign and domestic
- and that I'll obey the orders.- And that I'll obey the orders
- of the President of the United States.- Of the President of the United States
- and the officers appointed over me.- And the officers appointed over me.
- So help me God.- So help me God.
Congratulations.
I'm extremely proud of him.
From what I know,it's fourth generation straight
that's joined the Army.
Good job.
- Maria.- I'll take one of those.
- You said you weren't gonna cry. Stop it.- No. I'm not... I didn't cry.
You getting dressed here?
No. I'm wearing jeans and bootsand a T-shirt down to her house.
Putting the tux in the back seat.
What about dinner?
There's prime rib at the pr...At the dance
or whatever you call it.
- You eat there?- Yeah, prime rib,
that's why ticket's are $50 a piece.
- Well, that's freaking nice.- Right?
Do not lose these.
Oh, my God.You guys are just frickin' cute!
- Have fun.- Bye, guys.
Isaac James Eisch.
- Are you okay?- No.
I present to you,the class of 2016.
Why is everything done at the last fuckin' second?
What're you talking about?I have 'em right here.
This is a packing list! You packstuff up so you don't have to do it
ten minutes before somebody arrives.
Ten minutes left,and I'm gone for...
It should've been donefuckin' yesterday.
He told us half this stuff,we don't even need. That's why I'm...
Then they need to changethe fuckin' sheet.
'Cause the sheet says'minimum requirements.'
Where's the 'Future Soldier Bag'?
'All items must fitinto the Army Future Soldier Bag.'
So fuckin' difficult. Shit.
All the shit I bitched at you about...
fuckin' I hope some of it sinks in.
I'm not going to war.I'm going to learn how to do war.
I figured I'd say goodbye here...Remember what I told you,
you can cry all you want,the minute you pull out of that driveway,
shut it off.
Time to grow up. Okay?
You're doing it for you and Joeyand nobody else.
- Okay.- Got it?
Yep.
I'll give you one last...
Good luck.
- Good luck.- Love you guys.
Do the right thing.
- You all right?- Yeah. I'm proud of him.
He'll be all right.
He's still my son.
- Of course. He's your son...- Yeah, I know.
He's my first born, I'm, you know...
But it's not that I'm upset easily.
You know, I'm just...I don't know. Kinda...
'Cause he's out of the house.
I'm happy for him. Yeah.
He's in a whole new...
I mean, that's the goal.Your kids...
What, you want your kids to grow upto live with you for your whole life?
No. You raise 'emto successfully leave the nest.
And I think he hassuccessfully left the nest.
Successfully. Successfully.
Right?
Come on. Keep going.
You got this!Â You got this!
I don't know what I'm looking at.
Gestational sac is the small sac...
And the yolk sac is that other spot I see?
Yolk sac is a very translucent...This is the yolk sac right over here.
Oh, okay.
Is it still, like, too early to see,like, a heartbeat flickering right now?
I know you can't tell me, but...
- No, you can see it.- You can see it. Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
Yay!
- You happy?- Yeah.
I was worriedthere wasn't anything in there.
Baby Eisch.
Hey, Issac.How you doing? Oh, sorry, Private Eisch.
Mom and I have something to tell you.
Go ahead, Mom.
We got our results today.
Baby's perfectly healthy.
No Down's syndrome or Chromio...
- How do you say that...- Issues.
Issues. So, baby's perfectly healthy.
And we found out todaythat we are having...
- Jaxon.- A boy.
No girl.
You got another little brother coming.
Now do some damn push-ups.
- We love and miss you.- Hope you're doing good.
- Bye, honey.- Love you. Bye.
I'm gonna be honest,I don't know too much
about the war in Afghanistan directly.
I don't know what started the war in Afghanistan.
I don't know if Al-Qaeda is basedin Afghanistan.
I don't really followthat side of politics too much.
I don't really follow why wars happen.
All I know is, I love my country.
All right, so,
a couple things I want you to knowbefore we reunite you.
Your soldiers have went througha transformation process,
both physically and mentally.
I just wishmy little brother was here, that's all.
He's seeing you, buddy.
Now,are you ready to see your soldiers?
â™ª It's time to strap our boots on â™ª
â™ª This is a perfect day to die â™ª
â™ª Wipe the blood out of our eyes â™ª
â™ª We are the onesWho will never be broken â™ª
â™ª With our final breathWe will fight to the death â™ª
â™ª We are soldiers, we are soldiers â™ª
â™ª We are soldiers â™ª
And EasyÂ Company.
Have a great family day
and please carefully make your wayto see your soldiers.
Current worthy,strike strong and victory starts here.
Have a good day.
You can move your head, Davis.You can move your head.
We're at ease. We're at ease, remember?
My head probably ain't even moving.It's probably not gonna...
Eisch! Front and center!
Yes, Dad, you gotta come to me.
- That was like, awesome!- Right?
Oh, my God, Isaac, look at you!
- Is that how it's supposed to be?- It looks alright.
- I'm gonna get him one.- I like the one you picked out.
- That's the one I liked.- I like that one.
Do you wanna get a couple?
I like that.Â I think it's pretty.
- Do you want a bib?- I like these two.
Do you want...It's not even American, you can't.
Do you want the 'Drool Sergeant'?
- Yeah.- Bib? Yeah?
Correct spelling of your first,last, date of birth looks good?
- Yeah?- I have the perfect song
- for when he's born.- No.
- Just let me.- No. No.
Huh?
Hell, yeah.
- It's happening. I'm doing it.- No!
As soon as he's born,I'm playing it.
There you go.
Is that not perfect?
Hey.
Hey, Jaxon, it's Daddy.
Hey.
Hey, buddy. Can I FaceTime real quick?
- Say hi to your little brother.- He's adorable!
He is so cute.
I got to watch everything. It was awesome.
So, Jaxon, don't cry, buddy.
Get back to classand I'll send you some pictures.
I just wanted to show you, okay?
- Bye.- I love you, bud.
- I love you, too.- Okay.
He is so cute...
isn't he?
- Happy there?- Yeah.
Hi, Jaxon.
Look at his little squat little nose!
Welcome to the world.
I was a good boy.
You remember listening to me?
Cradle his head underneath your elbow.
And then you wannakinda roll him in there.
Right there.
Jaxon Joseph.
You know, he's got Joeyas his middle name.
He brought us out of a really dark place.
It's a gift, and I think it's Joey's wayof telling us it's okay to be happy.
I feelÂ likeÂ in the military,yes, it's a great career,
but it's not everythingthat it looked like
when I was knee-highto a grasshopper, you know.
I'll beÂ honest, I've been dealingwith a little bit of, uh...
little bit of depressionfor about a year now.
I don't know where it came from.
Maybe a result of my mother leaving.
Maybe a result of my dad getting shot,getting deployed, I don't know.
Joey, I don't know. It just hit.
It's hard to open up to my dadwhen he can't relate, you know.
He's just... He's betterat dealing with things I guess, than I am.
I thinkÂ weÂ still got a good bond,but...
I tell him all the time,'You don't have to call me every day.'
Well, now he doesn't call me every day
and I'm like, 'God,I wish Isaac would call me more.'
Fuck!
Hey, buddy! How was your day?
All right, let's get in the truck, okay?
Get in the truck?
Yeah.
Jax, do you think Mom's at home?
Yeah.
You wanna run in and see her?
Yeah? All right.
I thinkÂ one of the hard thingsabout being a boy is being tough enough.
I want my little banner-bannerto be a tough little shit.
And I do want him to serve.
Okay, come on.
Come on, let's go get Mom.
It's been what, five years nowsince I got amputated.
It's tough to seeother amputees running marathons
when not one lap around Walmartand Brian's gotta sit down,
'cause I just can't go on.
Don't letÂ BrianÂ fool you.He's not doing good.
He's angry.
He's angry about our son being dead.He's angry about being a 'used-to-could.'
He's pissed off that he can't walk around.
He doesn't feel manly,he doesn't feel masculine enough.
I don't know what to do for him.
The warÂ in Afghanistanhas been going on for 18 years now,
since 2001.
Well, about a year ago,
I saw some stuff on newsabout the town square I used to patrol.
Some bad guys hadtaken over that sector, whatever.
So that kinda hits you a little hard.
You know, what was the purpose of it?
You alwaysÂ think back,'Would you change something?'
Or 'Would you have done this different?'
It's over now. It's all stories.
Just keep going.
It's all you can do.
And fill your dayswith more happiness than sadness.
Good job.
- Eisch.- Morning, Sergeant.
Morning.
You forgot to shave.
That's off. That's off.
Boots look good.
I knowÂ my dad is proud of mefor joining the military,
but I do feel likeI'm letting him down sometimes
because I'm not living up to what he did.
I mean, I'm alreadytwo and a half years into career,
what do I have to show for it?
I'm just the bottom-of-the-line soldier.
But I do wanna go to war...someday.
This is what I was grown up to do.
There's nothing to tell. It's just some guy I work with.
Come on. You're going out with a guy.
There's gotta be something wrong with him.
So does he have a hump and a hair piece?
Wait. Does he eat chalk?
I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl. Oh.
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date.
It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.
Sounds like a date to me.
I'm back in high school, in the middle of the cafeteria...
...and I realize I'm totally naked.
- Oh, yeah. - I've had that dream.
Then I look down and I realize there is a phone...
...there.
- Instead of... - That's right!
MONICA: That one, I've never had. PHOEBE: No.
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
And it turns out it's my mother.
Which is very, very weird because she never calls me.
Hi.
This guy says "hello," I wanna kill myself.
Are you okay, sweetie?
I feel like someone grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth...
...and tied it around my neck. - Cookie?
Carol moved her stuff out today.
- Let me get you some coffee. - Thanks.
No. No, don't! Stop cleansing my aura.
Just leave my aura alone, okay?
I'll be fine. All right? Really. I hope she'll be very happy.
- No, you don't. - No, I don't.
To hell with her. She left me!
And you never knew she was a lesbian.
No! Okay?
Why does everyone keep fixating on that?
She didn't know. How should I know?
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.
Did I say that out loud?
All right, Ross. Look, you're feeling a lot of pain right now.
You're angry. You're hurting.
Can I tell you what the answer is?
Strip joints!
Come on, you're single. Have some hormones.
See, but I don't want to be single, okay?
I just wanna be married again.
And I just want a million dollars!
Rachel?
Oh, God, Monica! Hi! Thank God!
I went to your building and this guy with a hammer said...
...that you might be here, and you are.
- Can I get you some coffee? - Decaf.
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.
This is everybody. This is Chandler and Phoebe...
...and Joey. And remember my brother, Ross?
- Sure! - Hey.
- Hi. - Oh, God.
So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Oh, God! Well, it started about a half-hour before the wedding.
I was in this room with all the presents...
...and I was looking at this gravy boat.
This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.
When all of a sudden... Sweet 'N Low?
...I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry.
Then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me:
How much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head.
You know, I mean, I always knew he looked familiar, but...
Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering:
"Why am I doing this?" And "Who am I doing this for?"
Anyway, I just didn't know where to go, and I know you and I have drifted apart...
...but you're the only person I know in the city.
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Oh, I was kind of hoping that wouldn't be an issue.
I'm guessing he bought her the big pipe organ...
...and she's really not happy about it.
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him.
I'm sorry.
I just don't love him.
Well, it matters to me.
CHANDLER: She should not be wearing those pants.
I say push her down the stairs.
ALL: Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Come on, Daddy, listen to me!
It's like all of my life, everyone's always told me, "You're a shoe!
You're a shoe! You're a shoe! You're a shoe!"
Then today I stopped and said, "What if I don't wanna be a shoe?
What if I wanna be a purse? You know?
Or a hat?"
I don't want you to buy me a hat, I am a hat.
It's a metaphor, Daddy!
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Look, Daddy, it's my life.
Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
I guess we've established she's staying with Monica.
Well, maybe that's my decision.
Well, maybe I don't need your money.
Wait! Wait! I said maybe!
Okay. Just breathe, that's it.
Just try to think of nice, calm things.
[SINGING] Raindrops on roses And whiskers on kittens
Doorbells and sleigh bells And something with mittens
La la la something With string
I'm all better now.
I helped.
MONICA: Look, this is probably for the best, you know?
Independence. Taking control of your life.
And, hey, if you need anything, you can always come to Joey.
Me and Chandler live right across the hall. And he's away a lot.
Joey, stop hitting on her. It's her wedding day.
What? Like there's a rule or something?
Please don't do that again. It's a horrible sound.
PAUL: Uh, it's Paul. - Buzz him in.
- Who's Paul? - Paul, the wine guy, Paul?
Maybe.
Wait a minute. Your "not a real date" is with Paul, the wine guy?
- He finally asked you out? - Yes.
Ooh. This is a "Dear Diary" moment.
Rach, wait, I can cancel.
Please, no. Go, I'll be fine.
Ross, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
That'd be good.
- Really? - No, go on! It's Paul, the wine guy.
MONICA: Hi, come in. Paul, this is...
...everybody. Everybody, this is Paul.
JOEY: Paul, the wine guy.
- Wine guy. - I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
- Okay. Sit down. Two seconds. - Okay.
Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
So, Rachel, what are you up to tonight?
Well, I was supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon...
...so, nothing.
Right. You're not even getting your honeymoon.
God. No, no. Although, Aruba. Heh. This time of year? Eh.
Talk about your...
...big lizards.
Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight...
...Joey and Chandler are helping me with my furniture.
Yes, and we're very excited about it.
Actually, thanks, but I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.
- It's been a long day. - Oh, sure. Okay. Sure.
Hey, Pheebs, you wanna help?
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y thing to the side things...
...using a bunch of these little worm guys.
I have no bracket-y thing, I see no worm guys whatsoever...
...and I cannot feel my legs.
What's this?
I have no idea.
- Done with the bookcase. - All finished.
This was Carol's favorite beer.
She always drank it out of the can. I should have known.
Hey. Ross, let me ask you a question.
She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV.
What did you get?
You guys.
- Oh, God. Oh, my God. - You got screwed.
- Oh, my God. - I know, I know. I'm such an idiot.
I should've caught on when she went to the dentist four and five times a week.
I mean, how clean can teeth get?
My brother's going through that. He's such a mess.
How did you get through it?
He might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers.
- Say her... - Leg?
Heh. That's one way of going through it, yeah.
Me, I went for the watch.
- You actually broke her watch? - Mm.
Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.
You probably think it's about making love with your socks on, but it isn't.
It isn't, it's about me. And I...
Hi. Machine cut me off again. Anyway...
You know what's scary? What if there's only one woman for everybody?
I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it?
Unfortunately, in my case, there was only one woman for her.
What are you talking about? One woman.
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you.
Let me tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there.
There's rocky road and cookie dough and bing cherry vanilla.
You can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream.
This is the best thing that ever happened to you.
You got married. You were like, what, 8?
Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon.
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Then stay out of my freezer.
Ever since she walked out on me, I...
What? What?
You wanna spell it out with noodles?
No, it's more of a fifth date kind of revelation.
Oh, so there's gonna be a fifth date?
Isn't there?
Yeah, yeah. I think there is.
What were you gonna say?
Well... Er, uh...
Ever since she left me, um...
...I haven't been able to perform...
...sexually.
Oh, God! Oh, God! I am so...
- I'm so sorry. - It's okay.
Being spit on is probably not what you need right now.
How long?
Two years.
Wow!
I'm glad you smashed her watch.
So you still think you might want that fifth date?
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
I, Joanie, take you, Charles, as my lawful husband.
MINISTER: Do you take Joanie...? - Oh! See.
But Joanie loved Chachi. That's the difference.
"Grab a spoon."
Do you know long it's been since I grabbed a spoon?
Do the words, "Billy, don't be a hero," mean anything to you?
You know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough...
...to ask a woman out...
...who am I gonna ask?
Isn't this amazing?
I mean, I have never made coffee before in my life.
- That is amazing. - Congratulations.
While you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make a Western omelet or something...
Although, actually I'm really not that hungry this morning.
- Good morning. MONICA: Good morning.
- Morning. JOEY: Morning.
- Morning. JOEY: Morning, Paul.
- Hello, Paul. - Hi. Paul, is it?
MONICA: I had a really great time last night.
PAUL: Thank you. Thank you so much.
- We'll talk later, okay? - Yeah.
Thank you.
That wasn't a real date.
What the hell do you do on a real date?
- Shut up and put my table back. JOEY: Okay.
All right, kids, I gotta get to work.
If I don't input those numbers, it doesn't make much of a difference.
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Yeah, we all have jobs.
See, that's how we buy stuff.
Yeah, I'm an actor.
Wow. Would I have seen you in anything?
Oh, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
Unless you happened to catch the Wee One's production of Pinocchio.
"Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy."
I will not take this abuse.
You're right. I'm sorry.
[SINGING] Once I was a wooden boy A little wooden boy
MONICA: So how are you doing today? Did you sleep okay?
Did you talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
I know. He's just so...
Remember you and Tony De Marco?
- Oh, yeah. - Well, it's like that. With feelings.
Oh, wow, are you in trouble!
Okay, okay. I am just going to get up, go to work...
...and not think about him all day.
Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
- Oh, wish me luck! - What for?
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
- Hey, Monica. - Hey, Franny. Welcome back.
How was Florida?
You had sex, didn't you?
How do you do that?
- So, who? - You know Paul?
Paul, the wine guy?
Oh, yeah, I know Paul.
You mean, you know Paul like I know Paul?
Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul.
Before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
Of course it was a line.
Why? Why would anybody do something like that?
We're looking for an answer more sophisticated than:
"To get you into bed."
Is it me?
Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs...
...and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
All right, come here. Give me your feet.
I just thought he was nice, you know?
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line.
Guess what.
- You got a job? - Are you kidding?
I'm trained for nothing.
I was laughed out of 12 interviews today.
Yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
Well, you would be too if you found Joan and David boots on sale...
...50 percent off.
Oh, how well you know me.
They're my new "I don't need a job or my parents.
I've got great boots" boots.
- How'd you pay for them? - Uh, credit card.
And who pays for that?
Um, my father.
You can't live off your parents your whole life.
I know that. That's why I was getting married.
Give her a break. It's hard being on your own for the first time.
- Thank you. - You're welcome.
I remember when I first came to this city, I was 14.
My mom had killed herself and my stepdad was back in prison.
And I got here, and I didn't know anybody.
I ended up living with this albino guy who was cleaning windshields...
...outside Port Authority. And then he killed himself.
And then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
The word you're looking for is:
"Anyway..."
All right. You ready?
- I don't think so. ROSS: Oh, come on.
Cut. Cut.
ALL: Cut, cut, cut.
ROSS: Hey. MONICA: All right.
Welcome to the real world.
It sucks. You're gonna love it.
Well, that's it. You gonna crash on the couch?
- No. No, I gotta go home sometime. - Are you gonna be okay?
Yeah.
Look what I just found on the floor.
What?
That's Paul's watch.
You can just put it back where you found it.
Oh, boy. All right. Good night, everybody.
ROSS & RACHEL: Good night.
- Oh, sorry. - No. Oh, no. Go.
- No, have it, really. - Split it?
- Okay. - Okay.
Thanks.
You probably didn't know this, but back in high school I had...
...a major crush on you.
I knew.
You did? Oh.
I figured you thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
- I did. - Oh.
Listen, do you think...
And try not to let my vulnerability become any kind of a factor here.
Do you think it would be okay if I ask you out sometime, maybe?
Yeah.
Maybe.
Okay.
Okay, maybe I will.
- Good night. - Good night.
See you.
Wait, wait. Hey, what's with you?
I just grabbed a spoon.
Can't believe what I'm hearing.
[SINGING] I can't believe What I'm hearing here
- What? I said you had... - What? I said you had...
- Would you stop? - Oh, was I doing it again?
ALL: Yes.
WOMAN: Would anybody like more coffee?
Did you make it or are you just serving it?
- I'm just serving it. CHANDLER: I'll have a cup of coffee.
Kids, new dream.
I'm in Las Vegas. I'm Liza Minnelli.
What you guys don't understand is...
...for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
Yeah, right.
You serious?
Oh, yeah.
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
- Absolutely. - Yeah, I think, for us...
...kissing is pretty much like an opening act.
I mean, it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through...
...before Pink Floyd comes out.
Yeah, and it's not that we don't like the comedian.
It's just that that's not...
...why we bought the ticket.
See, the problem is, though...
...after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was...
...you girls are always looking for the comedian again.
I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic...
...basically just trying to stay awake.
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian.
Otherwise, you're gonna find yourself...
...sitting at home listening to that album alone.
Are we still talking about sex?
ROSS: No, it's good. It is good.
It's just that, doesn't she seem a little angry?
Well, she has issues.
Does she?
He's out banging other women over the head with a club...
...while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet.
Marsha, see, these are cave people.
Okay, they have issues like:
"Gee, that glacier's getting kind of close." See?
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
- No, no. - Yes, it is. Carol, hi.
ROSS: Okay. Yes. Yes, it is.
How about I'll catch up with you in the Ice Age?
- Hi. - Hi.
So...
You look great.
I hate that.
Sorry. Thanks. You look good too.
Well, you know, in here, anyone who...
...stands erect...
- So, what's new? Still a... - A lesbian?
Well...
You never know.
How's, um...? How's the family?
Marty's still totally paranoid.
- Oh, and... - Carol, why are you here, Carol?
- I'm pregnant. - Pregnant.
Oh. Looks like she didn't leave in such a hurry after all.
I think this is the episode of Three's Company...
...where's there's some kind of misunderstanding.
Then I've already seen this one.
Are you through with that? Thanks.
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
Whose little ball of paper is this?
Oh, that would be mine.
See, I wrote a note to myself, then I didn't need it.
So I balled it up and now I wish I was dead.
She already fluffed that pillow. Monica, you know, you already fluffed...
But it's fine.
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't want to give them any more ammunition than they have.
Yes, we know how cruel a parent can be...
...about the flatness of a child's pillow.
Monica? Hi. Um...
Monica, um, you're scaring me.
I mean, you're, like, all chaotic and twirly, you know?
Not in a good way.
Yeah, calm down.
You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
That's because, as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong.
You see, he's the prince.
Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
- What? - Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.
- Has anybody seen my engagement ring? - Yeah, it's beautiful.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God. - No, don't touch that.
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough having to give it back to him.
"Hi, Barry, remember me? I'm the girl...
...that stomped on your heart in front of your entire family"
Oh, God. Now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring...
...which makes it so much harder.
Easy, Rach, we'll find it. Won't we?
- Oh, yeah. MONICA: Okay, look.
When did you have it on last?
Doy. Probably right before she lost it.
You don't get a lot of "doy" these days.
I know I had it this morning.
I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
Dinah?
Oh, don't be mad.
- You didn't. - Oh, I'm sorry.
I gave you one job.
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are.
Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagna.
I just can't do it.
Boys?
We're going in.
Hi.
Oh, that is not a happy "hi."
Carol's pregnant.
Oh, I found it.
Well, what...? What?
Yeah.
Do that for another two hours...
...you might be where I am right about now.
Kind of puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
Well, now, how do you fit into this whole thing?
Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved.
But if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.
Basically, it's totally up to me.
She is so great. I miss her.
What does she mean by "involved"?
I mean, presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
Anyway, they want me to go down to this...
...sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
So, what are you gonna do?
I have no idea.
No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
Well, this is still ruined, right?
Oh. Martha Lugwin's daughter is gonna call you.
Mm. What's that curry taste?
Curry.
I think they're great. I really do.
You remember the Lugwins?
The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?
They all had a thing for him.
Oh, Mom.
I'm sorry. Why is this girl going to call me?
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking or food...
...or I don't know.
Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant, so...
No, Mom. I don't have a restaurant. I work in a restaurant.
Well, they don't have to know that.
Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti.
Yes.
Oh, we're having spaghetti. That's...
...easy.
I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish on my part...
...but were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing?
Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
What that Rachel did to her life. We ran into her parents at the club.
They were not playing very well.
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding...
...but $40,000 is a lot of money.
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar.
- What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing.
- It's an expression. - No, it's not.
Don't listen to your mother.
You're independent and you always have been.
Even when you were a kid, and you were chubby...
...and you had no friends, you were just fine.
You'd read alone in your room. And your puzzles...
Look, there are people, like Ross, who need to shoot for the stars.
With his museum and his papers getting published.
Other people are satisfied with staying where they are.
I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God...
...our little Harmonica doesn't seem to have that problem.
So, Ross, what's going on with you?
Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
Okay, okay.
Ahem. Look, I, uh... I realize you guys have been wondering...
...what exactly happened between Carol and me.
And so, well, here's the deal.
Carol's a lesbian.
She's living with a woman named Susan.
She's pregnant with my child.
And she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
And you knew about this?
Your folks are really that bad, huh?
Well, you know, these people are pros.
They know what they're doing. They take their time.
They get the job done.
Boy, I know they say that you can't change your parents.
Boy, if you could, I'd want yours.
Must pee.
You know, it's even worse when you're twins.
- You're a twin? - Oh, yeah. We don't speak.
She's like this high-powered, driven, career-type.
- What does she do? - She's a waitress.
All right. You guys, I kind of gotta clean up now.
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend...
...who my parents actually preferred.
RACHEL: Hit the lights, please.
How long was I in there?
I'm just cleaning up.
Oh, do you, uh...? Do you need any help?
Um, okay, sure. Thanks.
Anyway...
So you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
- Oh, a little. - Mm-hm.
- A lot. - Mm-hm.
So got any advice?
You know, as someone who's recently been dumped.
Well, you may want to steer clear of the word "dumped."
Chances are he's going to be this broken shell of a man. You know?
So you should try not to look too terrific. I know it'll be hard.
Or, you know, hey, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring.
And you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB-GYN.
You've got Carol tomorrow.
When did it get so complicated?
Got me.
- Remember when we were in high school? - Yeah.
I mean, didn't you think you' were gonna meet someone...
...fall in love, and that'd be it?
- Ross? - Yes, yes.
Oh. Man. I never thought I'd be here.
Me neither.
Hi. Sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work.
There was this big dinosaur thing. Anyway...
Hi.
- Ross, you remember Susan. - How could I forget?
Ross.
Hello, Susan. Good shake, good shake.
So, uh, we're just waiting for?
- Dr. Oberman. - Dr. Oberman. Okay, and is he...?
- She. - Of course, "she."
She, uh, familiar with our special situation?
Yes, and she's very supportive.
Great. Okay, that's great. Heh.
No, I'm...
CAROL: Thanks.
Ross?
That opens my cervix.
- Barry? BARRY: Come on in.
Are you sure?
BARRY: It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
So how are you doing?
I'm...
I'm okay.
You look great.
Yeah, well...
RECEPTIONIST [OVER SPEAKER]: Dr. Farber, Jason Greenspan's gagging.
Be right there. I'll be back in a second.
I dumped him.
Okay.
- Ross. - So, um...? So how's this going to work...
...ahem, you know, with us?
You know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?
Give me a "for instance."
Well, I don't know. Okay, okay.
- How about with the baby's name? - Marlon...
- Marlon. ...if it's a boy. Minnie, if it's a girl.
As in "Mouse"?
As in my grandmother.
Still, you say "Minnie," you hear "Mouse."
How about, um...
How about "Julia"?
Julia.
We agreed on Minnie.
It's funny, um, we agreed we'd spend our lives together.
Things change. Roll with the punches.
I believe Julia's on the table.
Oh. Sorry about that.
So, what have you been up to?
Oh. Not much.
- I got a job. - Hey, that's great.
Why are you so tan?
I went to Aruba.
Oh, no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
No.
See, uh, I went with...
- Now, this may hurt. - Me?
No.
I went with Mindy.
Mindy?
My maid of honor, Mindy?
Yeah, well, we're kind of a thing now.
Well, I'm...
You got plugs.
Careful, careful. They haven't quite taken yet.
And you got lenses.
But you hate sticking your finger in your eye.
Not for her.
Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
Okay.
About a month ago, I wanted to hurt you...
...more than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life.
And I'm an orthodontist.
You know, you were right. I mean, I thought we were happy.
We weren't happy.
But with Mindy...
...now I'm happy.
- Spit. - What?
Me.
Anyway, um...
I guess, uh... I guess this belongs to you.
And thank you for giving it to me.
Well, thank you for giving it back.
Hello.
Oh, please. What's wrong with Helen?
Helen Geller?
- I don't think so. - Hello, it's not gonna be Helen Geller.
Thank you.
No. I mean, it's not Geller.
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick Bunch.
Well, wait a minute. Why is she in the title?
Because it's my baby too.
That's funny. Really? I don't remember you making any sperm.
And we all know what a challenge that is.
- Uh-huh. See? - All right, you two, stop it.
No, no. She gets a credit. Hey, I'm in there too.
Honestly. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick Bunch Geller.
I think that borders on child abuse.
Of course not. I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.
Oh, no. No, no, no. You see what he's doing?
He knows no one is gonna say all those names.
He knows they'll wind up calling her Geller. Then he gets his way.
My way? You think this is my way?
Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being...
...this is not my way. You know what? This is too hard.
Knock, knock. How are we today? Any nausea?
- A little. - Just a little.
Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but, uh, thanks for sharing.
Uh, lie back.
You know what? I'm gonna go.
Um, I don't think I can be involved in this particular family thing.
Oh, my God.
Look at that.
I know.
Well, isn't that amazing?
What are we supposed to be seeing here?
I don't know, but I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
You know, if you tilt your head to the left and relax your eyes...
...it kind of looks like an old potato.
Then don't do that, all right?
Monica?
What do you think?
Mm-hm.
Are you welling up?
- No. - You are.
- You are. You're welling up. - No, I'm not.
- You're gonna be an aunt. - Oh, shut up.
Hi, Mindy.
Hi, it's Rachel.
Yeah, I'm fine. I saw Barry today.
Oh, yeah, yeah, he told me.
No, it's okay. Really, it's okay.
I hope you two are very happy. I really do.
And, Min, you know, if everything works out...
...and you guys end up getting married and having kids and everything...
...I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose.
Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
Nice view.
Oh, it is.
You know this is number 37.
Number 37?
Yeah.
It's our 37th beach we've visited since our retirement.
You're counting?
- Yeah. Well, you know-- - Oh, my God.
Take a girl out of the FBI, but you know,
I'm a little OCD.
I can't help it.
- You are, and you know what? - Are we sure? What?
You know what?
I think-- I think this 37th beach
is my favorite--
Mm.
Because it feels like you and me are the only people
in the world.
Oh, yeah. I love it.
What are you guys talking about?
And then there's my brother.
Mm-hmm.
- We're talking about you. - Me?
How good you are.
And how much we love you.
- Hey. - Aw, I love you guys.
Hey, who's this?
Can we get this party started?
- Yeah! - Yeah!
I haven't had a drink all day.
The gang's all here.
Let's go. Let's get it.
Okay, pastor.
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today to commemorate
the union of two people near and dear to us,
our sister, Link, and George Caras.
And I gotta admit, Caras, I ain't like your ass at first.
Yeah. Yeah.
I was a little uptight.
A little uptight?
You were a fucking brick, homie, straight up.
Yeah.
And then you loosened up. You grew a beard.
You know what?
Let me tell you something.
You made Link happy, finally.
And we're all good.
Let's just keep going.
Look at her. She's glowing.
- She's glowing. - Glowing!
Thank you, guys.
You break her heart, I break your neck.
Come on. Let's keep goin'.
Let's keep goin'.
Hold on. I'm runnin' this show.
I got ordained online and everything for this shit.
Excuse me, Lord.
Do you, Caras, take this beautiful woman, Link,
to be your lawfully wedded wife,
to love and to hold through the good times and the bad,
till death do your part?
I do.
And do you, Link, take this man--
All right, come on, come here, come here.
Oh, my God!
Tell you right now,
anybody was on that boat they're barbecue.
I know. I know.
But what if this were a distraction?
You mean like when we blew up that limo in Ibiza?
Oh, shit! There's two of them.
Fuck!
They got guns, man. Let's go! Let's go!
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Don't fight them! They'll kill you!
They got the drop on us, guys.
Hell no, man!
Target has been captured.
Copy that.
Sniper one heading back to base.
Mason, wait.
Where-- where you headed?
Not a good time, Shawn.
Wait, Mason, don't hang up!
Looks like we have a tail.
Copy that.
Backup on route. Sniper one on the way.
Sniper two, we have eyes on target.
Eyes on target.
Copy that. Take the shot.
Take the shot.
What is it?
It's gone!
I-- it's-- it's gone?
What's gone?
I mean, it's fucking gone!
Not just the dirt box, my entire server has been wiped.
You have a backup to this?
Of course. I have redundancy.
But that server's been wiped, too.
But you said it was impossible for this to be hacked.
So how could that be?
It-- it was.
Well, how did it happen?
I don't know, Mason! I don't know!
Hey, sweetie.
It's not your fault, okay?
- Yes, it is. - No.
- My fault. - No, no, no, no, no.
He's right. It's not your fault.
Something else is-- something else is goin' on.
So-- so what's gonna happen?
I mean, isn't the dirt box the only thing keepin' us alive?
If Salazar has that copy,
I'm tellin' you he'll kill all of us.
Whatever happen, we gotta stick together.
If I go down, I'm gonna go down protecting y'all.
Nobody's goin' down.
uh, they-- they want something from us.
They want something from us.
Otherwise, we'd all be dead.
Think about the beach.
They would've killed us if they didn't want something.
If he has the dirt box,
what do we have that Salazar could want?
We have the know-how, man.
We've proven it.
How many times have we pulled this kind of thing off?
We got the team.
We got Hector and Anton.
They're the best crowd control.
We've got Link who knows more than fucking Steve Jobs
and Elon Musk put together.
You-- you, Shawn, you--
I've never known a safe that you haven't been able to bust.
And Caras, we have you now on our team, not theirs.
That's big, man.
I know finance.
I know more about Abel Salazar than I care to.
And we're gonna use that. We're gonna need that.
Okay.
So, what are we talkin' about, Mason?
Abel Salazar wants us to do a job.
That simple.
A job?
He wants our team.
That's what he wants.
And you know what?
Here it is.
Hello?
Hello, Mason.
Who is this?
We met in Seattle.
Let me guess. This is Flowers.
And Salazar wants us to do a job for him.
Is that right?
Very astute.
And payment for successful completion of the assignment
will be the safe return of Amelia Decker.
Why don't you just return Amy right now?
She's-- she's great at logistics.
She could help us.
And give up our leverage?
Come on, leverage.
Salazar could kill us anytime, anywhere.
You know that.
She-- he-- he-- he doesn't need to use Decker's leverage.
This is not a negotiation.
Complete the job, get Decker back.
Okay, what is the job? What are we doing?
You're on a need-to-know basis, Mason.
Your team will be picked up in one hour from your hotel.
And-- and where are we going?
As I said, you are always on a need-to-know.
You know what?
This conversation ends right now unless you put Amy on the phone.
Put Amy on the phone!
Certainly.
We're not barbarians.
For you.
Thank you.
Well, here we are again.
Separated and on the phone.
Yeah, I know.
But last time you, uh, you were working for the FBI
and-- and, uh, you betrayed me.
Yeah.
Look how that worked out.
Pretty good, I think.
Oh, please tell me that you're okay.
It's not the first time I've been tased.
You should see the other guy.
I'd put a little ice on that if I were you.
I'm so sorry, Amy.
I let my guard down.
Mason, don't do that.
It's not your fault.
If they didn't get me there,
they would have gotten me somewhere else.
What Abel Salazar wants, he gets.
I promise you I'll get you back.
I know you will.
Looks like we're takin' off.
Tak-- you on a plane?
Amy, are you on a plane?
Amy?
Fuck!
Hey, how you doing?
I'm Agent Richter.
Looking for a few people
that might have checked into this hotel.
Does this look familiar to you?
- Like this guy over here. - No.
Move, move!
They're there! Come on!
Lock it down!
Hey, Link, you gotta move out now.
The feds are back. Call Flowers.
Hey guys, got room for one more?
- Bro, take the next. - Man, I gotta get to a meeting.
Get on the fuckin' next one.
Rude.
Let's go.
Hold that elevator!
Stop!
Are you sure this the only way down?
Uh.
We got 12 feet of water, man.
You want us to jump?
- Just skim. Just skim. - Are you sure about this, man?
We're running out of time, guys.
They're almost here.
- Come on, man. They're comin'. - Shit!
Jump! Come on!
- You got this. - No!
Oh, fuck.
Let's go.
Oh, my God.
Come on.
Oh, I can't believe I did that still.
Link and Caras in there?
They're inside! Get in!
Never been to Louisiana.
Least I get to cross another state off my list.
You are the ultimate optimist, Shawn.
I think that's your superpower.
I really do.
The Scarlet Pearl International Hotel and Casino.
A decadent playground for the rich and famous.
Huh, oh, this is a casino gig?
I'm all ears.
This is the owner of the whole enterprise.
Zade Black.
He made a name for himself in the shrimping industry.
One of his processing plants is behind the hotel.
Now he has his hands in all kinds of illicit activities.
He uses the casino and his shrimp empire
to launder money.
By all accounts, he is very charming
and also an extremely dangerous sociopath.
Kind of sounds like your boss.
So what's the score?
The top floor of the hotel...
...is Black's personal penthouse suite.
Inside the penthouse is a safe.
You must find a way to access it.
What's in the safe?
You'll be told when the time is right.
What kind of safe are we talking about?
I don't know.
Okay, well, do you know where it might be in the suite?
I'm not here to do your job.
You have to find it.
There are only two access points
via a private elevator and the emergency exit.
There are armed guards in the suite at all times.
Moreover, every inch is monitored 24/7
by security cameras.
What kind of cameras?
He doesn't know, Link,
because apparently the Salazar group
isn't as all-knowing as they pretend to be.
- Oh. - What do you know?
This is no snatch and grab job.
The local authorities are in Zade Black's pocket.
So, even if you make the street, that's the end of the road.
For all of you.
I think it's a piece of cake.
Yeah, sounds easy.
All right, do you have a picture of the suite, at least?
Only one.
Okay, let's see it.
Let's zoom in so we can see the background.
Link, help him. Come.
Let-- let her do it.
- Step aside. - No, no.
No one touches my computer.
Let her do her thing, Flowers.
Okay, a little blurry.
All right, zoom in.
- Just-- - Ah, there we go!
Ah, girl.
What do we got?
Okay, can you use this tech to make us new identities?
- Uh, fuck yeah. - Yeah?
But we're gonna need some coffee.
And food, too. I'm starvin'.
I could eat.
All right, Flowers.
We need food, we need coffee.
We gotta get to work.
Thank you.
All right, everyone. Here's our new identities.
What do we got?
Whoa, cool!
My name's Chico.
Wait a minute. Am I supposed to know Spanish?
I-- I failed Spanish in high school like three times.
No, it was more like four times.
But you don't have to speak Spanish.
But I'm tellin' y'all, right now,
you gotta know this shit from cover to cover.
Our lives are depending on it.
I'm Kai Ricci.
And I'm an investment banker.
I also teach hot yoga.
That's how I met Jenny.
I'm Jennifer Austin.
We're from Palo Alto, California.
I'm VC, specializing in tech startups, naturally.
And we're on our honeymoon.
I'm Clayton Gibson. AKA Clay G.
A musician from Atlanta, Georgia.
So you know I go hard. And I gamble the hardest.
But at heart, loyalty is what I live by.
So let's get it.
Hey, I'm Phil.
Got a last name, too, but I can't pronounce it.
Where I'm from,
it's not your concern, you understand?
Name, Cage.
Uh, Donovan Cage.
Wait a minute.
Donovan Cage is a real person.
Your cover could easily be blown.
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. This guy's different.
He never wants to be photographed.
He's a-- a billionaire. He likes to gamble.
This guy's a whale.
They're gonna roll out the red carpet for him
in the casino.
Thank you.
He's got several corporations all over the world.
He seldom leaves Asia.
And he's gregarious.
Now, no conservative bets.
You think Salazar's up for the big time?
Of course.
Okay, what's the marker?
Sky's the limit.
Mr. Cage.
It's my pleasure to welcome you to the Scarlet Pearl.
I'm Bella, executive director of the casino.
Well, it's my pleasure, Bella.
No need for mister, Don is just fine.
Quite a necklace you got there.
Is that for real?
Uh, only my jeweler and I know.
You have a sense of humor.
I was only just made aware of your arrival,
but I will do everything in my power
to make sure that your stay is as perfect as possible.
Oh, thank you.
Also, the casino's owner
regrets that he was not here to personally greet you
and thanks you for your $10 million deposit.
We've moved the guests from our finest luxury suite
so that you may have our best accommodation.
Oh, yeah, the penthouse.
One floor below.
The penthouse is where Mr. Black lives.
Oh, he doesn't want me to stay in his house while I'm here?
Just kidding.
Floor below is just fine, no worries.
May I show you to your suite?
No, I think I'm going to get a lay of the land here,
play a little cards.
We have a private room for you,
your own tables, your choice of dealers.
Nah, nah, nah.
I'm on vacation.
I wanna rub elbows with your most illustrious guests.
As you wish.
We're gonna be friends, Bella.
If you're scared to play, bet your money on Clay.
Let's get it.
Okay, we're gonna put some money down here.
We're gonna put some money here.
We're gonna put some money there.
Let's go. Roll the ball. Let's get it.
Let's go. Let's go.
Seven!
Yes, sir!
All right.
Let me get something on six.
Something in the field.
Let me get these dice for this hot hand man right here.
Ha!
- Don. - Clayton Gibson.
You look familiar. You ever been to Macau?
Uh, not yet, but, uh, it's on my list.
Yeah, well, if you ever go, I'd love to show you around.
- Yo. For the gentleman.
I'ma hold you to that.
- It's Don, right? - Uh, Clayton, right?
Yes, sir.
Come on, let me get these dice.
- Let's get it. - There you go.
Donovan Cage.
How do you like the view?
Are you monitoring me?
Really keeping an eye on Mr. Salazar's investment.
Oh, well, I'm up half a million crap,
so, uh, I guess he owes me.
I'm aware.
You got a guy on the inside?
We have eyes and ears everywhere.
Have you met Zade Black?
Not yet.
Mr. Black and Mr. Salazar are bitter enemies.
If Zade finds out who you're working for,
you will not be arrested.
Very likely, you will die a slow,
excruciating death.
Well, it sounds like you're telling me
to take care of myself.
That's very sweet.
I didn't know that you cared, Mr. Flowers.
You should start taking this seriously, Mason.
Take it seriously?
I'm as serious as a fucking heart attack.
Dick.
I understand you enjoy champagne.
Who doesn't?
It's a matter of mathematics and physics, isn't it?
The distance from your hand to the knife?
Our entire lives are dictated by the laws of time,
space, and distance.
Isn't that right, Amelia?
Or should I call you Amy?
Well, only my friends call me Amy.
Oh, maybe we'll end up friends.
Stranger things happen every day.
Somehow I doubt Abel Salazar has real friends.
Hmm?
You're still blinded by the myopic worldview
the federal government burned into your impressionable brain
back in Quantico.
I'm no boogeyman.
I'm just a man.
Okay.
Whatever you say, Abel.
According to the FBI, Mason Goddard is evil as well.
Taking what's not his,
ignoring the law of man and God,
breaking one of those sacred commandments
people live and die for.
And yet, you fell in love with him.
Yeah, well, he is pretty cute.
But listen, that's false equivalency.
Mason's never killed anyone.
Nor have I. Hand to God.
Listen, Abel,
if we're goin' to be friends, you probably shouldn't lie to me
right off the bat.
Okay, we'll call it semantics. Yes?
Because I know for a fact at least a dozen people
that you killed or-- or had killed.
There you go.
Ascribing super human powers to me.
If I could control people like you suggest,
I would still be a married man.
What exactly happened there?
Enough serious talk.
Let's eat.
Took me a little longer to hack
into the security system than I expected.
Um, okay, guys,
now we have complete control of all the cameras.
Good job, babe.
- Are those live images? - Yup.
And I found the purchase order for the safe.
German. Burg Wachter, custom made.
Biometric.
Only opens up with the skin on Zade's palm.
Biometric? Fuck.
It's not exactly my specialty.
Excuse me.
Si?
Muy bien.
You'll be happy to know Mason is doing really well.
The assignment I have him on
could even be seen as a vacation of sorts.
And who was that you were speaking with?
Oh, just someone I have keeping an eye on him.
Time.
Space.
Distance.
I've never killed anyone.
But you have, haven't you, Amelia?
What does it feel like to take someone's life...
with your own hands?
Mm.
The safe is behind that painting.
Somewhere up there.
- I'll go check. - All right.
Yeah.
Try right ab-- right above the door.
Ah, there you go.
Keep goin'.
Just do-- do a wider circle there.
Nothin'.
Right there. Try there.
Okay.
It's a lot of steel right there.
So close.
Yet so far.
Where's Anton and Hector?
No. They're on recon.
We could just cut a hole in the ceiling
and drop that sucker down here.
Oh, yeah.
No one would notice that, Shawn.
Hey, man. You know me. I'm just riffin'.
You're the boss.
So?
Boss?
What's the plan?
Hmm.
Yeah. What's the plan?
Fuck.
A lucky cat... gets nine lives.
While the loyal dog has to settle for one.
What kind of reward is that for a creature
known for such loyalty?
Zade.
Your men, they got it all wrong.
Fernando.
My loyal dog.
What have they done to you?
What do you mean?
What have they done?
They're keeping me responsible for the lost shipment!
Lost? No. No. No.
The shipment was stolen.
No, I know it was stolen, but it wasn't from me!
Pa, please!
I put that on my children!
On the soul of my wife!
I'm right here, Fernando.
Do you really care so little for my eternal soul?
Zade...
You know, she doesn't know what she's talkin' about.
I don't-- I don't do business with my wife, papi.
You gotta believe me.
Oh, you're full of shit!
I told him everything!
Everything.
Oh, my God.
Zade, please forgive me.
No. No. No. No, no!
Please! Please!
I don't know what I was thinkin' about, papi.
I'm so sorry!
I don't know what I was thinking about.
Please, let me make this up to you!
I'm so sorry!
Why did you do that?
My mind's not in a good place.
Please, you gotta forgive me.
Please. No!
Please.
Let me out!
Waste of a perfectly good cigar.
You gaze at me in fear.
That's wise, Adrianna.
Go home to your children.
Grieve this dog.
When you're ready,
we'll find a place for you in the organization.
I missed you.
You better have, my darling.
Here he comes.
Play it cool, Chico.
Remember, we're the most important people in the room.
Winner.
Hell yeah.
Mr. Cage.
Bella!
Hey, what'd I tell you about that mister stuff?
Uh, yes. Don.
I'm so excited to introduce you to Mr. Black.
How are you?
Donovan Cage in my casino.
It's an absolute honor.
Oh, thank you.
This is my right-hand man, Chico.
- Nice to meet you. - Pleasure.
What brings you to New Orleans?
Change of pace.
You know, a bit of a holiday.
And, you know, Macau has wealthy people.
And the VIPs is so predictable.
I just thought maybe I'd just find a place
that's a little earthier.
That's the first time my casino's been
described that way.
But I'm thrilled that you're enjoying yourself.
Well, thank you.
Please accept my apologies
I wasn't here to personally welcome you.
Oh, no. You're here now.
That's all that matters.
Would you like to join me for a drink?
I would love to join you for a drink.
- Excellent. - Okay.
I'll meet you soon.
Right this way.
Sure.
I was surprised to hear you declined the use
of one of our private gaming rooms.
Some of the biggest names in the country have played there.
Hmm.
Well, honestly, Zade,
unless it's one of your epic poker games,
I think I'd rather be on the floor with the people.
Wow!
You're making fast friends, I see.
Ah, well, I do okay.
We have some of the most gorgeous women in the world.
Oh, I'm sure you do.
If you need any introductions, just say the word.
Zade, are you telling me that I can't find my own companionship?
Mm-hmm?
If I offended you, Don, I'm-- I'm sorry.
No worries. Here. A toast.
Hmm.
Yes.
Hmm.
Mm, you know,
we have a mutual friend, you and I.
Who's that?
Chaz.
Chaz Antonelli.
Chaz.
He's a great guy.
Good card player.
Yeah.
By the way, you mentioned something
about my epic poker games.
Yes?
Would you be interested in joining us?
Of course.
I would be honored to host you.
Yes. Yes.
Well, good. I hear you're good.
Uh, more than good.
Uh-huh?
Well, I'm not. I'm rusty.
Well, I can't say that I would go easy on you.
It would be disrespectful.
Of course.
Well, I don't like to lose.
Oh, neither do I.
I fuckin' hate it, too.
- Clayton! - Hey, my man. Don.
- Hey. - We meet again.
Hey, what's your last name again?
Gibson.
- Gibson. - Yes, sir.
Zade, you must know Clayton Gibson.
Oh, I do now.
Zade Black.
Welcome to the Scarlet Pearl, Clay.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
You got yourself a fine establishment here.
I'm so pleased to see you're makin' the most of it.
Okay, so Zade has strong-armed me
into a poker game.
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
I'm tryin' to do the same thing.
Oh, would you be interested
in joining us in a private game, Clay?
Most definitely.
Yes.
Okay, well. Ah, Bella.
I feel like I've missed something significant.
What are you boys scheming?
We're talking about setting up a private game of poker
- in the penthouse. - Oh.
Well, I would be delighted to make those arrangements.
So long as I have a seat at the table.
You got game, too?
She's almost as good as I am.
Is that right?
Tomorrow night, then?
Oh, okay, if we're gonna do this,
we gotta do it right.
Big stakes.
Absolutely.
How high are we talking?
That's up to you.
Them the only stakes I play, the big stakes.
Oh, okay.
The big. Let's get it.
I love how you were shittin' all over his casino.
What did you call it? Earthy?
What was that about?
Men like Zade, they only respect power.
And I had to remind him that I have more of it.
Thus, he wants to impress me.
That dude's a slimeball.
Seems kind of dangerous.
I don't want you getting hurt.
Ah, I'm not worried.
I got good protection.
- You do? - Yeah.
- Oh, you mean me? - I'm-- I do.
I'm countin' on you, Chico.
- How's it going? - Mm-hmm.
Hey.
How does a bank manager learn how to dust prints?
I did my research.
We had biometric tech at the bank.
Oh, yeah?
Check this out.
Whoa! Trippy.
Do you have enough to work with?
Uh, I think so.
You think so?
What, you want me to blow smoke up your ass and say I'm sure?
I'm not.
This isn't exact science, guys.
Fair enough.
I'll scan this.
And assemble a digital model of Zade's right hand.
And we'll run some tests on the 3D printer.
Oh, that thing's dope.
- Yeah. - Yeah.
Richter.
Spotted Hector.
Where?
Casino.
You're shitting me.
Might want to get over here.
Yeah, copy that.
What's up, man?
Change of plans.
One of our informants spotted Hector Flores
at the Scarlet Pearl Casino in New Orleans.
You know who owns that place?
No, who?
Zade Black.
Are they there with the whole crew?
Yeah, I'm sure.
This guy Black is bad news.
They better not get on his bad side,
or it won't be much left of them for us to arrest.
Oh, shit.
Oh!
So how's it goin'?
Oh, we're set to go.
Surprise is good.
Mm-hmm.
You get some rest, boss?
Oh, you know me. I don't need rest.
Hello?
Who is this?
This is Donovan Cage.
Hello, Mason.
Uh, you got the wrong number, friend.
We're both on secure phones, so no need for subterfuge.
And most definitely, I'm not your friend.
Salazar?
I understand you intend to access the safe tonight.
Yes, but, uh,
don't you think it's time to tell us what we're looking for?
I will tell you when you open it.
Well, why all the secrecy?
What, does Zade have your soul locked up or something?
Oh, that's rather amusing.
I see that your reputation as an international fugitive
is very well earned.
Well, you got me curious, boss.
I mean, when I open this safe,
how are you goin' to tell us what to steal?
I'll be watchingeverything.
Amongst all that nifty gadgetry Mr. Flowers had delivered to
your suite,
there's a new comm system, complete with tiny cameras.
Link will love them.
And what if I-- What if I told you that
I don't-- I don't want to and I can't work
with someone breathing down my neck
and watching my every move?
Then I will tell you, you will never see Decker again.
Put her on the phone.
I can't risk distracting you.
Do it!
The finest boxers in the world
never get to talk to their woman before a fight.
I am notasking you,
I'm telling you, put her on the fuckin' phone!
I happen to have met the real Donovan Cage.
Small world.
The poker game was a clever move.
But dangerous.
My brother thinks very highly of his poker skills.
But he's a sore loser.
W-- w-- wait-- wait a minute.
Losing can make him violent.
Are you-- are you telling me that--
That Zade Black is your brother?
Mr. Flowers didn't mention that?
No, no, he didn't mention that
we're goin' to be in the middle of a deadly family feud.
He didn't.
Looking forward to tonight's festivities, Mason.
Spanish impaired moron.
Nice work, everyone.
Stay focused.
Tonight, anything less than perfection
is unacceptable.
Human perfection is impossible.
Ruben.
What are you doing here?
I'm so sorry, Bella.
I have a family emergency.
I'll come back to get him as soon as I can.
Don't worry. I know the drill.
I'll stay out of everyone's way.
I know you will, sweetheart.
Hello.
Bingo.
Oh, hi.
Okay, what do you think?
Look good to me.
What's going on?
There is a second safe.
- A second safe? - Yeah.
In the penthouse?
George found it.
In the staff bedroom down the hallway.
Behind that painting.
Shit.
On the bright side, I did a search
and found the purchase order.
Same custom model.
He probably has it programmed to open with the same palm scan
like the other one.
Probably.
Fuck me.
Yeah, my point exactly, man.
So what? What do we do, huh?
How do we look?
- Yo.
Ooh!
Oh, shit.
What happened now?
Okay, worst case, we check both safes.
And we use the same glove, right, for both?
I mean, that's even if it works, man.
I mean, honestly.
Not helpful, Hector.
Somebody gonna tell us what's goin' on?
What do you mean both safes?
Okay, Link.
- Hello? - Any ideas?
I think the best move
is to access them both at the exact same time.
Yeah, she's right.
We either hit both safes simultaneously or pick one.
We're makin' another glove.
But it's just not gonna be ready in time.
We already have two gloves.
No, one's already out of commission.
How?
It has started to disintegrate.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
How long does it take to make a second glove?
About an hour.
That's cool.
Let's-- let's do it.
All right. Well, it's time to go, right?
Yes, it is, Chico.
Check your camera.
Cameras are a go.
Ear pieces in.
Okay, so what's the plan?
The plan is to play some jazz, brother.
Let's get it.
It's showtime.
Jazz?
Yeah, jazz.
Zade!
Oh, there he is.
How are you?
- Welcome, my friend. - Uh, thank you.
- Welcome. - Thank you.
No doubt about it.
This is the place that I should be staying.
This guy is such a ballbuster.
Clayton!
- Yes, sir. - How you doin'?
- You ready to lose some money? - Oh, yeah.
Gonna call this Clay G's Casino when I'm done.
- He's feisty tonight! - Yes, sir.
- Get ready, everybody. - My house.
And don't you look dashing tonight.
And you--
My dear, look stunning.
I love that dress.
Thank you.
Who's this?
Uh...
So, I hear you're a billionaire.
This is my nephew Ruben.
He's very precocious.
Well, I'm Don, and yes, you are correct.
I wanna be a trillionaire.
I believe you.
Maybe one day I'll-- I'll ask you for a loan.
I charge interest.
Smart boy.
Yeah.
Don, you have to try the shrimp.
Today's fresh catch right off my boat.
And the drinks are being made
by the finest mixologist in the South.
Oh, you're tryin' to get me drunk
to get all my money.
Is that what he's trying to do?
I don't need any unfair advantages
to take all your money, Don.
God has gifted me with that elusive combination
of luck and talent.
Ah, very good.
Well, back to the drinks then.
Be creative. What do you want to drink?
We've got the best bartender in the world here.
A beer.
Huh.
You're hilarious, Chico.
Uh, gin martini for me would be great.
I like beer.
Welcome to New Orleans, Mr. Antonelli.
I'm Tanya.
They didn't tell me how cute you are.
You are a sweetheart, Tanya.
I've been instructed to take you directly
to Mr. Black's penthouse at the Scarlet Pearl.
I heard Donovan Cage is there?
Yes, sir.
He can't wait to see you.
Then what are we waiting for?
Here you go, babe.
Okay.
Time to loop in, Dr. Evil.
Testing.
One, two, three.
Mr. Salazar, can you hear me?
Good evening, Link.
How are you?
Um, a little pissed you fucked up my wedding day.
Marriage as an institution is a bigger failure
than the modern banking system.
I did you a favor.
But I had the cutest dress.
Anyway, you can monitor tonight's proceedings
via the hidden cameras.
Our boys will be able to hear you
should you wish to cheer them on.
So grab some popcorn
and let's hope this doesn't turn into a snuff film.
I know you're joking,
but in addition to being the shrimp king,
Zade happens to own the largest collection
of authentic snuff films in the world.
Good to know.
Um, give me a shout if you encounter any technical issues.
Welcome, gentlemen.
Don, here to my right.
- Oh. - Chico and Clay.
- And this is your seat? - Yes.
- Ah, to my left, really? - Hmm.
Okay.
Lucy, I'm so glad you could join us.
You know I never miss a chance to shake down your rich friends.
Gentlemen.
- Cheers. - Wonderful.
- Cheers. - Wonderful.
Escort him directly up to the penthouse.
I have a surprise for you, Don.
Is that right?
Our mutual friend, Chaz Antonelli,
has touched down in New Orleans.
He'll be joining us shortly.
- Chaz? He's-- he's here? - Mm-hmm.
Yeah, he was very excited to know that you were here.
Oh, my goodness. Wow!
Wonderful.
Well, uh, I hope you have some lovely ladies on hand.
Of course. I'm the consummate wingman.
I know you are.
The minimum, as you know, is $1 million to start.
Okay.
May the best person win.
Let's begin.
Let's do this.
I do need popcorn.
This evening just got much more interesting.
Don't worry, Mason.
In all our spare time,
we'll try to monitor Antonelli's location.
How's our glove?
Almost ready.
You need to get changed.
Into what?
Raise.
Raise, 200k.
I raise 300,000.
I call.
I raise 500,000.
I call.
I have a straight.
I raise 100,000.
All in.
Raise?
I don't believe you.
I call.
All in.
You know what, Zade?
I raise half a million.
I call.
Only thing I'm foldin' is the money, baby.
I'm all in.
I raise 100,000.
I raise 300,000.
I call 300,000.
Ah, fuck, man.
I'm all in.
I fold.
I fold.
So how you two meet?
It's actually quite scandalous.
I was in a relationship
with someone that Zade knows quite well.
How well?
Well, I didn't think
I would be showing my cards so early in the evening,
but since we're all friends, I'll be frank.
Bella was in a relationship with my brother.
Damn!
Been there, done that, honey.
Um, what happened?
He didn't deserve her, so I took her.
Simple as that.
That's cold.
Maybe I took you, dear.
The bottom line is he lost and I won.
God damn it.
You better get to that safe before I call an airstrike
and level that entire casino!
Fuck!
Um, cheers to you.
And to you.
Don, you have an executive assistant,
- Ms. Connors? - Yes.
Um, unfortunately, she's barely competent,
- but, uh... - She's requested a word.
Send the buzzkill in, please.
Chico can handle it.
I'll handle it.
No more interruptions.
Ah, of course he's fucking cheating.
For fuck's sake.
Zade, when are you ever gonna grow up?
I'm all in.
I'm out.
Me, too.
You got it.
I'm afraid I am, too, babe.
All in.
Flush.
Well played.
Bravo, Zade.
Well played, indeed.
You knew that little fucker's got something hot,
and yet you throw my money away.
All part of the plan, Salazar.
Mason's keeping your brother smug and off guard.
God damn it, Mason.
What's Antonelli's status, babe?
Yeah, less than five minutes out.
He's got a security tail.
I don't think I can make a move.
We're running out of time.
ETA, Hector?
All right, we're good to go here.
It's now or never, Mason.
Excuse me a moment, please.
Hector, light him up.
All right, let's do it.
This is my kind of poker game.
Y'all do fireworks here, too?
Me, too. I love fireworks.
This is a lovely surprise, darling.
Anything for you, my dear.
Ruben, come watch the fireworks.
I'm busy, Mom!
Spread the wealth, Link.
This algorithm is gonna make some folks very happy.
Jackpot.
I won! I won!
Looping security cam's footage in the bedrooms...
...now.
The safe will be hidden, under a desk,
behind a picture or a mirror.
Now that looks promising, Mason.
There should be a small lever on the side
or at the bottom behind the frame.
Check the bedroom, Shawn.
I'm in.
Bingo, Mason.
Look for a small lever, Shawn.
Can't find the lever.
Are you a fuckin' idiot, Shawn.
Not nice, Salazar.
You got this, Shawn.
Other-- other side of the frame, Shawn.
Oh, you got it, Shawn.
The gloves are delicate.
Be careful.
We need all the fingers and the palms intact.
You guys ready?
We've been hacked. Shut down the slot.
Contain whoever was playing the machines
with the payouts.
We found the source of the fireworks.
It's a pickup truck.
No one's here, though.
They're headin' up.
You guys ready?
Ready.
Ready.
Remember, it needs to be at the exact same time.
Press your palms gently against the sensor
on my go.
Three.
Two.
One.
Go.
Ah, got it.
Huh!
Okay, time to spill.
What are we looking for?
Take all the hard drives.
All hard drives.
Okay. We got cash.
We got paperwork.
Nothin' in there.
Got jewelry.
Jewelry box.
Hard drives come in all shapes and sizes.
They could be hidden.
Nothin' in the lining.
You guys have to hurry.
I don't see any hard drive.
It must be in there! Keep looking!
No, I'm lookin', man.
It's a bust for me, too.
It's just jewelry and cash.
Wait, hold on.
What? Wh-- what is it?
No! No!
No fuckin' way!
Huh.
Found a hard drive.
Shawn, get out of there,
now!
Ruben!
Hey, kiddo.
Come on.
Let's go get you a cheeseburger.
So, what did I miss?
Just some goddamn fireworks.
Oh, yeah?
Uh, just my luck.
No worries.
Chaz is on his way up.
Great.
Now, Zade, hasn't gotten cold feet or something, has he?
Uh, just attending to some casino business.
So, he'll be here soon.
Oh, problem?
Uh, no.
Bartender, can I get another beer, please?
You know how much I'm paying this bartender.
I would think you'd be a little more adventurous.
All right.
Mm, what do you suggest, Bella?
Mm, Cuba libre?
Okay.
Cuba libre, please?
No idea if this is gonna work.
Okay. I'll be right there.
Everything okay?
Um, it appears Chaz is stuck in the elevator.
Ugh. Really?
Oh, no. Chaz is not gonna like that.
Minor hiccup.
Well, take your time.
We'll make sure you get your money's worth out of the bar.
Make 'em stronger this time.
Enjoy, gentlemen.
Zade and I will be back shortly.
Okay. We got it.
Casino security got Hector.
Oh, shit.
Excuse me, ladies.
I'm gonna be right back.
Y'all stay put now.
We'll get him back.
How?
Just one thing at a time.
Come on. Hard drive.
- Let's do it. - Okay. Fuck.
Okay, let's see what Dr. Evil is so hot for.
Looks like a blockchain wallet.
Uh-huh.
Oh, my God.
This is it.
This is it.
What is it? What's it?
You remember Isabel Farrow,
the crazy rich socialite whose crypto wallet I thought
was stored in the bank in Seattle?
- Right. - This is it!
This is the 600 million that I was talkin' about!
This is it! We got it!
We finally got it!
You know what I think?
I think-- I think Bella is Isabel Farrow.
She left Salazar for Zade.
- Right? - That tracks.
But it-- it doesn't-- it doesn't totally make sense.
- What do you mean? - Think about it.
Salazar's one of the richest people in the world.
He doesn't need $600 million.
Okay? So he wants something else.
He said, "Look for a hard drive."
Oh, fuck.
It's-- it's the dirt box.
- Again? - Mm-hmm.
Bella goes to her safe box. Right?
She gets her crypto wallet,
and she makes a clone of the dirt box
and brings it down to Zade.
Okay. Now, Zade is competitive with his brother.
So he thinks if he uses the dirt box in the right way,
he could take over.
He could be the power. He could take the throne.
That explains why Salazar has been so coy
about what we're after.
- He's paranoid. - Yeah.
He's totally paranoid that we're gonna upload it again for us.
But I was right about the crypto wallet, right?
- Yes, Shawn. - Uh?
We-- we established that a couple of times.
But if it's not in one of Zade's safes,
- where could it be? - Okay.
Well, it's not in the jewelry box.
And it's not in the thumb drive.
So, we have to keep-- we have to keep looking.
What am I looking for?
I think that we look for anything he's purchased
in the last few months.
Especially if it's-- if-- if it's custom-made.
Okay.
Uh-uh.
Oh, nice and easy.
Sweet dreams.
This is Don.
Tell me Shawn found the drive.
It's not the dirt box, Abel.
You have nothing to worry about.
All I want is Amy back.
Then you better fucking find it.
Oh, hello there.
Fuck.
Not lovin' it, huh?
I knew you were gonna try this.
I'm just surprised it took you this long.
What were you gonna do?
Try to kill me?
Maybe.
I knew you were a killer.
I never said I wasn't.
And you never told me what it feels like
to take someone's life.
- Hmm. - Tell me.
Okay. Well...
...that all depends.
On what?
Well...
Well, if the person really, really deserves it,
like their mere existence causes pain and suffering,...
...it kind of feels like sex.
Ooh.
His weapon is loaded.
Hollow points.
Champagne?
Can't help a girl from trying.
Salud.
I need you to clean this up.
Uh, it ain't coronavirus, guys.
Don't worry about it, all right?
Don't worry.
You guys all nervous. You know what I mean?
This guy right here, that's your boss?
Yeah?
Got the whole squad here, huh?
What up?
Who are you?
I'm Phil.
Who the fuck are you?
You trying to steal from me, Phil?
Steal from you?
My mom taught me better than that.
Come on, man.
Just playing with some fireworks.
You know what I'm saying?
Get 'em in Mexico, dog.
At the same time, my slots get hacked.
You think I'm stupid?
I don't think you're stupid.
I mean, I think you look stupid, but I don't know.
Are you stupid?
I wrap my own material, by the way.
Have a seat, man.
Why not?
900 degrees Celsius.
That's how hot a burning cigar can get.
I bet you didn't know that.
Nah.
I was absent that day.
It's kind of wild, huh?
It's interesting.
Who you working with?
Hey, man, let me make something clear to you, all right?
I had a few of your drinks.
They were spiked. They were free.
Everything tastes better when it's free.
You know what I mean?
You got the wrong idea about me, homeboy.
Get that through your head.
Do you have any idea
what 900 degrees does to the human eyeball?
Okay, Shawn, you come with me.
Link, keep goin'.
- The feds are here. - What?
I said the feds are here!
Richter?
Yeah, in the lobby.
What do we do now?
Just keep playing jazz. Come on.
Shawn, let's go.
Okay, we should split.
I'm-- I'm busy.
We can get out of here, just the two of us.
You know how we roll, right?
If this ship's going down, I'm going down with it.
So let me work.
Yeah, okay. Sorry.
Whoever you're protecting...
Uh-huh.
I promise, they're not worth that kind of pain.
All right.
That's something to think about.
To be honest,
I was planning on doin' this anyway.
This is Zade.
Mr. Zade, uh, we--
Yes, Tanya, what is it?
We have a little problem with the elevator.
The fucking elevator?
Yes, sir.
Uh, we got him out
and he's finally in the penthouse now,
but Mr. Antonelli is very upset.
Um, he wants to see you immediately.
Tell him I'll be right up.
To be continued, Phil.
Shit.
There's Richter and his whole fucking team.
You go around this way.
You two with me.
You go secure our escape route.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
- I'll cover West Side. - I'll take this one.
Babe?
Since when do you have a second burner?
Caras, can you hear me?
Mason knows we're after the dirt box.
Make sure he finds it.
But do not let your little girlfriend upload it.
Hey, sweetie.
It was you.
What?
You wiped my servers the night of our fucking wedding.
It's not what it looks like, Link.
Do not fucking touch me.
You got me drunk, so I passed out.
You scanned my face and my thumb.
Is that about right?
Yeah, it's true.
I fuckin' hated Mason for making me look like a fool
in my own bank.
I wanted revenge.
Uh.
Salazar was threatening to kill my family, sweetie.
I don't wanna hear this.
I got to know you guys.
Everything changed.
I don't wanna hear this.
You gotta believe me.
Do not touch me!
I don't wanna hear this.
I love you, Link.
I love you more than anything else.
Do not fuckin' say this to me!
Get out.
- Get the fuck out. - Please.
Get the fuck out now.
Get out!
Are you okay?
- You heard that? - I did.
I'm so sorry.
Um, I'm over it.
Um, back to work.
Clearly you're not.
And neither am I.
I'm diving back into the purchase orders.
There's a lot of them.
I was thinking, you know, casinos have safe deposit boxes.
Yeah, um, don't second guess your instincts.
Zade is way too impressed with himself to be that basic.
Don!
There you are.
So sorry for the disruption, but we are ready to resume,
and Chaz is anxiously awaiting your arrival.
Okay, well, give me 20 minutes.
I have some business to do with Chico, and I'll be back.
I'm afraid I must insist you come with me now.
Well, normally I would be insulted by that kind of thing,
but you've got me intrigued.
So because you're the lady of the house,
I, uh, I'm all yours.
Shall we?
Chaz looks well.
You can hardly detect his limp anymore.
Chaz has never had a limp.
I think you know that, Bella.
Who are you?
- I'm Donovan Cage. - I don't think so.
Far too many strange things have been happening tonight,
and you seem to be at the center of all of them.
I'm intrigued, however.
You obviously have deep pockets,
and I consider myself a businesswoman.
I could possibly be persuaded to help you
with whatever it is you're looking for
if the price is right.
Are you speaking on behalf of Zade?
I speak on behalf of only myself.
Their loyalty lies with me.
What Zade doesn't know won't hurt him.
Hmm.
You may speak freely.
Jackpot, Mason.
Zade paid a fortune for what's gonna be
one of themost expensive hidden compartments
in the world.
Oh, yeah?
This is your last chance.
It's inside of a big Ruby.
No, I can speak freely.
I don't have a clue of what you're talking about.
And if you don't mind,
I'd like you to stop wasting my fucking time
and take me to my dear friend Chaz Antonelli.
I'm disappointed, Mr. Cage.
You said we were gonna be friends.
We're not gonna be friends.
As you wish.
Chaz!
Chaz!
Chaz, it's me. It's Don.
How are you?
Uh, you look great.
You look like you gained some weight.
Who the fuck are you?
Link, plan B.
Who the fuck is this guy?
That man, he was not Donovan Cage, no.
He took my necklace.
He took my necklace.
Go!
Go find him!
Let's go, Link. Checkout time!
Okay. On my way.
Mason, let's go!
You're never getting out of here alive!
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
Man all the exits.
I want the entire perimeter surrounded by local police!
Oh, hell yeah, man!
What took you so long, man?
Shit.
- Better late than never, my boy. - Ha-ha! Come on, now.
Yeah.
- What's up, man? - Come on, now.
Security.
Go.
Find him and bring him to me.
Zade, they're headed to the theater.
Hands up, guys.
What's happening, Agent Richter?
Oh, good. You made it.
Yeah.
- Did you hear that? - Yeah. Feds got 'em.
That's bad.
- Is this it? - Yeah.
- This will take us to the shrimp factory. - Okay, let's go.
- Okay. - You lead.
Go. Go. Go.
You guys are full of surprises.
Get out.
Get out where I can see you.
You surprised me, too, with that ace up your sleeve.
I know you like to win, but, uh,
it must have been hard for you, huh?
Your older brother Abel always havin' to be the winner.
My fuckin' brother.
Of course.
He sent you.
Give me the necklace.
I can't do that.
Your brother will kill the woman I love,
and I can't do that.
And?
And that's not gonna happen.
That's your plan?
That's my plan.
You know how much the information hidden
on that necklace is worth?
I do.
I don't believe you're gonna trade it
for the life of some woman.
I am.
You're not a whale.
You're nothing but a fucking minnow!
George!
Drop it.
I'm sorry.
Okay, just one second.
You're not gonna get the necklace, Bella.
I want nothing to do with that necklace.
Zade stole something from me, and I'm gonna get it back.
You guys should get out of here.
Let's go. Come on.
What the fuck was that?
Come on! Get him up!
Come on.
Come on.
Get him in. Help-- help him in. Link first.
Let-- let me go, let me go!
Go on. Go on.
What the fuck!
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, guys.
Got a tail.
They're going through the shrimp processing plant.
Guys, this way.
Let's go. Let's go.
Go, go, go, go, go!
Come on, move it!
Come on.
Come on.
Go! Go!
Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!
Come, come.
This way. This way.
Come on, let's go!
Come, come.
This way. This way. This way.
Go! Go!
Let's go! Let's go!
How exciting!
Come on, Mason. Put the gun down.
I was led to believe you were no murderer.
Just protecting my family.
You okay, Amy?
I'm okay, baby.
It's good to see you.
Relax.
It's your boss's dirt box.
Ah, how cute.
Zade always did love his little shiny toys.
How do I know you didn't upload these on the way over, Link?
I'm so done with your dirt, Salazar.
Okay. We came through for you.
Let us have Amy.
Come on.
After all you put me through in Seattle,
you really think I can forgive and forget?
Abel, this is a fucking deal, man.
This is a deal.
Decker or the dirt box?
That's right.
I intend to honor it with one minor caveat.
What?
I don't know if she'd admit it,
but I was a gracious host to Amelia.
We shared a nice meal
and had an interesting conversation.
She implied I was a murderer.
But I had to correct her.
I have personally never killed a single human being.
Later, Amy told me that the feeling of doing so,
of murdering someone, was rather erotic.
Well, not my exact words.
Assuming the person being killed was deserving of it.
But I have a grim view of humanity.
I'm not a Bible man.
But I do see the logic of original sin.
No one is innocent.
So, given my world view,
and if Decker's assessment is accurate,
then I have really been missing out.
Makes me regret not killing my wife myself.
I don't know who's more fucked up.
You or your brother Zade.
You came through with the dirt box,
so you can take Decker.
Thank you.
But if you do that, I will kill Shawn.
You're so fucking sick.
That's not the deal.
You don't want your brother to die?
Fine!
Then I'll kill Decker, the love of your life.
You choose, Mason.
Okay, you wanna get a kick out of killing someone.
Is that right?
Choose me.
- Mason. - Kill me, Abel.
- Mason. - Yes.
- No, no. You kill me. - Shawn.
Kill me!
Shawn, shut up. Shut up.
Do it.
Do it.
Come on, motherfucker. Do it.
Come on, man.
Do it.
- Oh, yeah? - I wanna see it, Abel.
Come on, motherfucker. Do it.
Do it.
Do it.
Freeze! FBI!
You're completely surrounded!
Put the gun down!
Down!
Get on your knees!
Right now!
Get down!
Come on, Salazar.
Tell your men to lower their weapons.
You wanna end it all right here.
Come on.
Why don't you give your team of lawyers a chance
to get you out of this?
You and all your money against Uncle Sam.
What do you say?
I have diplomatic immunity.
My legal team will bury you.
Take their weapons.
Cuff 'em.
Jesus Christ, it took you long enough.
Yeah, you are right.
Nice to see you, Amy.
Vern. Mace. What's goin' on?
Did you set this up?
You go secure our escape route. Go ahead.
Go ahead.
And you guys over there.
Hello?
Richter. This is Mason.
What do you say we make a deal?
I'm listening.
Did you set this up?
You're a fuckin' idiot, Mason!
You just fucked us all!
Open it.
All right. Everybody out.
What's up?
baby. Yeah!
How you doing, my man?
Ah.
It's awesome to see you guys.
All right. Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's goin' on here?
Get a room! Get a room! Get a room!
Oh, my God.
Mason. What did you do?
Well, he cut a deal.
- I can tell 'em? - Go ahead.
- It's official? - Official.
Go ahead.
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm sorry, everybody.
I wanted to tell you earlier, but I couldn't
until it was official.
You're good.
So you know that we were, you know, proudly
on the most wanted FBI list,
but nothing compared to Salazar.
That's right.
And as promised, you delivered him
and his dirt box into federal custody.
And got each of you immunity.
Yeah, yeah.
But don't fuck it up.
I don't wanna come after you again, guys.
- Oh, my God. - All right.
Mason, right behind, you got your jet fully fueled
and ready to go as promised.
- Yeah. - What? What?
- That-- that's our jet? - All right, let's go.
That-- that's really our jet?
You're so clever. You're the most--
Hey. Hey!
Guys, guys, guys.
Check this out. Check this out.
What is that?
- Mason, you wanna tell 'em? - No, you, man. Go ahead.
You remember the hard drive
that we were trying to get in Seattle?
No.
- Oh, stop it. How much? - Yeah.
You shittin' me, homeboy.
600 million.
For real? Oh, my God!
Let's go!
Kids, I'm gonna tell you an incredible story ;
the story of how I met your mother.
Are we being punished for something ?
No.
Yeah, is this gonna take a while ?
Yes. 25 years ago, before I was Dad,
I had this whole other life.
It was way back in 2005.
I was 27, just starting to make it as an architect
and living in New York with Marshall, my best friend from college.
My life was good.
And then Uncle Marshall went and screwed the whole thing up.
Will you marry me ?
Yes. Perfect !
And then you're engaged. You pop the champagne.
You drink a toast.
You have sex on the kitchen floor.
Don't have sex on our kitchen floor.
Got it.
Thanks for helping me plan this out, Ted.
Dude, are you kidding ? It's you and Lilly.
I've been there for all the big moments of you and Lilly :
night you met, your first date, other first things.
Yeah, sorry. We thought you were asleep.
It's physics, Marshall.
If the bottom bunk moves, the top bunk moves, too.
My God.
You're getting engaged tonight.
Yeah. What are you doin' tonight ?
What was I doing ?
Here Uncle Marshall was taking the biggest step of his life.
And me ?
I'm calling up your Uncle Barney.
Hey, so you know how I've always had a thing for half-Asian girls ?
Well, now I've got a new favorite... Lebanese girls.
Lebanese girls are the new half-Asians.
Hey, you want to do somethin' tonight ?
Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes. And suit up !
Where's your suit ?
Just once, when I say suit up, I wish you'd put on a suit.
I did that one time.
It was a blazer !
You know, ever since college it's been, Marshall and Lilly and me.
Now, it's gonna be Marshall and Lilly... and me.
They'll get married, start a family.
Before long, I'm that weird, middle-aged bachelor their kids call Uncle Ted.
I see what this is about.
Have you forgotten what I said to you the night we met ?
Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.
Barney. We met at the urinal.
Oh, right. Right.
Lesson one : lose the goatee.
It doesn't go with your suit.
- I'm not wearing a suit. - Lesson two : get a suit.
Suits are cool. Exhibit "A."
Lesson three : don't even think about getting married till you're 30.
30. Right. You're right.
I guess it's just, your best friend gets engaged,
you start thinking about that stuff.
I thought I was your best friend.
Ted, say I'm your best friend.
You're my best friend, Barney.
Good. Then, as your best friend,
I suggest we play a little game I like to call
- "Have you met Ted ?" - Wait. No, no, no.
We're not playing "Have you met Ted ?"
Hi, have you met Ted ?
Hi, I'm Ted.
Yasmine.
That's a very pretty name.
Thanks. It's Lebanese.
I'm exhausted.
It was finger-painting day at school,
and a five year-old boy got to second base with me.
Wow ! You're cooking ?
Yes, I am.
Aw...
Are you sure that's a good idea ?
After last time, you looked really creepy without eyebrows.
I can handle this.
I think you'll find I'm full of surprises tonight.
So, there's more surprises ? Like what ?
Marshall was in his second year of law school,
so he was pretty good at thinking on his feet.
Boogedyboo !
And that's all of 'em.
I'm gonna go... cook.
I'm so happy for Marshall, I really am.
I just couldn't imagine settling down right now.
So, do you think you'll ever get married ?
Well, maybe eventually...
some fall day, possibly in Central Park.
Simple ceremony. We'll write our own vows.
Band, no DJ. People will dance !
I'm not gonna worry about it !
Damn it, why did Marshall have to get engaged ?
Yeah, nothing hotter than a guy planning out his own imaginary wedding, huh ?
- Actually, I think it's cute. - Well, you're clearly drunk.
One more for the lady !
Oh, hey, look what I got.
Oh, honey ! Champagne.
Yeah.
No. You are too old to be scared to open a bottle of champagne.
- I'm not scared. - Then open it.
Fine.
Please open it ?
You are unbelievable, Marshall.
There are two big questions a man has to ask in life.
One, you plan out for months.
The other just slips out when you're half drunk at some bar.
Will you marry me ?
You wanna go out sometime ?
Of course, you idiot !
I'm sorry, Carl's my boyfriend.
'Sup, Carl ?
I promised Ted we wouldn't do that.
Did you know there's a Pop Tart under your fridge ?
No, but dibs.
Where's that champagne ?
I wanna drink a toast with my fiancée.
I don't know why I was so scared of this.
It's pretty easy, right ?
Why am I freaking out all of a sudden ?
This is crazy. I'm not ready to settle down.
How does Carl land a Lebanese girl ?
The plan has always been don't even think about it until you're 30.
Exactly. The guy doesn't even own a suit.
Plus, Marshall's found the love of his life.
Even if I was ready, which I'm not...
but if I was, it's, like, "Okay, I'm ready. Where is she ?"
And there she was.
It was like something from an old movie,
where the sailor sees the girl across the crowded dance floor,
turns to his buddy and says, "See that girl ?
I'm gonna marry her someday."
Hey, Barney, see that girl ?
Oh, yeah. You just know she likes it dirty.
Go say hi.
I can't just go say hi.
I need a plan.
I'm gonna wait until she goes to the bathroom,
then I'll strategically place myself by the jukebox...
Hi, have you met Ted ?
Let me guess... Ted.
Sorry, Lilly. I'm so sorry.
- Take us to the hospital. - Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you hit her ?
Hit me ? Please !
This guy can barely even spank me in bed for fun.
He's all like, "Oh, honey. Did that hurt ?"
And, I'm like, "Come on ! Let me have it, you pansy !"
- Wow, a complete stranger. - No, no, no, no ! It's okay.
Go on.
So, these, uh, spankings...
you in pajamas or au naturel ?
So, what do you do ?
I'm a reporter for Metro News One.
Well, kind of a reporter.
I do those dumb little fluff pieces at the end of the news.
You know, like, um...
monkey who can play the ukulele.
I'm hoping to get some bigger stories soon.
Bigger, like, uh... gorilla with an upright bass ?
Sorry. You're really pretty.
Oh, your friends don't seem to happy.
Yeah, see, the one in the middle just got dumped by her boyfriend.
So, tonight, every guy is "the enemy."
You know if it'll make your friend feel better,
you could throw a drink in my face. I don't mind.
She would love that !
And it does look fun in the movies.
Hey, you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night ?
Oh, I can't.
I'm going to Orlando for a week on Friday.
Some guy's attempting to make the world's biggest pancake.
Guess who's covering it ?
That's gonna take a week ?
Yeah, he's gonna eat it, too. It's another record.
Hey ! What's takin' so long ?
Uh, I know this is a long shot, but how 'bout tomorrow night ?
Yeah. What the hell ?
Jerk !
That was fun.
De... wait for it... nied !
Denied !
We're goin' out tomorrow night.
I thought we were playin' laser tag tomorrow night.
Yeah, I was never gonna go play laser tag.
The next night, I took her out to this little bistro in Brooklyn.
That is one badass blue French horn.
Yeah.
Sort of looks like a Smurf penis.
Son, a piece of advice :
when you go on a first date, you really don't wanna say "Smurf penis."
Girls don't ordinarily like that.
But this was no ordinary girl.
Lilly ?
How long have you been sitting there ?
Stupid eye patch.
Mom, Dad, I have found the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.
Marshall, how have I always described my perfect woman ?
Now, let's see... she likes dogs ?
I've got five dogs.
She drinks scotch ?
I love a scotch that's old enough to order its own scotch.
Can quote obscure lines from Ghostbusters ?
Ray ! When someone asks you if you're a god, you say "Yes !"
And I'm saving the best for last.
Do you want these ? I hate olives.
She hates olives ! Awesome !
The olive theory.
The olive theory is based on my friends Marshall and Lilly.
He hates olives, she loves them.
In a weird way, that's what makes them such a great couple.
Perfect balance.
You know, I've had a jar of olives just sitting in my fridge forever.
I could take 'em off your hands.
They're all yours.
Oh, it is on !
It is on till the break of dawn.
But wait.
It's only the break of 10:30. What happened ?
I gotta get one of those blue French horns for over my fireplace.
It's gotta be blue. It's gotta be French.
- No green clarinet ? - Nope.
Come on. No purple tuba ?
It's a Smurf penis or no dice.
There you are !
We got a jumper.
Some crazy guy on the Manhattan Bridge.
Come on. You're coverin' it !
Um... all right. I'll be right there.
I'm sorry.
I had a really great time tonight.
Yeah.
So ?! Did you kiss her ?
No. The moment wasn't right.
Look, this woman could actually be my future wife.
I want our first kiss to be amazing.
Aw, Ted, that is so sweet.
So you chickened out like a little bitch.
What ? I did not chicken out.
You know what ?
I don't need to take first kiss advice from some pirate
who hasn't been single since the first week of college.
Anyone who's single would tell you the same thing,
even the dumbest single person alive.
And if you don't believe me, call him.
Hey, loser.
How's not playing laser tag ?
Because playing laser tag is awesome !
- Oh, I killed you, Conner ! - Don't make me get your mom !
Hey, listen. I need your opinion on something.
Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes.
And suit up !
So, these guys think I chickened out.
What do you think ?
I can't believe you're still not wearing a suit.
She didn't even give me the signal.
What, is she gonna, she gonna bat her eyes ayou in Morse code ?
"Ted... kiss me." No ! You just kiss her !
Not if you don't get the signal.
Did Marshall give me the signal ?
No ! I didn't. I swear.
But, see, at least tonight,
I get to sleep knowing Marshall and me,
never gonna happen.
You should have kissed her.
Oh, I should have kissed her.
Well, maybe in a week when she gets back from Orlando.
A week ? That's like a year in hot girl time.
She'll forget all about you.
Mark my words... you will never see that one again.
There she is.
Ooh ! She's cute. Hey, Carl, turn it up.
...persuaded him to reconsider.
At which point, the man came down off the ledge,
giving this bizarre story a happy ending.
- Reporting from Metro One News... - Guy didn't jump.
I'm gonna go kiss her.
Right now.
Look, dude. It's midnight.
As your future lawyer, I'm gonna advise you that's freakin' crazy.
I never do anything crazy.
I'm always waiting for the moment, planning the moment.
Well, she's leaving tomorrow.
This may be the only moment I'm gonna get.
I gotta do what that guy couldn't.
I gotta take the leap !
Okay, not a perfect metaphor,
'cause for me it's fall in love and get married,
and for him it's... death.
Actually, that is a perfect metaphor.
By the way, did I congratulate you two ?
I'm doing this.
Let's go.
- Word up. - We're coming with you.
Barney ?
All right, but under one condition.
Look at you, you beautiful bastard. You suited up !
This is totally going in my blog !
Stop the car.
Uh, pull over right here.
I gotta do something.
Excuse me. Pardon me. Just a sec'.
Enjoy your coffee.
Go ! Go ! Go !
Everybody brings flowers.
Okay.
Moment of truth.
Wish me luck.
Ted's gonna get it on with a TV reporter.
"This just in." Okay.
Kiss her, Ted ! Kiss her good !
Kiss the crap outta that girl !
Marshall, remember this night.
When you're the best man at our wedding and you give a speech,
you're gonna tell this story.
Why does he get to be the best man ?
I'm your best friend !
As I walked up to that door, a million thoughts raced through my mind.
Unfortunately, one particular thought did not.
I've got five dogs.
Not good. Not good.
- No ! - Get back in there !
You're wearing a suit !
Ted ?
Hi.
I was just, uh...
Come on up.
He's in.
So...
Ranjit, you must have done it with a Lebanese girl ?
Okay, that's my Barney limit.
I'm gonna see if that bodega has a bathroom.
Actually, I'm from Bangladesh.
The women hot there ?
Here's a picture of my wife.
A simple "no" would have sufficed.
She's lovely.
So, Ted, what brings you back to Brooklyn at 1:00 in the morning in a suit ?
I was just hoping to...
get those olives...
that you said I could have.
Would you like those olives with some gin and vermouth ?
Are you trying to get me drunk ?
For starters.
So, Marshall, this olive theory, based on you and Lilly ?
You hate olives.
Lilly loves 'em. You can't stand 'em.
Yeah. Hate olives.
Two weeks ago, Spanish bar on 79th street, dish of olives, you had some... what up ?
You have to swear that this does not leave this cab.
- I swear. - I swear.
On our first date, I ordered a Greek salad.
Lilly asked if she could have my olives.
- I said, "Sure. I hate olives." - But, you like olives.
Well, I was 18, okay ? I was a virgin.
Been waitin' my whole life for a pretty girl to want my olives.
Marshall, I'm gonna give you an early wedding present.
Don't get married.
I think I like your olive theory.
I think I like your new French horn.
I think I like your nose.
I think I'm in love with you.
What ?! What ?! What ?!
Come on, man, you said your stomach's been hurting, right ?
You know what that is.
Hunger.
You're hungry for experience.
Hungry for something new.
Hungry for olives.
But you're too scared to do anything about it.
Yeah, I'm scared, okay ?
But, when I think of spending the rest of my life with Lilly...
committing, forever, no other women...
doesn't scare me at all.
I'm marrying that girl.
Lilly.
Lilly, I like olives.
We'll make it work.
So, Orlando. You gonna hit Disneyworld ?
You love me ?!
Why did I say that ? Who says that ?
I should just go.
Hold on.
Wait a minute.
Promised you these.
Olives. Thanks. I love you.
What is wrong with me ?
Why are we still sitting here ?
Let's go. We can still make last call.
What do you say, Lil ?
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum ?
'Cause you're a pirate.
Okay, eye patch, gone.
And we can't just abandon Ted.
If it doesn't go well up there, he's gonna need some support.
It's been, like, 20 minutes.
You think they're doin' it ?
You think they're doin' it in front of the dogs ?
Doggy style.
Hey, there was a girl in college, she had this golden retriever...
Okay, we can go to the bar. Just stop talking.
Hit it, Ranjit.
So, when you tell this story to your friends,
could you avoid the word "psycho ?"
I'd prefer. "eccentric."
Good night... psycho.
Great.
Um, how do I get to the F train ?
Oh, um, two blocks that way and take a right.
You know what ?
I'm done being single.
I'm not good at it.
Look, obviously, you can't tell a woman you just met you love her.
But... it sucks that you can't.
I'll tell you something, though.
If a woman... not you, just some hypothetical woman...
were to bear with me through all this,
I think I'd make a damn good husband.
Because, that's the stuff I'd be good at,
stuff like making her laugh and being a good father.
And walking her five hypothetical dogs.
Being a good kisser.
Everyone thinks they're a good kisser.
Oh, I've got references.
Good night, Ted.
And I'm a good handshaker.
That's a pretty great handshake.
And that was it.
I'll probably never see her again.
What ?
That was the signal.
That long, lingering handshake ? You should have kissed her.
There's no such thing as "the signal."
But, yeah, that was the signal.
Signal.
Ah, Carl, thank you.
Something I gotta do.
By the way, you should have kissed her.
Carl ! You guys weren't there.
I am so turned on right now.
Guys, trust me.
I've seen the signal.
That was not the signal.
Yeah, Ted, we're not on you anymore.
- To my fiancée. - To the future.
To one hell of a night !
That was not the signal.
I asked her about it years later.
And, yeah, that was the signal.
I could have kissed her.
But that's the funny thing about destiny.
It happens whether you plan it or not.
I mean, I never thought I'd see that girl again,
but it turns out I was just too close to the puzzle
to see the picture that was forming.
Because, that, kids, is the true story of how I met your Aunt Robin.
Aunt Robin ?
I thought this was how you met mom !
Will you relax ? I'm getting to it.
Like I said, it's a long story.
- OLDER TED: Okay, where was I? - You were telling us how you met Mom.
- In excruciating detail. - Right.
So, back in 2005, when I was 27, my two best friends got engaged.
And it got me thinking, maybe I should get married,
And then I saw Robin, She was incredible,
I just knew I had to meet her, That's where your Uncle Barney came in,
I suggest we play a little game I like to call, "Have you met Ted?"
No, no, no, no, we're not playing "Have you met Ted."
Hi, have you met Ted?
So I asked her out, and I know this sounds crazy,
but after just one date I was in love with her,
which made me say something stupid,
I think I'm in love with you.
What?
- Oh, Dad. - So then what happened?
Nothing,
I mean, I'd made a complete fool of myself,
So, a week went by and I decided not to call her,
So, you're not gonna call her?
You went from "I think I'm in love with you"
to "I'm not gonna call her"?
I wasn't in love with her, okay?
I was briefly in love with the abstract concept of getting married.
It had absolutely nothing to do with Robin.
- Robin? - Hey.
Look who I ran into.
Since when do you guys know each other?
Oh, since about here.
Lily recognized me from the news...
- Hello, sailor. - They just got engaged.
Well, I should get back to the station. See you guys.
- Nice seeing you, Ted. - Yeah, you, too.
Thanks.
- Damn it! - What?
- I'm in love with her. - No.
As your sponsor, I will not let you relapse.
- You blew it. It's over. Move on. - I don't know.
I just have this feeling she's the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.
Lily, you squeaked?
She said something about me, didn't she? Come on, spill it, Red.
Fine.
So, what do we think of Ted?
Ted's something else.
Huh?
I'm gonna spin that as good.
Lots of guys are something, I'm something else.
He comes on a little strong.
But that's part of my charm.
- But that's part of his charm. - Oh, totally.
I mean, he's sweet, he's charming, he's just looking for something
a little bit more serious than I am.
I mean, the most I can handle right now is something casual.
- This just stays between us, right? - Are you kidding?
This flapper, Fort Knox.
Oops.
She wants casual?
Okay, I'll be casual.
I'm gonna be a mushroom cloud of casual.
You know why? 'Cause it's a game.
I wanted to skip to the end and do the whole happily-ever-after thing,
but you don't get there unless you play the game.
- So you gonna ask her out? - Yeah. No!
I can't ask her out, because if I ask her out I'm asking her out.
So how do I ask her out without asking her out?
Did you guys get high?
I got it. I don't ask her out.
I invite her to our party next Friday.
- We're having a party next Friday? - We are now.
Casual.
Yeah, 'cause nothing says "casual" like inviting a hundred people
over just to mack on one girl. Oh, and Lily, that's my leg.
You waited five minutes to tell me that?
- All right, so call her up. - No, calling's not casual.
I just got to bump into her somewhere.
Now, if only I knew her schedule, I could arrange a chance encounter.
That's great, Ted. You'll be the most casual stalker ever.
Now, ever since Marshall put that ring on her finger,
Lily had been, well, extra affectionate,
Baby, no.
I have a 25-page paper on constitutional law due Monday.
I've barely started.
Hey, I'm just sitting here wearing my ring.
My beautiful ring.
Kind of makes wearing other stuff seem wrong.
My shirt.
Kind of don't wanna wear my shirt anymore.
Or my underwear.
That's right. I'm not wearing any.
- No underwear? - Not even slightly.
Guys.
Boundaries.
- There she is. - Thanks, Bill,
I'm reporting from the Razzle Dazzle Supermarket
on 75th and Columbus...
75th and Columbus.
Game on!
...where four-year-old Leroy Ellenberg
has climbed inside a Grab-A-Prize machine and gotten stuck.
And all in the pursuit of a stuffed, purple giraffe.
For Metro News 1, I'm Robin Scherbatsky.
PRODUCER: We're clear. ROBIN: Thanks, Don.
Ted?
- Robin? Wow, what are the odds? - What are you doing here?
Oh, you know, just shopping for dip.
I love dip. No, I don't love dip. I like dip.
As a friend, you know.
So, hey, you reporting a news story or something?
Yeah, a kid stuck in a crane machine. How sweet of you to call it news.
Wow, kid in a crane machine.
You just had to have that toy, didn't you?
Couldn't play the game like everyone else.
You're all sweaty.
Cute kid.
You know, it's so funny I should run into you.
We're having a party next Friday if you feel like swinging by,
but, you know, whatever.
Oh, I'm going back home next weekend.
- It's too bad it's not tonight. - It is. It's tonight.
This Friday. Did I say next Friday? Yeah, sorry.
I guess I've been saying "next Friday" all week.
But, yeah, it's tonight. The party's tonight.
But, you know, whatever.
- Hello? - Hey, am I interrupting anything?
No, no, I'm just writing my paper, hitting the books.
Yeah, well, you and Lily might want to put some clothes on.
We're throwing a party in two hours. Okay, bye.
So, Gatsby, what are you gonna do when Robin shows up?
Okay, I got it all planned out.
She steps through the door, And where is Ted?
Not eagerly waiting by the door,
No, I'm across the room at my drafting table
showing some foxy young thing all my cool architecture stuff,
So, Robin strolls over, and I casually give her one of these,
"Hey, what's up?"
She says, "Hey, nice place, etcetera, etcetera,"
And then I say,
"Well, make yourself at home,"
And I casually return to my conversation,
Then, an hour later,
"Oh, you're still here?"
I say, like I don't really care but it's a nice surprise,
And then, very casually,
"Wanna see the roof?"
- The roof. - The roof.
I get her up to the roof and the roof takes care of the rest.
What's so special about the roof?
Oh, the moon, the stars, the shimmering skyline.
You can't not fall in love on that roof.
We do it up there sometimes.
- Solid plan, my little friends. - We're the same height.
But may I suggest one little modification?
BARNEY; That foxy young thing you were chatting up?
Take her up to the roof and have sex with her,
- Crazy, monkey-style... - That's not the plan.
It should be the plan, I mean, look at her, Ted, look at her,
- She's smoking, - Thank you.
- Yeah, - But she's not Robin.
Exactly.
Ted, let's rap.
Statistic.
At every New York party there's always a girl
who has no idea whose party she's at.
She knows no one you know and you will never see her again.
Do you see where I'm going, huh, with this?
Barney, I don't think so.
- Scoping, bip, scoping, bip. - Man, you're a dork.
Bip, bip, bip, bip. Target acquired!
And now it's time we play a little game I like to call,
- "Have you met Ted?" - Oh, come on, not this.
- Hi, have you met Ted? - No.
- Hi. - Hi.
- You know Marshall, Lily? - No.
- Do you know anyone at this party? - I work with Carlos.
Excuse me. Anyone know a Carlos?
- No. - No.
On a silver platter. Bon appétit,
I don't think so.
Your loss, her gain. Excuse me, can I show you the roof?
- It's magical up there. - Sure.
Wait, wait, wait. Hey, I got that roof reserved.
- Dude, Robin's not coming. - Hey, she's gonna show up.
She'll show up.
OLDER TED; She didn't show up,
At least, it was a great party.
I ate like four whole cans of dip.
You always know what to say, old friend.
- It's Robin. - Answer it.
No, no, no, not right away. I gotta seem casual.
- Hello? - I'm so sorry I missed your party.
- Who is this? Meredith? - Robin.
Oh, Robin.
Hey, yeah,
- I guess you never showed up, did you? - No, I got stuck at work.
But they finally got that kid out of the crane machine.
- Did he get to keep the purple giraffe? - Yeah, they let him keep all the toys.
He was in there a long time and little kids have small bladders.
I wish your party was tonight.
It is. The party's tonight.
Yeah, it's a two-day party, 'cause that's just how we roll.
So if you wanna swing by, you know, it's casual.
See you.
- So that was Robin. - What are you doing to me, man?
- I got a paper to write. - I know, I'm sorry. It's terrible.
- I'll buy more dip. - Ted, Ted, wait!
Get French Onion!
Can you believe this guy? I got a paper to write.
Okay, fine. But it's gotta be, like, super quick.
- And no cuddling after. - I'm the luckiest girl alive.
Oh, you were so right about the roof.
That girl from last night, I took her back to my place,
then this morning took her outside, spun her around a couple times
and sent her walking.
She will never find her way back and there she is.
- How did she get here? Did you invite her? - I have no idea who that is.
She said she works with Carlos. Who's Carlos?
I don't know any Carlos.
- Hi, you. You're back. - I sure am.
- Come on, sweetie, I need a drink. - Sweetie. Really?
Help.
Whoa, whoa, rabbits.
Come on, I got that roof reserved.
All right.
So, it's over between me and Works with Carlos Girl.
- Oh, that was fast. - Yeah.
I was trying to think, what's the quickest way
to get rid of a girl you just met?
- I think I'm in love with you. - What?
- Thanks, bro. - Glad I could help.
What the... No, no, no, no, come on.
Sorry, Ted.
Great. What am I gonna do when Robin shows up?
She'll show up.
OLDER TED; She didn't show up,
All right, we threw two parties, everybody had fun,
everybody Wang-ed, everybody Chung-ed.
Now the kid has got to get to work. And the kid is not to be disturbed.
Repeat after me, "I will not have sex with Marshall."
- I will not have sex with Marshall. - I will not have sex with Marshall.
It's Robin.
- Hello? - Hi, Ted.
Amanda? Oh, Denise, sorry. You totally sounded like Amanda.
- It's Robin. - Oh, Robin.
- Hi. - I totally wanted to come,
I got stuck at work again. I feel like I live there.
Sorry I missed your party, again.
Hey, ain't no thing, but a chicken wing, mamacita,
Who am I?
I guess there's no chance your two-dayer turned into a three-dayer?
It did indeed. The party continues tonight.
Yeah, last night people were, like,
"Keep it going, bro! Party trifecta!"
Wow, okay. Well, I'll be there.
Great. See you tonight.
So that was Robin.
OLDER TED; So I threw a third party for Robin, on a Sunday night,
Oh, this is lame.
Lame or casual?
- Lame. - Or casual?
Hey, law books. Ready for a little 15-minute recess?
Sorry, baby, I gotta work. I need all my blood up here.
Has anybody seen An Introduction to Contract, Tort
and Restitution Statutes from 1865 to 1923?
- Anybody seen a big-ass book? - No.
WOMAN: Hello, Barney.
Of course.
You look well.
Is it weird they invited both of us?
Who?
Who invited you? No one even knows who you are.
I understand you're hurt, but you don't have to be cruel.
Carlos was right about you.
Who is Carlos?
Hey, where the hell is my...
Oh!
Okay.
An Introduction to Contract, Tort and Restitution Statutes
from 1865 to 1923
is not a coaster!
Ted, I'm jeopardizing my law career so you can throw not one,
not two, but three parties for some girl that you just met
who's probably not even gonna show up!
I mean, where is she, Ted, huh? Where's Robin?
Hi. Hi, Robin.
So, you threw all these parties for me?
No. Oh, you thought that... No.
Okay, yes. You got me.
One of the reasons I threw these parties was so that I could introduce you
to this guy.
I figured, you know, since it didn't work out between us
and now we can just laugh about it.
- Well, anyway, Robin, this is... - Carlos.
She's still talking to Carlos.
I can still win this. It's not over.
Okay, buddy, time for the tough talk.
Robin seems great, but let's look at the facts.
You want to get married
and right now there's a million women in New York looking for exactly you.
But Robin ain't one of them.
She's not just one of them. She's the one.
Yeah well, "the one" is heading up to the roof.
What are you gonna do?
Nothing. It's a game. I gotta just
keep playing it.
ROBIN: Hey. TED: Hey.
- Carlos, can you give us a minute? - Hey, no sweat, hombre,
See you.
Robin, look, I didn't throw this party to set you up with Carlos
or the one before that, or the one before that.
I threw these parties because I wanted to see you.
Well, here I am.
There's something here. Look, unless I'm crazy.
You're not crazy.
I don't know, Ted. I mean, we barely know each other
and you're looking at me with that look and it's like...
- What, like what? - It's like, "Let's fall in love,
"and get married and have kids and drive them to soccer practice."
I'm not gonna force sports on them unless they're interested.
It's a great look, but you're looking at the wrong girl.
- No, I'm not. - Yes, you are.
I don't want to get married right now, maybe ever.
And if we go out together, I'd feel like
I'd either have to marry you or break your heart
and I just couldn't do either of those things.
Just like you can't turn off the way you feel.
Click.
Off. Let's make out.
What?
What? That was the off switch and I turned it off.
I mean, look, sure, yes, I wanna
fall in love, get married, blah, blah, blah. But, on the other hand,
you, me,
the roof.
- There's no off switch. - There is an off switch.
And it's off.
No, it's not.
Yes, it is.
- No, it's not. - Yes,
it is.
Oh.
No, it's not.
You're right. There's no off switch.
- God, I wish there was an off switch. - Me, too.
So...
What do we do now?
We could be friends.
Look, I know it sounds insincere when people say that
but we could.
I don't know, Robin.
I made such a jackass of myself here,
we start hanging out, every time I see you, it'll be like,
"Oh, that's right, I'm a jackass."
You're not a jackass.
Look, I'm sorry. I only moved here in April, and I'm always working.
And I just haven't met a lot of good people so far.
But I understand.
Well,
maybe in a few months after it's not so fresh we could all,
you know, get a beer.
Yeah. That sounds good.
I'll see you, Ted.
Or, you know, now.
We could all get a beer now.
I'd like that.
My friends are gonna love you, like you, you know as a friend.
Jackass.
Unbelievable.
That's just a recipe for disaster. They work together.
- You jealous? - Oh, please.
- What does Carlos have that I don't? - A date tonight?
Stop the tape. Rewind, play it again.
A date tonight?
I'm not sure I like her.
Hey, don't you have a paper to write?
- Dude, you're talking to the kid. - I know it.
I'm gonna knock back this beer, I'm gonna knock back one more beer,
I'm gonna go home, I'm gonna write a 25-page paper,
I'm gonna hand it in and I'm gonna get a "A."
My name is Rufus and that's the Troofus.
OLDER TED; He got a B-minus,
But, still, 25 pages in one night, B-minus? The kid was good,
At least, let me buy you a beer. Come on, I'll buy everyone a beer.
I'll help carry.
- You know something, Ted? - What?
You are a catch. You're gonna make some girl very happy.
And I am going to help you find her.
Well, good luck.
I mean, maybe, New York is just too big a town.
I mean, there's millions of people in this city.
How, in all this mess, is a guy supposed to find the love of his life?
I mean, where do you even begin?
Hi, have you met Ted?
Hey. You know the 5th grade starts tomorrow again.
What?! Does that mean we have to get up at 8:00?
Oh, calm down.
- You slept 95% of the summer. - Yeah.
- What about Summer? - Yeah, she's nice.
Uh, vomit.
- Summer, where's Mommy? - I'll put you to bed tonight, Kayla.
We're getting older. Mom'll be gone someday.
It's 5th grade. Time to be a grown-up.
- Where did she... - I won't drink coffee or like boys.
- I'll fill my own water bottle, get bangs. - Is she still gonna...
Everyone got bangs, but my forehead's getting bigger.
I don't wanna look like a parade float or an alien and be the talk...
Way to be strong, Dad.
Going to Westlake next year?
My cousin said there's a kid who smokes there.
- You see anything? - No. A lot of yappin'. Come on.
- Ah, there we go. - All right.
Another year, another batch of 5th grade head cases.
Kabir, Anthony, welcome.
You from New York, new guy? Patriots suck!
That's New England.
- I think your shirt's on backwards. - Come on!
- Look at this. Bunch of motormouths. - Yep. Same old, same old.
I saw Cara in a sweater from Gymboree.
- There's the snotty clique. - Tween Queens.
- The Facade Squad. - Peaking at 11.
- The "sick and should've stayed home" kid. - Always one.
There's the class clown who secretly despises himself.
That's hysterical, Cole!
- Thanks, Cole! - Jeez, how many Coles this year?
Reminds me of the Justin avalanche of 1991.
God forbid we ever see a Richie again.
Bro, no way, are you taller than me now?
The inevitable Cheez Doodle kid.
No, those look like Dorito fingers.
- We just moved from the Bronx. - You're new? Wow.
That's hard. Never had to leave friends, except when we went to Myrtle Beach.
On the flight home, the old lady next to me had arthritis.
I opened her mustard packet.
- First child. - No filter.
Never heard the word "enough."
Okay, guys. Are you excited?
Most of you have been going to this school for five years.
Some of you, seven. And now you're the big kids.
I hope everyone's met our class pets, Leonardo and Squirtle.
I'm not touching those things.
Don't they eat, sleep and poo in the same place?
Hey! I poo where he sleeps.
Now what if I told you
there's a big reward at the end of this year if you do well in class?
The Academicathalon thing?
Look at her work these kids. Salinas, what a pro.
Best since Ms. Bielecky in the '60s.
And what if I told you this year's winning class
gets a field trip to somewhere special for a whole day?
Yeah!
- Salinas havin' a baby? - The belly's poppin' a little.
Oh, Zane, I'm afraid you can't bring snacks into the class.
I'll hold those, just for now.
Cheetos. Wow, didn't see that coming.
At the end of the year, our three 5th grade classes
compete in art, debating, science, and history.
And if our class wins, we get a trip to Magic Land Park!
Don't they have the Dragon Coaster? I heard it caught fire once!
- Yeah, it was banned in Europe. - Yes, but not in Florida.
Yep, havin' a baby.
Okay. Let's see how much you guys already know.
Who knows what you call it when a plant…
…converts light to food?
- The conversion's photosynthesis… - Photosynthesis.
- …turning H2O and CO2 into glucose. - Into glucose.
- Ah. - Excellent job, Mia.
Oh. So…
Oh, boy. Divorced parents.
Okay, honey. Thank you.
You're okay. So sweet.
Okay.
Let's look at some of the books we're gonna read in class this year.
Who's heard of Charlotte's Web?
Oh no. The kids always cry at the end.
Like kids don't cry enough? We gotta trigger the garden hoses?
- Crying's for weaklings. - Right.
We'll meet Fern and her pig, Wilbur.
It's a stupid book anyway.
- Right. Animals never talk to people. - Plus, no one gets to eat Charlotte.
You just have to hear about this delicious spider for days
and get hungry thinkin' about it.
…like you'll learn this year.
Sorry, Cole? Is there something you wanna share?
That's so gross!
I can't believe you did that!
Sorry, guys.
Man, that smells good.
Send some of that our way next time. Gettin' sick of the lettuce.
Hi, Mrs. Salinas!
- Hi, I'm Cole Wiseki's mom. - Oh, hi.
Can I... Real quick? For Facebook?
Thanks.
- Cole is a very... - That's gonna look great. Thank you.
Since when do people wanna look like ducks?
Isn't that something, how they've grown?
And in 5th grade, you'll find your kids wanting to make their own choices.
Embrace it. Let them make their own mistakes.
How long does this go?
Not terribly long, Dr. Wenger.
Now, some of you may have heard about Mrs. Salinas', uh,
incident in class.
I want to confirm it has nothing to do with anything she ate in the cafeteria.
She's just gonna be taking some time off. A leave, let's say.
Wait. For how long?
Here comes the bomb.
For, uh… Till she has the baby, let's say.
- What?! - Having a baby?
Are you sure? Did she get a second opinion?
Are you kidding me? This is what happened in 3rd grade!
The substitute was awful!
I'm texting my daughter right now! She'll be devastated!
You can't just say that!
Look at these lazy class pets. Do they even move?
- I'd like that job. - That lizard looks pretty old.
Do I look old?
Thank you.
It's a Tuatara. They live a long time. Till about 75.
Hmm. Never knew that. Suck on that, hamsters.
Wow. Looks like he's gettin' close to that.
Bye. Nice seeing you.
Ah, he's nuts.
I mean, you're old, cranky, lazy, but no way does that make you 75.
Seventy-five. Seventy-five. Seventy-five.
Underneath it says,
"Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon."
We came in peace...
1949.
- What about it? - I was born around then.
How many years has it been since 1949?
No idea. That's addition.
They learn that in 2nd grade. We're all about fractions.
Great. Why can't they move us around a little, so we can know more?
Okay, four sixteenths equals how many fourths?
- She's leaving. They don't hear a word. - 1966, 1967…
- What're you doin'? - Trying to count how many years old I am.
1968, 1969, 1970…
I'm out of toes and fingers. What else can I count with?
I'd tell you, but there's kids around.
I was talkin' about his tail.
Addition… I… I gotta talk to some 2nd grade pets.
Forget it. We only see those pets at fire drills .
They don't happen until November.
What the...
- Huh? What? - Is this a fire drill?
It's probably nothing, but let's go. Anthony, why don't you grab the pets?
Everyone evacuate! Stop, drop and roll!
I think I'm on fire!
Jeez, we just redecorated!
Someday, cops are gonna carry that kid off a plane. Huh?
I'll park ya right over here, fellas.
All right, here we go.
Hey, guys, how was your summer? Do anything fun?
- Sleep. - Sleep.
- Eat. - Lot of poopin'.
Terrific. Say, who's 2nd grade again?
- That's me. How ya doin', Lizzy? - Great.
I'm actually Leonardo. Lizzy's the iguana in Mr. Marculia's homeroom. You're…
I'm Cinnabun. I know. So corny. Just got renamed again.
Oh. Well, beats "Thumper."
I guess. What's bad are the Hare ones. Hare Brain, Hare Piece, Hare-y Potter…
Right, right. Hey, the 2nd graders, you guys do addition, right?
…Hare Lip, Hare Club For Men.
Yes, and subtraction. We do both.
Great, okay, look. If I got here in 1949,
and it's 2023, what does that make me?
Oh. Uh, I know this one. A reptile.
Shmuck.
Okay, it was a false alarm.
The school is not on fire.
No, how old would I be?
No. Right, subtraction. Okay, um, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, 74.
- Seventy-four. Isn't that right before... - Upsy-daisies.
Wait, wait! Hold on!
That's the number before 75, isn't it?
What's the matter? You look upset.
Cinnabun!
Settle down.
I'm a lizard. Ooh.
That's good. Don't dignify it.
Doesn't matter. I'm doomed.
I'm 74 seventy-fifths dead.
What? That's not for class pets.
When you're in captivity, 75 is the new 70.
And, hey, you wanna live so bad, a little exercise wouldn't kill ya.
- Like what? - Blinking's good. That'd be a start.
- I blink. - Barely.
Fine.
Okay. You didn't have to dive right in.
Who am I kiddin'?
I can't start this rigorous workin' out at this point in my life.
It's too late. I blew it.
I wasted my life!
And now, it's almost over.
Go about your business.
Everyone, meet your new teacher.
This is our substitute?
You have to leave? So soon?
Well, my doctor thinks I need to rest through my pregnancy.
So until I'm back, you'll have Ms. Malkin.
It's not brain surgery, gang.
Guys, you don't have to be afraid of change.
Change is a beautiful part of life.
- Oh, I don't sing. - Oh, okay.
How about we continue with the class. I'm gonna teach with Ms. Malkin today...
- Please don't leave us, Mrs. Salinas! - Oh.
Agh! Down! Now! Down!
No hug! Sit!
In class, we sit up straight, pay attention, and we are what? You!
What? Oh, my God. Um, we're quiet?
That's very good listening, Logan. That's a heart for you.
The hearts are for when the kids listen. To motivate good...
Listening is not a favor.
When you listen, you get knowledge, not a carnival prize.
We have a chance to go to Magic...
Ew. What was that?
Peanut butter and ham. My dad overslept.
Okay, well, we're out of time, so let's wish Mrs. Salinas well. Bye-bye.
- But, I... The class is... - No, no. I know. Out we go.
- Better luck with your own kid. - Okay, guys, see you in...
Moving on. It's Friday. That means one student has to take home a class pet.
- What's this now? - Uh, we don't do that here.
Not anymore. No way.
In my classroom, you will learn responsibility.
You will feed it properly and return it in healthy condition.
Alive.
Do we have a volunteer?
- Come on. Somebody raise your hand. - What?
Remember what happens at the kids' houses? They forget to feed you or abuse you.
It'll grow back.
- Yeesh. - Hey, it looked cool in the '90s.
I'm waiting. Volunteer, please.
Don't you get it? This is my shot.
So I go with one of these kids, case the house for open windows,
then when I'm alone, zip! I escape.
- Ha. You couldn't zip when you were 20. - I'm zipping. And then I really live.
Maybe climb a tree. Swim in a sewer. See the Everglades.
The Everglades? With those untamed animals? Are you nuts?
You know they don't even have names, right? It's anarchy.
You think a rock potato like you can survive there?
- Your last days will be in a beer can. - Let's go.
Who's gonna take on some responsibility?
- Or do I have to pick? - Well, if no one else will…
I don't want them to feel not wanted. Everybody wants to fit in
and shouldn't be judged on looks, species, foreheads.
I have to go indoor skydiving tomorrow,
but my father'll be home, so if it's okay to...
- Pick one! - Okay, the lizard!
Listen, when you're out there in the wild and those animals come after you,
remember to change your colors and blend in!
- That's chameleons. I'm not a chameleon. - Oh, well, then you're a dead man.
Tomorrow's indoor skydiving. We have to get ready.
It's exactly like skydiving, except you can't get hurt.
Okay, we have a busy weekend.
Do I have to wear a dress to Grandma's? It'll be pants weather on Sunday.
Jayda said the word "puke". She said it wasn’t a curse word. Is it?
I feel bad leaving him. Nobody wants him near the dinner table.
He's good with his water. Back soon!
Kayla, don't look scared of him. That's being mean.
It's on.
Yeah.
He's nice, the new kid Kabir, but he doesn't talk a lot,
at least not with me. Maybe he's shy since…
Then I burned my tongue. It didn't, like, burn off completely,
or I couldn't tell you how I ate my mozzarella sticks.
Hey, Leonardo. You missed a great movie. Tomorrow I'll take you down for breakfast.
I hope they have everything bagels left. I don't know why we get sesame bagels.
Mom asked me to try one, I was like, "Why would you take off the poppy seeds
and the salt…"
Wait, where are you?
This is a nightmare! I'll be the kid who killed the lizard,
no matter what I do in my life.
Whether I do drama, be a doctor... I'll never be a doctor now.
I could work at the DMV. Hopefully, the one next to Quiznos.
I don't wanna go far from my parents.
Mother of Godzilla!
What was that?
Well? Who said that?
The wall? Walls don't talk. Why would a wall say anything?
Why point to it? They say, "If these walls could talk,"
because they can't talk...
The trophy!
You said something! You just spoke! Mom!
- No! - You talked!
You're talking!
I'm telling Mom, or people will think I'm crazy.
I'll have to go to that school in Tampa for kids with issues! I...
But please, people can't know!
- Why are your hands wet? - They're naturally moist.
Please, I'm begging you to keep quiet.
If people know I talk,
they'll send me to a scientist or something.
- But I have to tell someone. - Please.
You're the only one who can hear me.
Oh. Then why are you whispering?
Because you were, and it sounded fun.
Do all lizards talk?
I don't know. I never met them all, but we never talk to humans.
- Why are you talking to me? - Well, I didn't…
Because I want to. I think you're nice.
Really? Thanks.
I don't know if people think I'm nice. It's so hard to read people at school.
People say you're nice to be nice,
and if they say you're nice, you'll think they're cool...
I get it.
You say "I get it" a lot.
That's 'cause I understand things. That's all. "I get it." I've been around.
- Okay. I thought it was something else. - Like what?
- That you want me to stop talking. - Oh. Wow.
Really? Like, "Wow, that's crazy"?
No, more like, "Wow, I didn't think you were that self-aware."
I can tell. People are too nice to say I talk too much,
but I can tell from their faces that I'm talking too much.
Like, old people make this face. And babies kind of look sleepy.
And the bus driver's face is like, "Stop." But I can't stop and I…
Sorry, I'm listening. Please, go ahead.
I've seen a lot of kids who talk a lot. They seem...
Right. This is normal. A bunch of kids...
I said, "I get it!"
I know I said "I get it" again. I'm sorry.
It's just that last one wasn't even a rhyme, it was a repeat.
They don't really like...
Ask a question?
Wow. It's not like I don't care about the other kids...
I know. It's great you're good at talking about yourself.
When people share stuff, they feel better.
So if you get other kids talking about themselves,
they'll like being with you. More than they do already, I mean.
Five-second rule.
Well, that was really nice. Thank you.
Oh, yeah. Glad to do it.
Hey, remember, you can't tell anyone, ever.
Or we won't be able to talk again.
Okay. So I'm your special, secret friend? That was a question.
Uh, yeah. Sure. And good question.
- Thanks, Leonardo. - Call me Leo. Less Ninja Turtley.
Summer. You need to get to bed, sweetie.
Mom, what's the square root of 91?
What? Please just get to bed.
I don't mean just any question.
Okay. Right. Got it.
Find your new seats.
Oh, back already? You saw the whole world in one weekend?
Wow. Hey, how were the Everglades? How high was the Eiffel Tower?
- What was the Pope like? - Could you not do that on my pillow?
Put those computers away. We will not be studying our curriculum on toys.
Russian judge.
Slow down. No running.
No eating the books!
Oh, Coach Kimura.
Oh, I apologize. Let me… Let me clean that for you.
There we go.
This is so unfair. Ugh! She'll work us till we have no energy.
Then we'll only get into schools with drug problems.
Forget about winning the trip. This is a nightmare.
It's worse than when I lost my phone.
Worse than when my dad wore bike shorts.
Worse than when I got lost on a plane, which is hard to do, but really scary.
Like a horror movie, though my parents won't let me watch them,
unless you count the furnace in Toy Story 3 , but that...
Oh. What should we do about it, Jayda?
I'm totally telling my parents about it. My dad has a lot of pull,
because he gives the teachers free zit cream,
but you should tell yours too.
Why are you talking to Summer?
- I like her now. - Uh, I know. I do too.
- What was that all about? - She likes me. She thought I was fun.
You fun? What'd you do, turn your head more than once?
Oh, what a showman.
Get all your mean jokes in now,
'cause the next kid who takes me home is the last kid.
Sure they are, Mr. Chicken-to-leave.
Whatever you say, Mr. Wants-to-get-bitten.
Oh, I'm shaking, Mr. Almost-as-brave-as-Scooby Doo.
Duck, duck, duck, goose!
Ow! Okay. Okay. All right! That's not the game. Kids!
…the Stamp Act. Eyes up here! For those of you who did the reading…
- Salinas never taught this stuff. - Yeah. What's a stamp?
…the first tax levied directly
on American colonists by the British Parliament.
Skyler, what did I just say?
Answer! How did the colonists react?
Demerits!
You do not want demerits.
- What's a demerit? - I think he played for the Clippers.
You're going to leave 5th grade with discipline,
or you are never going to leave 5th grade.
Who has the discipline to take a class pet home this weekend?
I'll do it. I'll take Leo again.
"Leo"?
Again? Who would want it twice?
Not one of you is man enough for middle school, are you?
Ugh. Not now. I'll take the lizard.
Oh, you'll have so much fun with Leo, Eli. You think, maybe, I can visit?
Really? That'd be great. Zane's coming, but we can all hang...
You kids having a fun play date?
Sure.
Sorry about those chips, Zaney. Can't be too careful.
Have a kale cupcake.
Do I have to wear the safety suit all weekend?
Lizards carry disease, honey.
Kids and dogs are especially vulnerable.
Um, I think my mom wants to pick me up.
- Thank you, Julie! - They had the best time.
Could you go cut his chicken into non-chokeable pieces?
Hey.
What? It'll grow back.
You're dressed like a 1950s astronaut and I'm the weird one?
Oh, now you're threatening me, Doodlepoo? Do that...
What?
- What... - Dinnertime, Eli!
Eli, now! You need three hours to digest your food before bed.
This is totally crazy. You talk?
Just to you.
- 'Cause, uh… - I'm special?
Uh, yeah, that's right.
Oh. Okay.
But you can't tell anyone. They'll try to kill me like E.T.
But my parents told me when someone says, "Don't tell anyone,"
that's when I have to tell.
Well, your parents are right, but that's with strange humans.
I'm just a strange lizard. Okay?
- Please don't tell. Especially him. - The drone?
No way. You saw what it did to the Cheetos out there.
I mean, it's nice that it's loyal.
Come on. When I was six, kids thought it was cool.
- Maybe you should say something about it. - I don't want to hurt its feelings.
I know a way. I've seen kids break up over the years.
You write down why you're dumping them,
and it gives the other person time to soak it in and not snap.
It's a "Dear Drone" letter.
Get a pen and paper.
He's just doing it for show. See?
He knows he's recyclable.
Let's just give him some space.
Nobody's ever gonna like me like he does.
Kid, they don't even know you. Now you can finally show your stuff.
Uh, I don't have any stuff.
Ah, you just gotta find your gimmick.
There was a boy in 1998, Mike Djokovic.
He memorized all the words to "Walkin' on the Sun."
Smash Mouth? No? Look, it's got a lot of words.
The point is, plenty of kids have a gimmick.
It's okay. I got a few.
- Uh, get me a caterpillar. - For real?
Trust me.
Oh, that's perfect.
Okay, here we go.
So gross!
Wait.
What the...
Here, let me show you something.
Eli, where's your safety suit?
Try doing this.
Very good.
Fore!
- You nailed that thing. - What was it? A possum?
I don't know, but you hit it in the jellybeans.
Wanna quit and go home? Can't top that.
Not everyone's invited.
Yes, I'm back.
Where's your tail? You escaping one limb at a time?
Just give me some space. I got hit in the jellybeans.
I forgot that was there.
Salinas was teacher of the year! That substitute lady's unacceptable.
Do the skin cream samples I give out mean nothing to you people?
How do I get that horrible woman replaced?
Dr. Wenger, please. She's sitting right here.
- So? - Jay, it's not polite.
Fine.
May I speak about you as if you're not here?
Listen, my kid was on track to get into Westlake next year,
Langley Prep in three years, Dartmouth in seven years,
then a moderately happy marriage in 14 years.
I paid for that smart board and this light switch.
If I'm letting you keep this animal as her teacher,
you're gonna do something for me to fix this.
Four seconds. Three, two, one.
Pencils down.
Except Jayda,
who will now be getting two more minutes
due to her permanent jet lag.
Quiet. No discussion.
Now, one of you has to take home a class pet.
Volunteer or be assigned.
I'll take Leo again.
- What is the deal? Leo? Again? - You can't take a pet twice, right?
Because I would... I mean, why do you want him again?
Um, 'cause he was awesome.
- Why do you want him? - Uh, same reason. Awesome.
Wait. If it's awesome, I want it.
It's supposed to say, "Dr. Skin,"
not "Dr. Skid."
S-K-I-N. No D's.
Jayda, I dyed the cat green.
So unoriginal.
Isn't that great, what I got for you?
- Drake's coming to my party? - Eh, I'm still on it.
I meant the pop quiz, the two more minutes.
- Who takes care of you? - What did Daddy do?
Well, Benji, Jayda's substitute teacher is a horror show…
Making the kids read big books.
No!
So Daddy got Jayda something no other kid gets.
What, Daddy?
Should we put the lizard in my room? The birthday party's coming up...
Not now. Daddy's bragging.
Ugh. It's like the worst day of my life. Nobody's focusing on my party.
It's going to totally suck, and the other kids will be happy about it.
What? Why would they be happy?
Because they're all jealous. Wait. What? Who said that?
That was me.
- Oh my God! You talk? - No, it's not safe.
- You're the only one who can hear me. - So awesome! We have a talking lizard!
- I can only talk to you! - Oh my God! Daddy!
Uh, sure.
That makes sense. But can you do tricks at the party?
Can you rap and play the piano with your tongue?
Nah, this is just between us. I'm talking to you to give advice.
- I don't need advice. I'm awesome. - Nah, you're miserable.
Wait, what?
Just like Emma Lawrence in '03, Nina Myers in '55,
all pretty, all rich, all bright.
- So? - Not done.
All snotty, all secretly hated.
- People were jealous. - Not of the snottiness.
Look, people don't realize the pressure someone like me is under.
My family is so amazing, so I have a lot more to live up to.
I have to get into the best middle school and have the best party
and, yeah, only the best people around me.
No, you don't.
Ugh, you don't get what being awesome's like.
But you're not.
I'm what?
Brace yourself.
A middleweight?
Great?
You're great, but no one's that great.
We're all just people and lizards.
There you go.
Bravo.
- Thank you. Great job, guys. - Thanks.
- Honey, maybe you wanna tip them? - What? The watches?
- Guys, you want some water? Anybody? - No, that's okay.
- Okay. Well, thank you. - Yep. Thanks, Mr. Skin.
- It's "doctor." "Dr. Skin." - Uh-huh.
Mom, Dad, do we have any more invitations?
More? I thought we excluded everyone you wanted.
Yeah, but we made a bigger list.
- Hi, guys. I'm so glad you came. - Thanks for inviting us.
Of course. How are you?
Uh, wait. I know this one. We're fine.
That thing sounded like Cole.
Wow. Zane is funny now?
Zane was always funny.
Like in 2nd grade,
when he told Mrs. Lemos that Superman came from planet Crouton?
- Hey. You kids try the bubble guy yet? - Dad, we'll get to the bubbles.
This guy's next level. He makes bubble animals.
Here you go. Next. You're not holding it right!
Jayda burgers. Jayda taters.
Jayda vegetables.
Please don't do this.
What're you looking at, boss?
Got a problem with compact legs?
What?
You think you got it so great out there? What do you do in the box?
Uh, I molt.
Occasional blinking.
All right. I'm sorry, brother. We're fighting the same fight.
I mean, the only fun I've ever had was biting some of that guy's fingers off.
I've asked you five times to jump through this hoop.
I'm just, uh… I'm getting old, you know?
Ever feel like time's running out, and this is all we're ever gonna know?
Were you just talking to that horse? Is he having a good time?
I gotta tell you,
the truth is, no animal wants to be locked inside...
Hey, Jayda. Hey, Leo. I can't believe how much cool…
Uh, I mean, hey, just Jayda, are you having a good time?
Thanks for asking me. My parents never ask.
They just assume I'm having a good time,
'cause they still don't realize they aren't that great.
- What would make you have a better time? - Good question.
- Okay. Standard magnetic lock. - Circuits are cross-current.
- Jumper cables. Balloon. - Right here.
This is so fun!
I specifically said "no mayhem!"
- Thanks, PJ. - Uh, TJ.
- Oh, I'm sorry. - It's cool. Jacked about the eye contact.
Stop that stopwatch. He's got my wallet.
You made it happen, boss. Greatest day ever.
- Hey, hey, hey. - Leo! Where's Leo?
- Did someone take him? - Please, somebody find him. Leo!
Leo! Leo! Leo!
You're not holding it right!
- Leo! Leo! - Where is he?
Leo!
Leo!
You guys are really into that lizard.
He's just awesome.
Cheese!
- I had so much fun at the party. - Did you get a bubble animal?
Camel went on the waterslide.
- Again? Whatever happened to zipping? - Oh, you'll know when I zip.
I'll be in the Everglades dining on maggots
you can only dream about.
You were fun, Leo. I'll miss you.
If Santa Claus has 39 elves
making 1,981 toys an hour…
Freezing here. How about giving a guy some shell?
Wait. Ho, ho, Mr. Popular, now you wanna come in here with me?
It's 65 degrees.
These Central Florida winters are brutal.
Just a couple of minutes.
Hey, hey! At least buy me dinner first.
Wait. Are those my baseball cards?
Call me.
You're talking to them.
- That's why you keep coming back. - What? No.
Just a little bit.
No, no, no, no. There is no little bit. We don't talk to them.
These kids are all benefiting from my insights before I drop dead.
- Okay, so it's about your ego. - That's not what this is.
It's about sharing my 74 years of wisdom to help these kids with their issues.
Whether it's breaking up with the drone or having hand-me-down pants.
Oh, boo-freakin'-hoo.
I had to wear my sister's shell till I was 16.
I made a huge difference with that TJ kid.
What? I don't understand. That's normal.
First one? Usually, it's in the front, but very nice. You're growing up.
No, no, no. It's my dad.
What's so funny? I told him that Dave Connaire,
in 1974, all of a sudden, grew a nose the size of a Buick just like his dad's.
And everybody still loved him, 'cause he was a cool kid, like you.
And the next week, Cole's problem was even tougher.
You won't do sleepovers, 'cause you say things in your sleep?
Well, if I'm not gonna tell anyone about you talking to me,
do you promise not to tell anyone?
Yeah. Of course.
This isn't my real voice.
I really talk like this. I can't let them know. I sound ridiculous.
This is priceless.
Well, I fixed it. I told him…
- You sound like a young Bee Gee. - A what?
How 'bout The Weeknd? Know him?
Yeah, like that.
Last week, he sang at the winter recital ,
and I heard they went nuts.
Nice job, Ms. Malkin.
I'm sorry, was that praise?
Keep it up , and we may see more of you here.
- The class did great. - Did they win?
Nah, kindergarten always wins. Way too cute.
And you should've seen me last week with Mia.
You mean Huggy? The human cling wrap?
Excuse me. She has a name.
As you know, her parents were recently divorced.
Only two hours late today. Very considerate.
Are you letting him cut his own hair now?
You can't watch the kids next weekend, so me and Aurora can have
Valentine's Day together? I'm asking you one favor!
You don't have any plans. Because I know.
I'm sorry, but lizards do not talk.
Parrots, macaws, songbirds, and certain killer whales.
Don't believe everything you read on the Internet.
Why would you only talk to me?
'Cause you're nice. You're great at school, answering all the questions.
- I love to learn things. - You're a lot quieter around your family.
Don't you ever wanna let 'em see how big that brain of yours is?
My brother and sister think I'm weird.
Really?
- You just looked like my grandpa. - Yeah? Is that a good thing?
My grandpa used to talk to me.
He really liked science, and he would ask me questions,
even if he knew the answer.
What? He sounds like a great guy.
He was my best friend.
Oh, no, no, no, no. I didn't mean to get that going.
Please, kid, I hate that.
- I'm sorry. - Oh, no, no. Don't be sorry.
Just stop. I… I can't handle it.
But my mom says it's good to cry.
Not where I come from. Here. Let me calm you down.
I'll sing you a lullaby, and you'll go to sleep.
Whoa. You scared me.
You're just doing what my grandpa did,
pretending not to know something, so I can tell you what's right.
Here. Scientific research has established
that crying releases oxytocin and endorphins.
These feel-good chemicals help ease both physical and emotional pain.
I didn't know how to help her, so I just listened. And that helped.
Wow. So you got this E.T. scam going.
Got every kid thinking he's Elliott? This will end badly.
All I know is these kids'll remember me.
Did you hear about Hammy #3's funeral last week?
- Hammy #3 died? Didn't know that. - Exactly.
They say the funeral was a snooze. No one had anything to say.
I liked that white spot over his ear.
I liked the way he breathed.
He gave me pinkeye.
My funeral is gonna be packed with fond remembrances and anecdotes.
Yeah, good for you and your last week's vocabulary words.
And, buddy, that funeral could come sooner than you think.
- Me! Me! - My turn with the Geico thing!
Have fun, Anthony! Leo's awesome!
These things heads grow back too? Or just their tails? I'll figure it out.
Oh, no. Call my next of kin. This is how I want to divide my estate.
Help me!
- What? - I got your back.
- I couldn't let you do this one alone. - What are you gonna do?
You lay back. It's harder to hurt me. I got the shell.
What about giving advice?
Oh, like I don't know anything? I can do what you do.
That was an incredible move! What strategy!
- Hey! - …Starting to let his…
Go straight to his head.
Hey, over here.
- What? - Ah!
- Oh, come on! - Forget that. I talk.
Oh my God. Grandma!
No, no, no. Stop, stop. Can't do that or we'll all die.
- What? Why? - I don't know. I… I'm telling you.
- You… You'll die. Just shut up. Calm down. - Oh, okay.
Fix your phone later. I'm a talking turtle. I picked you 'cause…
"I like your style."
- Take it down a notch. - I got this. Now, tell me your problems.
- What? - I… I can fix your problems. I… I… I…
I seen a lot of things in that 5th grade room,
and I can help. So come on.
I don't have any problems. Other than I broke my phone.
Ah-ha. Bully. I get it.
Come on. You're insecure, right? Every class bully is.
No. I don't know.
You're sad, you got something tearing you up inside.
Just say it. I'm a talking turtle. I can't tell anyone else.
Of course I'm a bully. I don't know what else to do.
- I'm just different. I'm not smart. - Nah. Everyone's smart in some way.
You're just afraid of trying and looking not smart. That's textbook.
- What's a textbook? - You know what? Never mind.
- I'm different in other ways too. - There you go. Come on. Out with it.
- You won't say anything? - No. What is it? What's the sadness?
I don't know how babies are made.
Perfect. That's very class bully.
Tough on the outside,
a self-hating pile of cottage cheese on the inside.
- Can you just tell me? - Oh. About babies? Sure. Here we go.
First, the daddy climbs on the mommy's back while she's swimming.
He reaches under the mommy to find her cloaca.
This goes on for about 24 hours.
Then the mommy comes ashore, makes a nest, and deposits eggs in the sand.
My mom made eggs in the sand?
Yes. So the fish don't eat 'em.
I crushed it. Totally fixed the kid's problem.
The taping me up, maybe it's 'cause he wants to keep me.
Stop!
You miss your friends from being held back.
Worried about being behind?
This is a tough time, but these are the best years. Believe me.
Enjoy not knowing everything.
Enjoy being a kid. You're a good one.
Do you miss being a kid?
I'm just glad I'm still here.
Okay, every one of you has had a weekend with Leo here.
So from here on, you'll be taking home… What's the turtle's name again?
Squirtle. My name is Squirtle.
I think it's Squirtle.
Squirtle sucks.
I beg your pardon? Why?
I don't know. He just sucks.
- I like Leo, though. He's nice. - The best.
- Yeah! Come on… - Leo's better than that turtle.
Oh, stop that noise. Stop it! What is so special about this reptile?
I like his skin.
His skin is like my grandma's elbows.
Uh, same.
- Same. - Same.
- Elbows. - Same.
All right. If you all so desperately want to take home that lizard again,
you'll just have to earn it.
I wanna get picked!
We'll do our homework and promise to bring it in.
You will all make my class a model of excellence,
and even win that Academicathalon, or it's the turtle for all of you.
Yes! Thank you so much.
Was this your dying wish? To turn a bunch of brats against me?
It's not about us. It's about the kids.
They're motivated.
They're gonna finish the year strong.
Yes!
Yeah, Louis Pasteur is the father of microbiology.
He discovered that dangerous microorganisms could grow in open water.
Wow! Well, now, that's impressive.
Class 5-C, you're one step away from going to Magic Land Park!
How great a job has our teacher done?
Bravo, Ms. Malkin.
I know a lot of parents weren't happy when I first brought you in,
due to your rep as a miserable person.
But if you win the History Fair on Saturday, we'll...
You'll prove all the doubters wrong.
Well, Principal Spahn, in the classroom, sometimes the old ways are the best ways.
I can't believe it.
Back to your posts. No five-highing.
- Oh, that pic is fire. - Thank you.
Hey, what is the deal? I've been waiting for your next Jenga move for 30 minutes.
Now did you make the costume or did your mom?
Tell the truth. You know I won't tell anyone.
I only talk to you.
- What? - Is that another phone?
Uh, I don't know. Uh, must be on Malkin's desk or something.
- Hello? - Come on.
Leo, where'd you go?
I… I'll be right there.
Leo?
- Hello? - Hey, pal, toss it here. I'll handle it.
Can you hear me?
Leo?
Yeah, I think Malkin must have an extra phone.
Anywho, what did Summer say?
Oh my God, you can't all play Jackie Kennedy.
And, like, we so wanna slay this History Fair.
I know. That Magic Land Park trip would be awesome.
Hey, you're awesome because you tried your best.
That's why I'm your special friend?
Yeah.
You talk to Skyler too?
I… I just… Only because she...
That's Summer's phone in there, right behind yours.
- You happy now? For ruining this? - I don't know what happened.
I… I must've butt-dialed ya. I mean, butt-shot ya.
You don't even have a butt.
How dare you?
- You talk to all of us? - You said I was the only one.
You said I was the only one.
- I thought I was special. - You're all special. I...
I'm sorry! I just…
Seeing you guys getting along and doing great in class,
it felt like I was actually making a difference.
You did. This year would've been a nightmare without you helping me.
Ms. Malkin's so mean. Talking to you made the class bearable.
I was just worried if you all knew…
…other people would find out.
You told me not to tell anyone, and I didn't.
- Nobody did. Because we can keep a secret. - Yeah.
What, did you tell everyone I shave my unibrow?
Because I don't.
Hey, the only one he told about your unibrow,
or that you still eat your boogers, was me.
- And I barely chuckled. - What?
I'm leaving.
I tried.
Wait, it's Friday.
Aren't you gonna take me home?
Summer, it's your turn.
Please, I'm so sorry.
How can we trust you now? That was a question.
All right, what's everyone doing here?
Oh, you're leaving. Good. Take the whole day off.
You need to rest up for the history fair tomorrow. Go home.
Go. Shoo. Come on, out you go.
You and I have a lot to talk about.
I don't understand.
I… I know I lied to the kids. What did I do to you?
Excuse me, talking to my students behind my back? Advising them?
Okay. I feel terrible, but I was just trying to...
Undermine my methods!
Cheat me out of feeling any satisfaction from their success.
What? They learned everything you wanted. Why wouldn't that make you happy?
Don't think you can analyze me. I'm an adult.
Not a shrieking brat who thinks reading Canterbury Tales is torture.
It's not torture?
Quiet!
Asking me to be happy when I have nothing but these four walls.
- What about your family? - Excuse me, do you see any family?
Oh. Uh, not unless you're related to the gym coach.
- Those pictures are none of your business. - Gotcha. Never saw 'em.
I put my whole life into teaching just to be a mere substitute.
Never had my own class, never got any respect.
Look, I also had dreams that never happened.
Like seeing the Everglades, or spreading Salmonella.
But this year, I fell into something even better.
I really clicked with these kids.
Uh, maybe it helped, just a little, that you're a talking animal?
Yeah, but also, maybe it's you.
'Cause I've seen subs come through this school that kids love.
A fine teacher.
Wait, you were a student here?
You don't remember me? I was a lot different.
I was…
Oh, wow. Yeah.
You were very sweet.
I was adorable. And she…
Yes, she did.
She made me feel like I could do anything.
And tell me, do you think she was…
She made you her family.
That's what great teachers do. Even substitutes.
With the little time they have, they try to make a difference.
And that's what keeps them happy.
- Well, that felt wonderful. - I know you got it in you.
You're gonna get those kids first place tomorrow.
- Oh, you're coming with me. - No, please. They're mad.
Let… Let them focus on winning.
Well, I'm still taking you.
After they win,
we'll make sure they appreciate all you were doing for them.
You know what? You are special.
I couldn't sleep last night.
I couldn't stop thinking about what Leo did to us.
Let's just not talk about Leo. We're done with Leo.
We're ready. We can win this thing ourselves.
Good morning, my dear students.
- They look confident. - You sounded nice. Real warm.
Thank you. I'll keep you posted when I can.
I'm Betsy Ross.
I designed the first American Flag in 1776.
But I didn't just say what I thought the flag should look like,
I listened to others to see what they thought.
The result was the superior design we have today,
and also, people liking me more.
I'm Susan B. Anthony.
I played a pivotal role in the women's suffrage movement
in the 19th century.
But I'm not that special or great. And neither is my family.
So I can relate to average women who couldn't vote until 1920.
I'm Winston Churchill. "We shall fight on the beaches."
"We shall fight them in the fields and in the streets."
"We shall never surrender,
but we shall let them down easy, with a nice letter."
- "So they don't lose their minds." - This is wonderful.
You've taught them life lessons.
I… I can't hear anything. Can you open your pocket?
They burned me, Joan of Arc, at the stake, but I am not afraid.
Boo-freaking-hoo! Everyone's got problems.
I talked about it to a friend and felt a lot better.
Aw, I think that friend is you.
Malkin's Marvels, you're going to Magic Land Park!
Congratulations, class!
Yeah!
And to the first substitute to ever win Teacher of the Year!
You'll be chaperoned by Ms. Malkin and Coach Kimura.
Is it over? We win? When do I come out?
What's happening?
Ms. Malkin, can we go see Leo?
- Honey, it's about to rain. - We can't go to our class for one second?
You know what the rain does to my extensions.
I gotta say, I thought you were some kind of a twisted animal.
A rabid, bitter bag of mothballs foaming at the mouth.
But I've never seen my Jayda speak like that. It's like she's, uh, nice?
That's our Ms. Malkin!
You really got to know our kids.
- What a special lady. - Get this woman a full-time job next year.
Oh, I think we can arrange that.
She's helped Summer make friends.
Cole's proud of his voice, thanks to you.
- How'd you do it? - Well… You know…
That's, um… my stomach. I… I better go.
She's not gonna make it.
What happened? I couldn't hear nothing.
Did we win? I thought I was gonna see the kids.
We're going somewhere very special.
We're all going to celebrate?
What, a pizza party?
Wow, this pizza's out in the boonies.
What's goin' on? You're leaving me here?
What about the kids?
They lost. The class embarrassed themselves and blamed you.
What? What was all that cheering?
That was for the other class. I'm sorry.
What did I do? I've never felt so bad.
Don't say that. You said the Everglades was your dream.
Now you can live it out, with no chance of ever running into the children.
Or their parents. Or the principal. Or the media.
I said it was my dream.
The kids are what I...
- What? - Where is he?
- Is he hiding? - He's not hiding.
He was here.
- You seen him? - What happened?
What a shame. He must've run away.
- He left us? - Oh, look.
There seems to be some kind of note.
- Leo could write? - Of course. He could talk.
Oh! He talked to you people too? Oh, I thought I was special.
"Dear class."
"I've greatly enjoyed my time with you this year,
but I wish to move on and finally see the world."
"I realize I broke your trust, and that can't be fixed."
"But if you would be so kind,
please keep our conversations secret, so that I'm not harassed,
like E.T. or The Iron Giant , or Splash ,
or the classic, The Shape of Water . "
"Simply attribute your success to Ms. Malkin,
whose integrity is beyond reproach."
"Best Regards, Leo."
Well, let's try and be happy for Leo. He's doing what he wanted most.
But we never even got to thank him.
That's life, gang. Life gets more difficult the older we get.
It's called growing up.
Okay, everybody. Be careful on the Dragon Coaster.
Wipe the chair and the safety bar.
Doesn't matter what the teacher says, you call us every half hour.
And don't lick anything.
They tried to put the shift on Kabir when he was up, but guess what?
- He can hit to right field too. - Oh!
That is something.
- What do you think Leo's doing right now? - I have no idea.
Sure, kids, why flip over the musty old turtle before you leave?
Even though he knows the truth? But no, everyone's gone!
Everyone but me and that pathetic…
Wait. Where's the allergy kid's phone? Ah.
Here we go.
There's no time for lettuce. Flip me!
Okay, we gotta move!
Follow those brats!
Hey.
Shake it off, man. You're freaking everyone out.
Okay, let's hit it.
Ouch.
This is our last field trip together.
Why does it feel like our worst?
What?
- What is going on back here? - She did it!
- Excuse me? - I saw it. I saw the whole thing.
She took him out of the terrarium after you guys left that day.
She took him, and I wanted to say something,
but her and her vacuum,
they gave me the stink eye, and I slipped on, uh, somebody else's pee,
and I flipped on my back, and this whole thing is my fault
'cause I got jealous of my best friend instead of being happy for him.
I used the camera phone to bust him, but now I gotta bust you, Demeritface!
He's lying! This turtle can't be trusted. He turned on Leo.
Come on. You all know Leo's the reason you got this stupid trip.
He helped you with your weird kid problems.
That's why you won.
He wanted to do something meaningful with the rest of his pathetic time,
and he did it.
Why did you say, "The rest of his time"?
- He's dying! - What?!
He's gonna be 75. That's lights out for lizards.
- Oh, no! - He's dying?
But does Demeritface care? No!
All Demeritface wants is all the credit!
Another lie!
Then where is he, Ms. Misery?
Where's my best friend, Demeritface? Where is he?
- Out with it, Demeritface! - Where is he, Demeritface?
- What did you do with him? - Stop it! Stop it! Stop it now!
I took him, and I drove him away.
- That's crazy! Seriously? - I can't believe you!
He's right, I wanted the credit.
I thought it would make me…
- He's gonna die thinking we're mad at him. - Where did you take him?
The Everglades.
You sent him to the Glades? That's a terrible neighborhood!
- Those crazy animals will rip him apart! - Ms. Malkin, please help us find him.
We can't not see him again.
Hey there.
We need to change course. We're going to the Everglades.
What? We're going to Magic Land Park!
That's what the parents expect, and that's where we're goin'.
Oh my, our first fight.
Thank you. I'm fine.
Children, we're going to Magic Land Park.
Thanks, but a little too murky for me. How… How close are we to a drip tube?
Seriously, the microorganisms will kill you.
A kid told me that.
You guys never heard of Louis Pasteur?
What the…
- Someone help me out here. - Boss, is that you?
Wha... What?
Hey, that's the guy! The guy who set us free at that party.
That's the guy?
That's the guy.
I don't know what Grandma's thinking. We'll save him on our own, let's go.
Get this guy some algae.
And some of you.
Boss, you're gonna love it here. No trainers telling you what to do,
no bratty kids joking about your compact legs.
But I miss those kids.
What?
They're not bratty. You just gotta get to know them.
Like this one kid whose father's back had a gorilla situation.
I got this. You go back to the kids.
Hey, anybody see a buddy of mine?
He's green with bumps, got a tail, wicked ugly.
Okay, moving on.
- We're here, y'all! - Yes!
And I'm hungry.
- Let's do this. - Hi, welcome to Magic Land Park.
- Okay. Let me get... - A Cotton Dragon!
- A Wizard Puffs, please? - Me too!
- I'll take a Unicorn Balls. - Huh?
They're jawbreakers. Please?
Okay, gang. You getting all of this?
Oh, and I need one Fireblower hat.
Okie doke. Now we're ready, am I right, kids?
Are you kidding me? Hey!
- Go! Run fast! - Come on. Move it!
Come on!
Oh my God!
- Come on, Ms. Malkin. Hurry up. - Faster!
Just go. Go without me!
But you have to drive us!
Come on!
Come on, Ms. Malkin!
The Purell!
Whoever did this will pay! Help!
He's coming!
- We have to get out of here! - I got this!
- What? - I'm from the Bronx.
I've been driving since I was eight.
Oh my God!
Hey, pick a lane, lady!
I knew it. Leo?
Hey! Whoa, whoa. No. No, no, no, no, no. I hate it out here!
And I explained to them, I was just afraid someone would tell.
But now they're all mad at me,
and my funeral's gonna be even worse than Hammy #3's.
- Who's Hammy #3? - I think it's a sandwich at Arby's.
Why you talking about your funeral?
'Cause it's coming any day.
I'm almost 75 years old.
So what? We live to, like, 110.
What? But Skyler's dad said...
A hundred and ten, unless eaten by alligators.
I'm 97.
A hundred six. He's 74? He's a tween.
Look how fast he blinks.
I'm gonna live! This is incredible!
The guy's gonna live!
The guy's gonna live! The guy's gonna live!
I gotta get back to those kids. I can redeem myself!
And we're gonna help you.
The guy's gonna live! The...
I said I was sorry!
I'd kill for lateral movement.
Guys, before you do anything, let's talk about why you're angry, okay?
Anyone's parents getting divorced?
- Aren't you gonna stop? - I'm trying.
But I weigh 80 pounds and this thing needs oil.
This looks scary. Oh, my God.
Come on!
What the… Is that some kind of woolly mammoth?
I don't know, but it could kill us, right?
Uh, definitely.
We're here.
Get back.
- Oh, gosh. - Oh, no, no, no.
That's a demerit.
You need to chill.
Summer, talk to him.
So I don't know if you know, but it doesn't really matter.
We were supposed to go to Magic Land, which is cool.
I've never been there. I don't like magic and roller coasters.
They just seem really boring. They're scary, which isn't boring,
but you're not doing anything, you're just sitting,
when you could be playing soccer or baking a cake.
I mean, my mom's on a diet, so...
How could Leo ever survive out here?
How do we even start looking for him?
I just don't know.
What? Leo, no!
- Oh, no. Leo! - Leo!
Leo, we just wanted to thank you.
I'm so sorry I got mad. We all are.
We won the trip, Leo. All because of you.
You made me feel like I could do anything.
You brought us all together.
I never had a lizard that taught me so much.
Or any non-lizards either.
I'm not scared. I wanna hug you one more time.
What? They ate his insides!
I'm not...
I'm okay, pal.
- I can't believe it. - You're all right.
Sorry I scared you. When I get nervous, I tend to molt.
Old habit.
Awesome!
That was the best funeral I could ever have.
Wait, but if you guys won,
shouldn't you be celebrating in Magic Land Park?
We couldn't celebrate. We needed to see you before you die.
Oh. Uh, who told you I was dying?
The turt... Uh, Squirtle told us.
Well, I thought I was, but I found out I'm not.
- You're not? - You're not gonna die?
You're not still mad?
This is incredible.
- We love you, Leo. - Are you crazy?
This is amazing!
I'm so happy!
You're right about the endorphins. It really feels awesome.
Still coming. Give me a second.
Hey, glad you're okay. Sorry about busting you.
I want you to have something.
- Least I could do. - It's okay. Put it back on.
You're gonna get arrested.
You should all be proud. We've all learned so much this year.
Now, before I go, I want to finish something else
that Mrs. Salinas started.
I'm going to read the rest of Charlotte's Web .
- Ugh, is she kidding? - Let's just get through it.
"Charlotte was dying."
"'But I feel peaceful, ' she said."
"'Your success in the ring was, to a small degree, my success.'"
"'Why did you do all this for me?' Wilbur asked."
"'Because I liked you, ' replied Charlotte."
"'After all, what's life, anyway?'"
"'We're born, we live a little while, we die.'"
"'Perhaps, I was trying to lift my life a trifle.'"
"'Anyone's life can stand a little of…'"
What? I was wrong, okay? Crying's doin' so good for me.
- Still wish I could eat spider babies. - Nobody's eating any spider babies!
Hi, guys!
Mrs. Salinas.
- I missed you. Come meet Cole! - Yes!
- Can I hold the baby? - He's so tiny.
Only one baby.
I guess she didn't bury the other eggs deep enough in the sand.
How are we gonna get through middle school without you?
You'll be fine. It wasn't me. You did it.
You trusted someone to hear your problems. That's all we need.
Remember, everyone's scared. So don't keep it to yourself.
Find your Leo to talk to.
It could be your teacher, your mom, your friend.
Your turtle.
They're ready to listen. I promise they'll make you feel better.
Ms. Malkin!
Needless to say, you've made your mark here.
And as I promised, I'm opening up a class for you to run full-time next year.
Well, thank you, Principal Spahn.
But I'll need one condition met.
Whatever class I teach, I want these two alongside me as pets.
Well, okay. I don't see that being a problem.
- Look at this. We're going with Malkin. - Change of scenery. Should be good.
Congratulations, meet your new students.
- Oh God! - Not in the shell! Keep it clean!
Lot of energy.
This is good, we're finally gonna learn the alphabet!
- Oh my God! - Yeah!
- What about Summer? - She's nice.
Uh, vomit.
Way to be strong, Dad.
: I think you'll find our...
Napa Chardonnay to have hints of vanilla and caramel
with a velvety smooth finish.
Are you all right?
Some days are better than others.
Thanks for asking.
It's very good.
Yeah, 2004 was a great year for this wine.
Not so much for me.
Enjoy.
So, did I talk you into that soufflé?
- Uh, yeah, two. - Good call.
You won't want to share.
Oh, God.

Hm... More butter and salt.
They only need to live long enough to pay the check.
Beat those egg whites gently...
as if they were a small, annoying child.
Paul, you're on fire again.
Um, Christy, you got a second?
I can't talk now, Gabriel. I'm working.
Yeah, I know, but, uh, here's the thing.
I-I'm getting a lot of complaints.
Really? About what?
Well, apparently, one of my waitresses
- is having a nervous breakdown. - Is it Jennifer?
- No. - Is it Carol?
It's you!
Gabriel, what does this taste like to you?
- Uh, mushrooms? - The correct answer was "ass."
Listen, uh, maybe you should take the rest of the night off.
I can't afford to do that. I have children to feed.
Not a problem. Grab a couple steaks, head home and feed 'em.
You don't understand.
The guy at table 4 said something horrible to me
when I was telling him about the salmon.
- What's wrong with the salmon? - Nothing, the salmon's great!
- The guy insulted me. - Oh, that's fine.
- What did he say? - He said I was...
"a good waitress."
That's not bad. Or true.
I didn't grow up to be a "good waitress""
That was never the plan.
The plan was to be a psychologist.
Okay. You're a young woman.
- You can still do that. - Yeah, maybe.
I'd probably have to graduate high school first.
Now all I've got to look forward to is serving $60 risotto
to a bunch of smug food Nazis.
I mean, who are we kidding?
It's a big, steaming pile of gooey rice!
- What did you say? - Get over yourself, Rudy.
I saw you at McDonald's going down on a Big Mac.
First of all, it was a Filet-O-Fish.
- And for you? - Um, I'd like the, uh...
I'd like the, uh,
the pounded capon with, uh, lemongrass and thyme.
Excellent choice. You know...
that's a castrated chicken they beat with a hammer.

My daughter's an easy lay and it's not my fault.
- Hi. - I'm sorry. Did I wake you?
That's okay. How was work?
Oh, fun. I feel guilty taking the money.
What'd you do tonight?
Not much. Did my homework, watched TV.
Mmm. Is there a TV on your ceiling?
What?
Sit down. We need to talk.
What's up?
Violet, I can't tell you...
not to have sex at your age, because I had sex at your age.
Mom, I'm not having sex.
Don't lie to the woman who washes your sheets.
And in case you've forgotten,
I got pregnant with you when I was a teenager.
And please don't take this the wrong way:
- It ruined my life. - I love you, too, Mom...?
And I can't tell you not to drink and smoke pot,
because my senior yearbook quote was:
"Let's drink and smoke pot""
- Can this please be over? - You don't know how lucky you are.
My mother never bothered to talk to me about this stuff.
- Yeah, this is over. - Honey, I just don't want you
to wake up one day and feel bad 'cause you're not a psychologist!
Okay, good talk!
Let's get you back in your own bed.
- Hi, Mom. - Hi, sweetie.
- I waited up for you. - Thank you.
- Violet's boyfriend was over. - I know.
They were kissing.
I'm sure they were.
They took a shower together.
Terrific.
Are you coming to my talent show tomorrow?
Tomorrow? What time?
11:00.
Oh, honey, I have to work the lunch shift.
It's okay. I'm not good anyway.
Listen, maybe I can get someone to cover my shift.
Don't worry about it.
No, I-I want you to be able to look out into the audience
and see me, because that way you'll know how much I...
Shh! Mommy, I'm sleeping.
Good talk.
Hi.
You feeling better?
Oh, yeah. My home is a real oasis.
- So, am I in trouble with Chef Rudy? - He'll be fine.
He bought an eight ball and took home the pastry chef.
Sleeping with your boss. Who does that?
Roscoe: Mom...?
- Yeah, honey? - I had a bad dream.
Oh, no, well, um... why don't you go back to bed
and I'll come lay down with you in a second?
I'm so sorry. I owe you one.
Don't lay there too long. The sprinklers come on in ten minutes.
- What the hell? - Can I help you?
- What time is the talent show? - What talent show?
- There's no talent show today? - I don't think so.
Are you freaking kidding me?!
- I lost a day's pay for no reason? - Maybe we were destined to meet.
It would definitely be the high point of my day.
Psst! Roscoe!
Hi, Mom.
What are you doing here?
- The talent show? - That's not today.
- But you said it was! - Guess I was wrong.
I guess you were.
Don't you kids tease him about this.
: Son of a bitch!
Oh, God, I need a drink.
Hi, I'm Christy and I'm an alcoholic.
All: Hi, Christy.
I've been sober 118 days.
Oh, don't applaud for that.
They've been the worst 118 days of my life.
Um...
The only reason I'm here is because, uh,
I didn't want to turn into my mother.
And I did anyway.
Yeah, I drank like her.
I went through men like her.
Um, I was selfish to my kids just like she was.
And I didn't know how to live any other way
because she was my only role model.
I mean, some mothers teach their daughters how to bake.
Mine taught me how to beat a cavity search
and still feel like a lady.
Anyway, thanks for letting me share.
And I cannot tell you how comforting it is
to be in a room with people
who are just as screwed up as I am, so...
Oh, stop it.
Hi, I'm Jim and I'm an alcoholic.
All: Hi, Jim.
Aren't you a little old
to be blaming all your problems on your mother?
Hi, Mom.
Hi, I'm Greg. May I take your order?
Hi, Greg. I'm Bonnie and this is my daughter, Christy.
- Hi. - She and I haven't spoken
in a couple of years, so this is kind of a big moment for us.
Oh, for God's sake.
What can you recommend for a mother and daughter
who are reconnecting after a long, angry silence?
Um... pie?
- Mom, please, just order. - Um, is the mint tea decaffeinated?
- Yes. - Do you promise?
If I have caffeine after 2:00, my sleep in ruined.
- I promise. - Okay, Greg, but if I wake up
in the middle of the night, I'm calling you.
Well, I'll-I'll give you my number.
Um, and for you?
We have a lovely selection of local wines.
I'll have a bottle of each and a funnel.
She's kidding. We're both in Alcoholics Anonymous.
Mom, it's Alcoholics Anonymous,
not Alcoholics Tell Your Waiter.
Water is fine. Here, take this knife away from me.
So, when were you going to tell me you quit drinking?
Well, I was afraid if I called you,
I'd just start again.
Not that you care,
but I have two years clean and sober myself.
You're right; I don't care.
Well, regardless, it has really changed my life.
I have a steady job. I exercise.
I'm in a book club!
I have become the kind of woman I've always hated.
It is nice to see you wearing underwear.
And not on your head.
Greg: Here we go.
Oh, Greg, honey,
can I trouble you for some water without ice?
Ice isn't good for my digestive system.
- Yeah, of course. - Really? Ice?
I think your digestive system has seen worse than ice.
Excuse me?
Mom, I've watched you lick cocaine crumbs
out of a shag carpet.
It's not a sin to be thrifty, dear.
Okay, here we go.
Now, I hope that you're being nice to your mother.
- Go away, Greg! - Right.
Whoa, whoa. You know, just because you're sober
doesn't mean you can't take a Xanax.
Actually, Mom, it sort of does.
Really? Maybe I don't have two years.
And I don't need a Xanax; I'm doing great.
Well, that's funny, 'cause your daughter says you're
hanging on by your fingernails and sleeping with your boss.
Wait, when do you talk to Violet?
We talk all the time, and we're Facebook friends.
I don't want her talking to you.
Well, she has to talk to somebody. She's sexually active,
drinking, smoking grass. Sound familiar?
You're making this about me?
No, it's okay. I have come to understand
that you were the best daughter you could be.
My job is to forgive you, which I do.
Oh, my God!
- You forgive me? - I've come a long way.
Excuse me, but if anybody needs to be forgiven,
it's you, and I don't, and I never will.
There's hardly a day I can remember
that I didn't come home to an empty house.
Oh, don't be so dramatic.
While other mothers were cooking dinner, you were cooking meth.
Otherwise known as "working."
I don't want you in my life.
And while you're at it, stay away from my daughter!
She may need a better role model than me,
but it's certainly not you.
- Is, uh, everything okay? - My daughter doesn't get me.
Oh. I'm sorry.
What time do you get off work? I could use a lap to cry on.
Oh.
Stop crying. It wasn't an important finger.
This doesn't concern you.
Oh, good, you're still here.
Hey, hi. This is a surprise.
Yeah, I just really needed to talk to you.
I am having the worst day.
- Hey, you ready to go? - Yes, dear.
Um, Christy, you know my, uh, wife.
Yeah, hi, Claudia. Nice to see you again.
It's "Clowdia""
FYI, the ladies' room needs some attention.
I don't know if that's you, Christy.
It's not, and it's "Christ-y."
Okay, dear, let's go.
- Bye. - Yeah.
Don't serve the soup.
- Hey, Mom. Dad's here! - Yo, yo, baby mama.
What do you want, Baxter?
A father can't visit his son?
Not when he's six months behind on child support,
but you're welcome to wave at him through the window.
Be right back, Roscoe.
Don't be afraid to hit the hookers with a bat.
I think I may have found a way to pay you your child support.
Trust me, Baxter, you can't sell that much semen.
I know. I tried.
So, here's the deal: I know a guy who can hook me up
with a couple of kilos of premium Sonoma Kush.
All I need is $2,000...
...from you.
Just so I'm clear: You want to pay child support
by borrowing money from me so you can buy pot?
: No. So I can sell pot.
There's no money in buying pot. I know. I tried.
Luke: Oh.
Hey. Hello.
- What are you doing here? - Um...
studying...?
You let Violet have boys over while you're gone?
No, I do not, and don't worry about her, she's not your kid.
I know, but this sets a bad example for Roscoe.
Oh, you're worried about setting a bad example?
You had Roscoe pee into a sippy cup
so you could pass a drug test.
And it worked.
I like bananas. They have their own carrying case.
You know I can't divorce Claudia.
Her father owns the restaurant;
I'm pretty sure he'd fire me, and then what?
I was an English major.
I can't believe you're sleeping with that loser.
I can't believe you're sleeping with this loser!
Hey, we were mostly studying.
Shut up, Luke. I love him.
- Please, I used to love him! - She did.
Mom, Luke and I have been together for, like, a year.
You only started noticing when you stopped drinking.
You're right.
I-I haven't been a very good mother,
- and I'm sorry, but... - But what?
You want me to forgive you?
Oh, God, would you? That'd be awesome!
Why should I forgive you
when you can't even forgive your own mother?
- That's different. - How?
Okay.
Okay...
Hello, Mom, it's Christy.
Yeah, yeah, today was a blast.
Listen...
I just want you to know
that I forgive you for everything you did
when I was growing up.
I get, now, that you did the best you could...
...just like I'm doing.
And...
I hope that you and I can
wipe the slate clean and start over.
No, I did not take a Xanax from your purse!
Listen, I gotta go. Yeah, talk soon.
There. I've forgiven my mother.
- Are we good? - It's not that easy.
Oh, come on! Like me!
Roscoe: Hey, Dad!
If you hit the hookers enough times,
they give you your money back!
Smart kid. That's my semen at work.
- You still living in that red van? - Yep.
Looks like your house is being towed.
Oh, no, my cleaning lady's in there.
What a day, huh?
Hello...?
- Oh, hi, Mom. - Hello, sweetie.
What are you doing here?
I just thought I'd help out while you were at work.
You know, clean slate.
- You didn't have to do that. - Yeah, she did.
Bonnie made Roscoe and me hot dinner.
- Yeah, but I... - It was hot, Mom!
Like on TV.
Night, Bonnie.
- She calls you Bonnie? - We're like sisters.
You hungry?
No, thanks. I ate at the restaurant.
How about some tea?
Okay.
I'm so glad you and I have a chance to
start over.
Forgive me, but I'm not quite there yet.
Of course I forgive you.
You know... {*trnscr}
I apologized for beeing a crappy daughter.
- So, anything you wanna say to me... - I love you with all my heart.
And?
And... from now on, I'm going
to be the kind of mother you deserve.
This is the start of a new chapter.
Oh, it's my date!
New chapter, same book.
- Ready to go? - Let me just get my bag.
You remember our waiter Greg?
Hi, new dad!
Please stop. He's way to young for me.
And he's... married.
Married? What a whore.
Oh, I almost forgot.
Your daughter think she might be pregnant.
Call me, if you need me.
Previously on Mom...
I'm getting a lot of complaints.
Really? About what?
Well, apparently, one of my waitresses is having a nervous breakdown.
Is it Jennifer?
- You're making this about me? - No, it's okay.
I have come to understand
that you were the best daughter you could be.
My job is to forgive you, which I do.
Oh, my God!
Mom,
I've watched you lick cocaine crumbs
out of a shag carpet.
It's not a sin to be thrifty, dear.
I got pregnant with you when I was a teenager,
and please don't take this the wrong way...
it ruined my life.
Sleeping with your boss...
- who does that?
Roscoe: Mom?
Christy, you know my, uh, wife?
Yeah. Hi, Claudia. Nice to see you again.
It's "Clowdia."
FYI, the ladies' room needs some attention. I don't...
know if that's you, Christy?
It's not, and it's "Christ-y".
Oh, I almost forgot, your daughter thinks she might be pregnant.
Call me if you need me.
"Remove the test stick from the foil wrapper
and take off the over-cap."
"Holding the test by the thumb grip,
place the absorbent tip in urine stream."
You got to tinkle on it.
It's not the first time I've done a pregnancy test, mom.
Really?
Then why'd you make me read all those instructions?
Not important.
Let it rip.
Can I have some privacy, please?
Sure.
Violet, I just want you to know that
if it turns out you are pregnant,
I will support you no matter what you decide to do.
Thank you.
What do you think you're gonna do?
What?
You know, which way you leanin'?
- I don't know. Get out. - Okay, sorry.
You know, when I found out I was pregnant with you,
a home pregnancy test took about 20 minutes.
Uh-huh.
Now it's two minutes.
That's progress.
Yay, science.
I guess.
I mean, it's good news for you
because the nervous waiting time is less.
Mom, I can't do this if you're talking to me.
All right, sure.
- Pee-shy runs in the family. - Mom!
Sorry.
- Oh, good girl!
Be quiet!
- Hello? - Hi.
What's the word?
She's doing the test now.
We'll know in a couple minutes.
Wow. Gulp.
Yeah.
When I was pregnant with you,
- those home kits took, like, two hours. - Really?
It was a long wait in a gas station bathroom.
- Bonnie, is that you? - Yeah, honey.
- Can you come in? - Of course.
Why does your grandmother get to go in and I don't?
Because she won't lecture me.
I... I don't lecture. I...
share my experiences in the hope that you'll have a better life
than I had, and frankly,
I think you could be a little more grateful.
Oh, screw it, I'm coming in.
- What's it say? What's it say? - Nothing yet.
Oh, God, oh, God.
I know, it's so exciting.
I'm glad you're excited.
I'm scared to death.
Hey, don't you worry.
I'm gonna be here for you whenever you need me, 24-7.
Thanks, Bonnie.
I'm gonna be here for you, too.
That's your job, mom.
Ooh. Here we go, showtime.
Okay.
Wow.
You doing all right?
I... don't know.
Excuse me.
- I can't believe this. - Hey,
you have to take some of the responsibility for this pregnancy.
Are you kidding? We had the talk.
I told her about abstinence, condoms, everything.
Did you mention oral sex as a work-around?
Oh, my God, it is my fault.
When are you gonna stop with the bangs?
What?
I just... I understood it when you had a forehead
full of pimples, but now you're just hiding a pretty face.
This is the look now.
The first lady wears her hair like this.
Well, I don't think it works on her, either.
Noted.
What are we gonna do about Violet?
I love her hair.
No, the pregnancy.
I don't want her to wind up like us.
What's the matter with us?
The fact that you don't know speaks volumes.
She has options.
I know.
Did I ever tell you how close I came
to giving you up for adoption?
What?
Lovely Jewish couple from San Francisco, the Lowensteins.
She played cello for the philharmonic,
he was a cardiologist.
- You never told me this. - Oh, yeah.
They offered me $25,000 for you.
Why didn't you take it?
They sound fantastic.
Well, they were, but you were my baby girl. I loved you.
If you really loved me, you would've sold me to the Lowensteins.
Maybe if they'd gone to 30.
I've made a decision.
I'm gonna be a mom.
Okay.
Well, then,
congratulations.
We're having a baby.
I'm so happy for you, Violet.
Thanks.
And the great thing about having a baby so young
is after a few years, you can tell people the kid's your sibling.
Right, sis?
That's not as cute as you think it is.
Uh, couple of questions.
What about high school?
What about it?
The baby won't be born till after I graduate,
so it shouldn't be a problem.
I guess the next thing to do is call Luke.
- You think he's the father? - I know he's the father.
How about that? Old-school.
- Grandma! - Ah, ah, ah.
Aunt Bonnie. There's my boy.
Why do you have glitter on your shirt?
Dad took me to his girlfriend's apartment.
I learned how to swing on a pole.
He's a natural.
I thought your girlfriend worked at Bed, Bath and Beyond.
Doesn't mean she can't dream.
Okay.
Go wash the sad lady off your hands.
Thanks for taking him this afternoon.
Hey, I'm his dad. If I can't spend two hours a week with him, who can?
It's not always great knowing who the father is.
Why is my son pregnant?
Well, that's a window into a dark room.
- Sorry. - You okay?
- I'm fine. - Come on.
Okay. Well,
I just found out my teenage daughter is pregnant.
Really? Wow.
She's not a cheerleader with an overbite, is she?
- No. Why? - No reason.
Okay.
Nice talking to you, Chef Rudy.
Stay strong, waitress whose name I do not know.
Thank God.
- Here we are. - Oh.
How is the Chardonnay?
It is delicious. Good choice.
Oh, yeah,
back in the day, I could get lost in a bottle of this stuff.
One time, I woke up in a Best Western hotel
with two of the roadies from Counting Crows.
But I'm sure that won't happen to you.
- Hey. - Hey.
I miss you.
Oh, thanks.
You miss me?
Yeah, sure, I guess.
That's not very encouraging.
I'm sorry. I got a lot on my mind.
Well, I'm a good listener.
A penny for your thoughts?
Okay, fine. How's this?
I'm working my ass off so I can take care of my children,
I just found out I'm gonna be a freaking grandma,
and the man that I'm sleeping with
only has time for me when his wife is out of town,
and I desperately want to run away
from it all with a bottle of this
but I can't because my name is Christy and I'm an alcoholic.
Ola, Christy.
Man : In this moment, my life is perfect.
In this moment,
my life is perfect.
I breathe in love.
I breathe out fear.
I breathe in love.
- I breathe out fear. -
Ah, I...
Didn't see you there, Luke.
I could tell. How's it going?
Pretty good. Um, Violet texted me that we needed to talk,
so I came right over after work, and I brought sliders.
Yum.
They give us the ones that smell iffy.
Double yum.
Yeah, it's a pretty sweet perk.
So how was your day?
- Not great. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Mine's been awesome.
I got promoted to shift manager
and found five dollars in the men's room.
It wasn't even that wet.
- You're on fire. - Right?
Come on in.
Let's see what the rest of your life looks like.
- Hey, Vi. - Hi, Luke.
Um, I'd kiss you, but
I don't want your mom to get the wrong idea about me.
Has that ship sailed.
So, what's going on?
- Well, I got some kind of big news. - Cool. What?
Okay, um... Violet, wait.
Luke, can you give us a minute?
Sure. I'll nuke these bad boys so we don't get the squirts.
Isn't he amazing?
Yeah.
I just think it's important that you understand
he might not have the maturity to deal with this situation.
I'm just gonna hit the popcorn button and see what happens.
Luke loves me. I love him.
We're gonna make this work.
Honey, I just don't want you to get hurt.
Young guys spook real easy,
and you can't count on them sticking around.
Whoa.
I think I know what you wanted to tell me.
You do?
Yeah.
You're having a baby.
So close.
Violet?
Luke, I'm having a baby.
Wait.
So you're both pregnant?
No, just me.
Oh.
Well, that's...
so cool!
There's still time for you.
Not much, but keep at it.
Thank you.
So you're not gonna get scared and run off?
Why would I run off?
I love you, and I'm gonna love your baby.
Um, it's our baby.
What?
Even better!
That's why I get so frustrated with the people at work.
I slept with that guy.
Really?
He cries when he finishes.
What do you mean?
- Like a happy cry? - No.
More like a...
And that tiny dude over there in the red shirt?
Did you sleep with him, too?
Well, I wasn't going to at first because of our height disparity,
and then I decided to do it anyway as, like, a good deed.
That's how you get into heaven.
Letting a little guy go up on you.
I wish. All he wanted to do was spank me.
Well, no good deed goes unpunished.
I had to sit on my hip for a week.
So how many men at this meeting have you slept with?
Oh, please, this is a sacred space
dedicated to recovery and healing.
Six.
Woman: Anyone else like to share?
Oh, me.
Haven't you shared enough?
Hi. I'm Bonnie, and I'm an alcoholic.
- All: Hi, Bonnie. - I just want to start by saying
how grateful I am to this program.
Not only am I happily sober, but so is my daughter.
And let me tell you, she was a hot mess.
Come on. Stand up, honey.
Let everybody see how pretty you are now.
Imagine her without the bangs.
P.S. She's single, fellas.
Not for you, Spanky.
Anyhow, it's just a real gift to have her back in my life.
And, uh, I know I wasn't the world's
greatest mom when she was growing up,
what with all my drinking and
drugging and dealing and
managing an international escort service
with ties to the Russian mob, but...
you know, it's hard to have a career and be a mom.
Am I right, ladies?
I remember this one time, she was five years old.
Maybe she was 11.
The point is she was little.
And I pulled her out of school,
moved us up to Manitoba
where I opened up a daycare center
that was a front for an ecstasy distribution hub.
It worked out really well
until one mountie had to be a freaking hero.
You are so lucky to have her for a mother.
You don't have to tell me.
- She's a... - I mean it!
You don't have to tell me.
Don't get me wrong. I love Canada.
Hey, remember Canadian beer?
Wasn't that great?
Hello?
Violet?
- Did you finish your homework? - Yep.
Did you brush your teeth?
I think so.
Mmm, what do you mean, you "think so"?
My brain is full.
I'm worried about the Middle East.
Violet: All right, you'll brush twice as long in the morning.
Get in there.
Middle East.
Want to know a secret?
Sure.
You're gonna be an Uncle.
Cool.
Do you know what that means?
Yeah.
I'm your boyfriend and I get to sleep over.
No, that's a different kind of Uncle.
It means that I'm gonna have a baby.
Really?
A human baby?
I hope so.
But I'm gonna need your help.
- With what? - Taking care of the baby.
Oh, sure.
I'll take good care of it like you take good care of me.
You're gonna be a great Uncle.
- Roscoe: I have a secret, too. - Violet: What's that?
I haven't brushed my teeth in three days.
You little stinker!
Mom?
- - What's wrong?
You're a better mother than I am.
I know.
You're gonna love my gynecologist.
He's got very small hands.
Like an Asian raccoon.
Mom, please!
I'm gonna be an Uncle.
Unless it's a girl. Then I'll be an aunt.
I respect your open-mindedness.
Gotta give this kid Luke points for showing up.
He claims he loves her.
Well, we'll see.
I had three significant relationships
end while I was pregnant with you, so...
Christy?
- Carla? - Hi.
- I haven't seen you since high school. - Yeah, hi!
Wow! Look at you.
Yeah, finally getting around to starting a family.
And you?
I, uh...
I'm fighting a nasty yeast infection.
And with the support of her entire family,
she will win this battle.
Am I right?
Oh, come on.
And there is your baby.
Wow.
Luke, look what we made.
Unreal.
I can't wait for it to grow feet
so I can make moccasins for it.
Mom, come here.
I'm gonna need your help.
I'll be here.
Mom?
I'm gonna need your help.
I'm not going anywhere.
"Clitoris."
Well, someone's in a good mood.
You know,
I am.
I am just...
- loving my life right now. - Mmm.
Cocaine?
Family.
Family.
That stuff will kill you.
- What is missing from Me Too?
I... it's difficult for me
to say,
- but I don't think - it's a coincidence
- That most of the women - who have come forward
- In Hollywood - have been white women.
- I don't think - it's a coincidence
That they are generally
quite successful.
If we look at the earning power
of people in America,
for example,
at the very top are white men,
and at the very bottom
are women of color,
and that is something
that I think is necessary
to look at when we are talking
about who gets to come forward
and give their own stories
about surviving sexual abuse
or sexual assault.
- America picks and chooses
who they're gonna listen to.
- Not only does class - have an indicator,
But what that person
looks like has an indicator.
So who we decide to listen to
is totally predicated
on who we see as valuable
in America.
- A lot of black women
felt disconnected
from Me Too initially.
They felt like, 'That's great
'that this sister is out there,
'and we support her
as an individual,
but this movement
is not for us.'
- If we're gonna
move this forward,
it can't simply remain
a problem of the beautiful,
- the wealthy,- the popular.
This has to be a moment where,
yes, that might lead us,
but we need to be able
to make sure
that a broader group of women
are introduced
into the public consciousness
at the same time.
- It is high time
that the lens turns to us
and that we're allowed
to be heard
and, more importantly,
believed.
Where is it?
Okay, so I think I have
to look in my closet.
How could I have lost it
so quickly?
Here it is.
Yeah, this is the demo
for 'Junior M.A.F.I.A.'
That's insane, right?
- Yeah.
With Lil' Kim and...
- I think actually- Biggie gave me this,
Or Daddy-O must have given me
this demo.
At the time, Biggie was...
Let's just call it
a entrepreneur.
So he was working outside,
you know?
- He just lived- around the corner,
And he was trying
to be a rapper.
- I was trying to be- a rap A
- We were all trying- to be something.
- Tell the people
what you're here for
- It's the message- in the song
That makes you rock on
Some people go to places
Where they don't belong
Whether wrong or right
A lot of people fight
But I'm here to bless
This mic, all right
- When I lived here,
I worked at Empire
Artist Management.
I was a receptionist
pre-Def Jam.
I was working with Gang Starr,
DJ Premier,
Jeru the Damaja.
This is how I would walk
to the train,
and I specifically walked this
way because Biggie told me,
'Walk down my block
because I run my block
- 'and everybody knows- you're cool with me,
'so if you walk down my block,
- you're not gonna have- any problems.'
- I mean, it was different.- It was the early '90s.
- There were crack vials- everywhere.
It was still, you know,
rough and rugged.
I always wonder
what would have happened
if Biggie had lived.
I feel like Biggie...
Biggie had my back.
Music has always been sort of
this language that I spoke.
Everything from, you know,
the Doors to the Beatles
to Prince to jazz.
- You know, my mom was a big- Billie Holiday fan,
So I consumed Billie Holiday
voraciously.
- I mean, I would stay up- in the middle of the night
And organize my mom's albums
on the living room floor
and I would just play
the songs in order
and I would chase the fades.
I would turn it up to catch
every last drop of the record
because some of the best stuff
was in the fade.
Hip-hop then also had this
additional appeal to me
as this sort of black movement
that was empowering people
- who were otherwise lost- and overlooked,
- And I grew up feeling- like that was my mission
As the daughter
of local politicians.
I grew up in the thick
of black D.C.
- You know,- knocking on doors,
Trying to convert one voter
at a time,
and then hip-hop just combined
two things that I loved:
activism and this sense
of pride with music.
And it seemed like it could
sort of, I thought,
change the world.
- Mayor Dixon, are you...
Mrs. Dixon, are you prepared
to take the oath?
I am indeed.
- Would you please place
your left hand on the Bible?
- When my mom was elected
mayor of D.C.,
I took my junior year off
from Stanford
to help
with her inaugural ball,
and in the process of putting
together her inauguration,
- I had the opportunity- to pick the artists.
- So I picked Rare Essence,- my favorite go-go band.
I picked KwamÃ©.
- I came here for something
Funky to happen
- And I picked Big Daddy Kane.
- Let me hear you say ho
Ho!
Say ho
- Suddenly I was interacting- with the people
Behind the scenes,
and it occurred to me,
'Oh, what about those jobs?
'Maybe that's what I should do.
- 'There's, like, this industry,- and there's people
- 'who aren't the artists- but they kind of
'make it all happen.
Maybe that's the thing for me.'
And so when I found out
there was this job called A
where you could discover
new artists
and make great songs,
- you know,- I started reading 'Billboard,'
And I had all of these books
and magazines,
and Russell Simmons
was a huge part of, like,
that sort of ideal.
Like, that's where I wanna be.
I mean, I drove across
the country to New York
with a dream
to make hip-hop records.
I mean, I... I can't even put
into words how excited I was.
- I was an A
at EMI Records.
- I met Drew when she'd- just finished college
- And she had moved to New York- from D.C.
She was, like, this bright
spirit that came out,
and we hit it off right away.
- I started by answering
phones at various companies
from Jive Records
to Warner Bros. Records
and eventually became
a publishing executive
at Zomba Music Publishing.
- Drew was a young, powerful
something to watch.
An interesting,
intelligent woman
who cared so much
about this music.
- After about two years
of just being in the mix,
eventually I guess people
sort of figured out,
'Oh, this woman is always
hanging out and showing up
and knowing what's hot.'
- And so when Def Jam called me- and was like,
'Russell wants to offer you
this job,'
I mean, I was thrilled.
I was... it was my...
- It was like, 'That's it.- I won.'
Yes
Was the start of my last jam
So here it is again,
another def jam
- Who didn't wanna be- Russell Simmons?
- I mean, he had the foresight- to cultivate
What was in these clubs
and in these streets
in New York City
- and make it into, like,- this business.
- The Russell Simmons
that I met
when I was 21 or 22
was the godfather
of the whole damn thing.
- I met Russell
at Disco Fever.
Disco Fever was, like,
the popular club in the Bronx
that everybody who was somebody
was able to go.
You know, he was like God
to everybody.
- Everybody always looked
at Russell as Def Jam,
so that's a black label.
'Cause the major labels
was not touching us.
- They were saying,- 'You a fad.
What is this rap thing?'
- He managed Run-DMC,
one of the first groups
to ever break the mold
- with pop music- with Aerosmith.
- That had never- been done before.
- She told me to
- Walk this way
Talk this way
- And Drew was there
in the middle of, like,
all of this swell of hip-hop,
and Def Jam became the royalty
of labels to be on.
- Working for Russell Simmons,
doing A
I mean, I could not
have scripted it better.
- Exactly one month since the
first 'New York Times' story
about Weinstein's harassment,
more and more powerful men
have been held to account.
- They've been accused- of harassing
Or assaulting behavior,
so what is next?
Or maybe I should say,
'Who is next?'
- So when the Harvey Weinstein
stories started coming out,
it was upsetting.
- I didn't know anything- about him.
I didn't know him,
but it was so familiar,
and I was so grateful
- that those women- were being believed,
- 'cause I knew... I could- just feel in my bones...
Like, I know what that's like;
I know what that's about.
But I was also kind of like,
'I don't really wanna read
these articles.
'I don't really
wanna take this in,
'because I don't want this
to get too close to me,
'where I'm gonna have
to decide,
'well, what would I do
- 'if I had the opportunity- to come forward?
I don't think I wanna
even think about that.'
And also, I felt like,
as a black woman,
- I was like,- 'I don't know if this applies.
I don't think this applies.'
- Victims of sexual harassment
in Hollywood
- continue- to tell their stories.
This morning, allegations
surfaced against Brett Ratner,
- a filmmaker best known- for directing
The 'Rush Hour' trilogy.
- When Brett's name came up,
- then I literally started to get,- like, you know,
The, like, knots in my stomach.
Like, 'Oh, boy,
here we go.'
And then Russell's name
started to come up
in the stories about Brett.
- The 'Los Angeles Times'- revealed accusations
Of Simmons teaming up
with Hollywood director
Brett Ratner
to allegedly assault women.
- And then literally- what happened,
- One of my friends,- she said,
- 'You know, I'm friends- with Jodi Kantor
- At 'The New York Times.'- Do you wanna talk with her?'
- I was like, 'No, no, no, no, no,- no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I do not wanna be radioactive.
No.'
But then he denied everything,
and I was so infuriated that
I texted her back and I said,
'Okay, intro me
to Jodi Kantor.
Just intro me.'
I spoke
to 'The New York Times.'
So I met with Jodi
and Joe Coscarelli,
the other reporter,
and I was like,
'This is off the record.
'I'm just meeting with you.
- 'I just wanna kind of generally- tell you my story,
'and you guys tell me if you
think it's even worth,
- you know, documenting.'- Mm-hmm.
- So they were like,- 'We'll think about it.'
You know, 'Just think about it.
- Let's stay in touch.'- And, um...
- What are the stakes for you
in terms of this, like,
coming out?
- Chaos.
I don't really want chaos
'cause I have kids
and my husband
doesn't like chaos.
- Have you talked to your kids?
- My kids know generally
that men
behaved inappropriately
with me in the music industry,
and that's all I said.
And I'm also just afraid
that after finally finding
some sort of peace after
some really rough years,
it's inviting more chaos
into our lives.
So this is, um, where Def Jam
used to be.
160 Varick Street.
Spent two years of my life here.
You know, I definitely remember
somewhere along this street,
catching cabs because
I have #LightPrivilege,
so I would, like,
get the cab,
and, like, I remember, like,
Method Man and Redman
- would be like,- 'All right, guys,
Everybody in, everybody in!'
I would be, like,
the stealth cab catcher.
This was Def Jam in the '90s.
This is where it all went down.
- I was an executive assistant
at Def Jam.
It didn't feel like an office
so much as almost, like,
you're in a...
Like, a club.
- When I started doing outside
counsel legal services
for Def Jam,
- Russell had in place- someone else
Who was really running
the operation day-to-day.
- That was Lyor Cohen.- Very, very so...
I mean, he's legendary
for being, you know,
just this hugely strong
personality.
- Russell and I's daily
meeting was at Danceteria,
'cause he was just nonstop:
'and we're going to do this,
'and once we do this,
we're going to do that,
and goddamn,
she's fine.'
- So Lyor was president- of the label
On my first day.
At some point, he called me
into his office and he's like,
'I don't know
who the fuck you are,
'but I don't have any time
for any of Russell's
'tall, skinny bitches,
'so this is what
I want you to do.
'If you see me in the building,
'if you see me in the hallway,
'find the nearest open office...
'the nearest open door,
- 'go into it,- and hide,
'because I don't want
to fucking see any tall,
- 'skinny bitches who are friends- with Russell.
Got it?
Got it, tall, skinny?'
I was like, 'Got it.'
- It was clear what he meant.
There was this perception
that I had a certain kind
of relationship with Russell,
which was definitely not true,
and so I didn't wanna fail.
I mean, how much better
of a shot could I get
than being the director
of A
This has to work.
And so the only way to really
get his full attention...
'cause he was quite scattered...
Was to be in front of him.
- So I would stay in touch- with his driver, Kenny Mac.
- 'Where is he gonna be and when- is he gonna be there?'
- He'd be like, 'He's gonna be- in front of the building.
Just come out now.'
And that's essentially
how I made it work.
Eventually Russell gave me
a soundtrack to put together,
and it was
a hip-hop documentary
- and it was like a survey- of hip-hop.
- Put your hands in the air
if you's a true player
- So when you're pulling
a soundtrack,
you have to get all these
different types of sounds
for the score.
- The R to the E
to the S-P-ECT
- Working with
that kind of a budget
and it's, like,
your first record to do,
it was, like, a daunting task,
- but, um, like, she was- definitely up for the challenge.
- Here you had
very sophisticated deals
that had to be done
to license these songs,
to license the sound recordings
of the songs,
artists that you had to deal
with all their representatives,
and so she had a lot
of ground to cover.
- I just started picking up- the phone and calling, like,
- 'Hi, my name is Drew Dixon.- I work at Def Jam.
- 'We're doing a soundtrack- about hip-hop
And I think it's important
that you're represented.
- 'I wanna represent- the Midwest.
- 'I wanna represent- the South.
- 'I feel like- these are the genres
That represent
the state of the art,'
- and I just sort of made it up- as I went along.
- Like, I called- Bone Thugs-n-Harmony
- Out of the clear blue- 'cause I saw them
On "Video Music Jukebox,"
- and I just called them and said,- "Can we have a song?"
- And they were like, "Cool,"- and even, like,
- Def Jam was like, "Who?"- And I was like, "Trust me.
They're dope.'
- It's an everyday thang
- When you let- your nuts hang
- And at the end of the- record, I have a shout-out.
- 'Everyday Thang,'- if you listen to it.
- Much love to Drew
and everybody at Def Jam.
- It was my first shout-out.
- It was so great.- Well, they were like,
- 'You're from Def Jam- and you're calling us?'
I was like, 'Yeah,
you guys are dope.'
- Tupac was on that album.
Slick Rick,
Dr. Dre.
She got Method Man and Redman
on the record together.
- Method Man and Redman.
That literally meant she gave
some of the best MCs
on the planet a deal.
That's dope.
That's dope.
- 'The Show' was a big success.
Um, I worked on other things
that were big successes.
I, um, heard an interlude
when they were working
on Method Man's album,
- and the interlude literally- was just Method Man
A cappella saying,
'Shorty, I'm there for you
anytime you need me.
- 'For real, girl,- it's me in your world.
Believe me.'
- Believe me
- Nothing make a man- feel better than a woman
- Queen with a crown- that be down for whatever
- I was like, 'Wow.
Well, that's dope.
'That's, like,
a hip-hop sonnet.
That's dope.'
- Like, I remember- telling Russell,
'That's a song.
That's not an interlude.
And it should be a duet.'
- I was like,- 'What about Mary?'
He's like, 'Okay.'
- And then I remember- a phone call with Puffy.
And he's like, 'Okay, so I
have an idea for this record.
Do you know the song
'You're All I Need to Get By'
- by Marvin Gaye- and Tammi Terrell?
I was like, 'Of course I do.'
- He's like, 'Okay, can you sing- the Tammi Terrell part?'
- And I was like, 'Okay.'- You're all I need
- You're all I need
- All I need- To get by
- To get by
- Aye
- He's like, 'Okay,
now imagine the...
The 'Children's Story' track.'
He's like, 'Okay.'
- Shorty, I'm there for you- anytime you...
- And I'm, like, singing Tammi- and he's like...
- For real girl- I was like, 'Oh, my God.
'Mind blown!
Yo, this is crazy!
Oh, my God.
We have to do this.'
- To this day
when you hear that song,
- you know that the people- behind that had a vision.
First of all, you had to know
- that Mary and Method- go together.
They just do,
but who knew?
- The record won a Grammy.
I mean, literally,
it's on Obama's mixtape
- of his favorite songs,- and I'm like...
After the duet was successful,
- and then 'The Show' soundtrack- hit number one
On the R
shipped platinum,
- it really helped build- our credibility
With PolyGram records.
I was suddenly on the radar
with the parent company.
I wasn't just Drew Dixon
from Def Jam.
Lyor sent me this, like,
massive gourmet gift basket
to thank me for my hard work
and to sort of say, 'I'm sorry
I didn't appreciate
how talented you were.'
- That's one- of the beautiful things
About the music industry.
If you have a great work ethic
and you have some talent,
you can end up
running a label.
- So it is a space- where there was
A lot of mobility for women,
but at the same time,
there was tremendous amount
of sexual harassment that was
just baked into the culture.
Thank you, Daddy.
- Music comes with a certain
sense of promiscuity.
Like, whether you're an artist
- or the... you're the guy- making the artist,
You have that kind of power
where sex is just part
of the game.
- When things went awry,
if things were uncomfortable,
if they were misogynist,
if they were sexist,
you didn't get a lot
of sympathy for that, you know?
That was considered
the price of admission.
- The first time Russell
was inappropriate with me,
we were at CafÃ© Tabac.
- He was waiting outside- of the restroom
- As I was leaving the restroom- and he grabbed me
And pulled me into a closet
and tried to kiss me
and I got away,
and then it started happening
in my office,
and he would come in
and lock the door.
- The first couple times,- he would just try to kiss me
And I got out of it,
but then Russell escalated
- from pushing me- against the wall
- To literally coming in,- not touching me,
But exposing himself.
I thought that he was,
like, this tragic, like,
ADD puppy dog that I just had
to keep retraining,
but then he wasn't,
like, violent.
- He always sheepishly
apologized later,
so I thought, 'He feels bad,'
and he would sort of back off
for a while, and then
he would do it again.
I guess I thought it was part
of the culture
and I needed
to just manage around it,
and then eventually I thought
that I had proven myself
and was now too valuable for him
to wanna burn the bridge.
I thought,
'I am an executive with value,
'and he's a businessperson,
- 'and he's a very- well-regarded one,
So surely he'll leave me alone.'
I really didn't understand
that all of those
other violations
of my physical boundaries
were breaking me down.
- You stay because you hope
that perhaps you can
provide enough value
to the company
and move ahead,
but part of the ability
to ascend
is contingent upon your ability
to either, A,
comply with someone's
sexual advances
or letting them think that they
might have a shot in hell
without encouraging them.
- It's something that you have- to go along with
Because the alternative
is that you'll be unemployed.
- I think for a lot of women
of that era,
it's only now that we're really
unpacking how toxic
so much of that time was.
- When I was in college
and rap started,
it was like party music,
and at some point, I remember
dancing and... and singing along,
and then words... 'bitch,'
'ho,' you know,
stuff like that started
coming into the music,
and I was like,
'I'm not quite sure
if I'm down for this.'
- I'd say by mid-'80s,
you have your G Raps and
you have your hard-core MCs
who are introducing misogyny
over, like, dope beats
and then things
become palatable.
- And then you introduce video
at the level video begins
in the '90s, and women began
to look alike.
They were all typically
light-skinned.
They all had long
and/or wavy hair.
It was clearly a statement
against the large majority
of black women,
how we look
and how we present.
- And go dig in them guts- like a gardener
If she starts screaming,
I'ma fuck the bitch harder
- I actually think that- the things that are being said
About black women
are actually racist.
You know,
you're basically dancing,
you know, to, um, ideology
that had been, you know,
spread by defenders of slavery.
You don't realize that this
is basically the same kind
of idea that justified the...
The abuse of black women
for centuries.
- When I was younger,
- I would look at the women- and I would judge them, right?
- And I would feel- some type of way,
But as I get older,
- I look at the culture- that breeds that.
- Hip-hop certainly didn't
invent misogyny in music.
Just did not.
Every other music form
essentially
has some level of misogyny.
- Hip-hop has always
been reflective
of the world that we live in.
These white patriarchal
power structures that exist,
we just mimic them,
and we carry them on
and make them our own.
- Hip-hop was not just
about misogyny,
that hip-hop was not just
about sexism.
- We got to fight
the powers that be
- And even though
it may have been couched
in very hyper-masculine
imagery and language,
there was really an expression
of, like, pain
- and struggle- and what it meant
To grow up with the legacy
that the hip-hop
generation inherited.
- You stand in solidarity
with the movement
as a black woman.
You don't parse the sexism
within the movement
as a black woman,
and we were all so excited
about hip-hop and what it meant
- that we just sort of- tolerated it.
We laughed it off.
- We thought, like,- 'Whatever.
'It's, you know, like...
It's...
Don't be so thin-skinned,'
is sort of what we said
to anyone who pushed back
against some of that language,
and now that I'm older,
I realize that language
set a tone,
but I didn't see it that way
at the time.
'The New York Times' is doing
a super-rigorous
background check
to determine if I'm even
a credible source,
and I haven't even decided
if I'm gonna do this...
If I'm even gonna go
on the record.
- Hello?
- Hey, Joe.- How are you?
- Good, and you?- I'm okay.
Is this an okay time?
- Are we... are we on camera?
- Uh, you are,- so if you don't wanna be,
We can... we can remedy that.
- Yeah, I mean, I think
this'll probably be, like,
- sort of sensitive.- Okay.
- Uh, I don't know.
I, uh...
- I don't really know- what the rules are,
But I just feel like...
'cause we wanna sort of
take you through the story,
uh...
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah, I don't... I don't know.
Uh, let me merge Melena
onto the call.
- Is that okay?- Sure.
I don't have a game plan.
Zero.
I haven't told the story
in probably a decade,
and talking to the reporters
just brought it all back.
That particular night,
we were all at the Bowery Bar,
which was very common,
and he left ahead of me,
which I think I actually
purposely waited for
because there had been times
when he'd sort of
followed me out,
and I had to walk by
his apartment to get a cab,
and he stopped me
- and he asked me- where I was going,
And I said I was going home
and I was just getting cash
to get a cab,
- and he was like,- 'Don't be ridiculous, Money.
- 'Like, you've got- this hit record.
'Like, you're a big deal.
'Like,
you're a big executive now.
Why don't you, um,
let me order you a car?'
And so I went upstairs,
and this was the first time
- I literally walked- into his apartment
And I was alone,
and I... I immediately
felt uncomfortable,
and so then I said,
'Why don't I wait downstairs
for the car?'
And he said,
- 'No, no, no, no,- no problem, Money,
'but there's a demo that I got
that you're gonna love.
I want you to hear that first,'
which is catnip for me.
I was like, 'Really?
Okay.
'Um, why don't I
take it with me?
I'll take it with me.'
And he's like, 'Okay, cool.
Um, it's in the CD player.'
I'm like,
'Where's the CD player?'
'It's in my bedroom.
- Just go in there- and make a left.'
So I go in and I see
this huge, daunting stereo.
- I remember I was struggling- to figure out
How to turn it on.
The next thing I know,
he is naked
wearing a condom,
and he just grabbed me.
He just grabbed me,
and he just threw me on the bed
and he wrestled me to the bed
and pins me down,
and I'm fighting,
and I'm saying no.
He's telling me to stop
fighting in a very cold...
Menacing,
detached voice
that I'd never,
ever heard from him before.
Um, I see handcuffs dangling
from the canopy.
I'm not saying for one second
- I had any interaction- with those,
But they scared me,
and I just blacked out.
I blacked out.
I blacked out,
which is something survivors
often do.
It's, like,
a self-preservation tactic.
The next thing I remember,
I was in the bathtub
with him naked
and he says,
'And so now that you
and I are fucking, Drew,
we'll hang out
and we'll fuck all the time.'
And I was just like,
'I'm gonna go.'
- I don't know if I said,- 'I'm gonna go.'
Maybe I said I'm gonna go.
- I got out,- I'm naked,
I'm wet,
I'm naked walking around his bed
trying to find my clothes,
and I walk home.
I lived 22 blocks away.
I walk home.
And when I got home,
I got in the shower
with all my clothes on,
- and I took, like,- a cold shower,
Lying down just crying,
and I just laid there
for a really long time.
I was reduced to nothing
in that moment.
I was nothing.
I was trash.
Nothing about me mattered.
Nothing about anything that
makes me who I am mattered.
I was a physical object.
I was a physical device.
I was a physical...
I... I... some physical thing
that he utilized
for his pleasure.
- At that time,- when she came to me,
- She had told me that she had- been assaulted
A few days earlier.
- I believed her- when she told me.
I could see it in her face,
like, something had happened.
- That spirit,- that light wasn't there.
Like, it had been, like,
almost, like, taken away.
Then I had asked her, um,
'Are you all right?
Do you wanna go to the police?'
And she was reluctant
because she was like,
- 'No one's gonna- take me seriously.
'He's, like, Russell Simmons.
Like, who's gonna believe me?'
- I think I must have
continued working there
for a little while longer.
- I remember going in- for some meeting
And he was in the building
and asked me to sit on his lap,
and I just remember
feeling like, "My God."
I'm like...
'He thinks I'm that person now.'
'I'm not that person.'
And so then I, like,
submitted a handwritten letter
of resignation
- which I wrote once and had,- like, all these cross-outs,
But I literally did not even
have the physical strength
to crumple it up
and start again.
- And they were like,- 'Do you want more money?
- 'Do you wanna be- a vice president?
- How much money- is it gonna take?'
This is Russell talking.
And then finally Lyor
was like, 'Stop.
'Stop talking.
'Let her go.
She's gone.
Let her go.'
And that was it.
Yeah.
So...
Wait, that was a call
from California.
That's scary.
Hey, Joe.
Like, every 310 phone call
I get today,
- I have to tell,- you I've had a heart attack.
I'm like... I think it's, like,
either Russell or LA,
- and I'm like,- 'Oh, my God, oh, my God,
- Should I not answer?- Oh, my God.'
- Mm-hmm.
- Sure, okay.
- Mm.
Okay, okay.
'The New York Times'
called me back and said
there were other women and
there were other black women
who've been assaulted
by Russell,
- that they won't- go on the record
Unless I go on the record,
but I'm still terrified
of the backlash.
- I remember my senior year- and Stanford,
Watching
the Anita Hill hearings.
- Professor, do you swear- to tell the whole truth
- And nothing but the truth,- so help you God?
- I do.
- He spoke about acts- that he had seen
In pornographic films
involving such matters as women
having sex with animals
and films showing group sex
or rape scenes.
- I was like, 'Well, that
didn't go very well for her.
'He's on the Supreme Court now.
I'm never gonna do that.'
- Now, again,
for the record,
did he just say,
'I have great physical
capability and attributes,'
or was he more graphic in...
- He was much more graphic.
- Can you tell us what he said?
- Well, I can tell you that
he compared his penis size,
uh, he measured his penis
in terms of le... length,
um, those kinds of comments.
- I mean, that's one thing
about being a victim
of sexual abuse.
The words are on your mouth.
You're the one that has
to disgust the world
- by telling them- what happened to you,
So you then become associated
with this vile,
vile act.
You are defiled again because
you have to tell people,
and they see it on your lips.
- Unequivocally,
uncategorically,
that I deny each
and every single allegation
against me today
that suggested in any way
that I had conversations
of a sexual nature...
- And then the person who did it
is shocked to the core,
as is society,
so then they're aligned
with society like...
Clutching their pearls.
- It is a high-tech lynching
for uppity blacks
who in any way deign
to think for themselves.
- And you have this tawdry,
sordid
nastiness on your lips,
so you seem gross.
- There are a lot of people...
And you know it, Desiree...
Who say
2:00 in the morning
in a man's room with beds,
what... what were you doing there
at 2:00 in the morning?
- I just wasn't thinking.
It... there's... you know,
there's no other explanation.
- And then I remember- Desiree Washington,
Who was the pageant winner
who was raped by Mike Tyson,
and, like, the black community
was not kind to her.
- "The Washington Post"
conducted interviews
with young women
in college of your age,
black women,
and they didn't seem to show
a lot of sympathy.
One said, '18-year-olds are not
naive in this day and age.
- What did she think a guy wanted- at 2:00 in the morning?'
Another said, 'She asked for it.
She got it.
It's not fair to cry rape.'
- It's sad.
It's sad that women
in 1992 feel that way.
- It's like,- 'Oh, no.
'No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
'I'm never, ever
gonna be that person.
'He's Russell Simmons.
He's the king of hip-hop.'
'No, I'm never gonna be
that person.
'The black community
will hate my guts.
No.'
- Black women's need, um,
and really duty that we feel
- to protect black men- is definitely
- A hindrance- to protecting ourselves.
There's this added layer
in the black community
that we have to contend with
of, like,
'Oh, you're gonna put this
before the race?'
- Right, 'You're gonna put this...- Because this...
- 'you let this thing happen- to you,
Now we have to pay for it
as a race?'
And... and then we're silenced
even more.
- On the one hand,
- they are in an incredible amount- of pain
And want their perpetrator
to be punished,
but they're also fearful
of being cast as the person
who is putting a black man
in the line of fire.
- Many black women will allow
race loyalty to buy them
an early tombstone because
they cannot reconcile
the idea of engaging in
- American criminal- justice system
That has been so brutal
to black men.
- This whole- ride-or-die mentality
Is killing black women.
- There's part of us that, um,- we're innately designed
To protect them because America
destroys our men, right?
- So we're designed- to protect them
From what America
has historically done to them.
- From slavery to beyond, like,- to Jim Crow,
Like, we're designed
to innately protect them
'cause we know the struggle.
- If we go back historically,
we know that one
of the allegations
that led to the lynching
of black men
has been sexual assault.
So there has developed over
time in the black community
an awareness that lynching
is an expression
of white supremacy.
It's a particular expression,
the sexual projection
of black men
as being dangerous.
- You're worried
as a black woman
that you'll say something
that will have
consequences that you
hadn't anticipated.
Even down to just calling
the police.
- Your responsibility
to muffle, you know,
your screams is greater
than his responsibility
not to do it in the first place.
- It's a very, very terrible
burden to bear
to know that you might still
be judged as somehow
being a traitor.
- Are we gonna pile on?
We're gonna add fuel
to the fire of the myth
of the sexually aggressive
black man?
I don't wanna do that.
I wanted Russell
to be a hero too.
I mean, for 22 years,
I took it for the team.
- Russell Simmons is the king- of hip-hop,
And I was proud of him
for that.
So I took it for the team.
I didn't wanna let
the culture down.
I love the culture.
I loved Russell too.
- Turn your head
to the left for me.
Turn to the right.
I think it's important
that you do tell your story
because people, like...
Little girls need it.
Even grown women with little
girls inside of them
need it... to hear,
like, 'It wasn't just me.
- Oh, my God, somebody else- went through the same thing.'
Like...
And you're showing, like,
your daughter, like,
'Look, no matter what happens,
you can overcome it.'
And really, more people
are abused than they talk about.
- You know?- Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
- I grew up in a certain part
of the Bronx.
When you used to go outside,
on every corner,
somebody was playing or rapping.
You have Grandmaster Flash
playing on one corner
and you could have Kool Herc
playing on the other.
It was empowering, like,
to hear somebody's talking
about where you're coming from
and... and actually making
our neighborhood
look fabulous, you know?
- And me,- I felt important.
- You know, when we discovered- hip-hop and rap,
That's... we went for it.
Mercedes Ladies is the first
all-female DJ and rap group
in hip-hop history.
We had to be tough because
we was going against
an all-male arena,
and that's how we met Russell,
and so I told him
Mercedes Ladies is looking
for some serious management,
so he's like,
'Oh, yeah, I heard of y'all,
- and I wanna get you- in the studio.'
So for three,
four months straight,
we was just rehearsing
every single day.
He had us in there for hours,
and we was like,
- 'We're finally gonna get- our chance, you know?
After the hard work,
it's finally paying off.'
And then one night, he says,
- 'You wanna come see- my new office?'
It was a little, small office,
and then he's like,
'Sit down, sit down.'
- So then he sat down- next to me,
So I thought we was
gonna talk business,
and the next thing you know,
I'm pinned down to the, um...
The couch that he had,
and I could remember
I kept saying,
- 'What are you doing?- Like, get off of me.
What are you doing?'
So I'm trying
to force him off of me.
It happened so fast.
He had his pants down,
and it just...
He just took, took,
took what he wanted.
When you're raised in that
environment in the hood,
everybody was taught
that things happened.
You just didn't talk about it,
and so I just always
put on this front.
Like, everybody always say,
um, 'Sheri, how you doing?'
- And this is me,- always with a smile.
- 'Oh, I'm okay.- I'm okay,'
And then I, um,
finally realized,
all these years,
I wasn't okay.
I wasn't okay,
but I'm taking more control
of myself now
and forgiving myself
and... and starting to know
who my... my worth is
and not... my worth is not based
on things I've been in life
and all the unfairness
that was done to me in life.
My... my worth is based on that
I got through these things
and I'm still standing.
- It was in '94.
I was modeling.
I was living in Europe.
I was in Italy working,
and I came back because I...
There was some personal drama
that I was going through,
and I reached out to Russell
'cause we had stayed friendly.
We hadn't had any type of
physical sexual relationship
in close to two years,
and it was really odd.
I remember he was
drinking Pellegrino,
- and I was like,- 'You're not gonna have a drink?'
'Cause we used
to party hard together.
And he said... he said,
'No, I'm not drinking.
I quit drinking.'
I said, 'Okay.'
You know, he was...
He was coming on to me.
He said something,
and I told him, I said,
- 'Russell, I've got- a boyfriend,
And I'm really happy,
and that's not happening.'
And... and he grabbed my hands
and he said, 'Sil Lai,
we are friends.'
He said, 'That's your pussy,
'and I would never
take anything from you
that you didn't give me.'
And at a certain point,
I said to him,
'I wanna go home,'
but instead of taking me
to my girlfriend's place,
he took me to his place.
I figured I would just crash
like I'd crashed
at other friends' houses.
I remember I came upstairs
and I passed out
on... on his bed
and I heard some noise.
I think he had gone
to take a shower,
and he... and I opened my eyes
and he is walking towards me
and he's naked except
he's wearing a condom.
I kept on saying,
'No, no, no,'
and... and I remember thinking,
'My boyfriend, my boyfriend,
my boyfriend.'
And then he raped me,
and I couldn't fight.
I couldn't do anything.
I just lay there.
And then when it was over,
I remember he just said,
'Okay, well,
you know,
I'm gonna have Kenny
take you home,'
and I get dropped off
and I go upstairs
and I... I freaked.
I freaked out.
I...
I... I mean, I just...
I was so angry
and I was so filled
with self-loathing
and I was so filled
with guilt...
And rage, just rage
over what he had done,
and so I swallowed...
I believe it was 18
prescription sleeping pills.
These things were lethal,
and I kissed my son good-bye.
I just remember looking at him
and seeing how...
How beautiful
and how pure he was.
I mean, he really was
such a beautiful child,
and, um...
I was like,
'Your mother's a failure.'
'She can't do anything right,
and nobody treats her
like a human being.'
'You're just a fuck toy.
You're a chew toy
for men of power.'
'This is your life.'
'How are you going to be able
to give him anything?
How are you gonna be able
to be there?'
- And I said...- You know,
- My girlfriend- that I was staying with,
She was older...
20 years older than me.
She was very responsible,
and I said,
'Carol's gonna be
your mommy now.'
Eventually I get taken
to the hospital.
- It's too late to pump- my stomach.
They give me
activated charcoal,
and it was touch-and-go.
The doctors said that
had I gotten there 20,
25 minutes later,
I would have been dead.
It's definitely the low point
of my life,
and it caverned me,
and I left fashion.
I didn't wanna do anything
where I would see people
who were adjacent to this man.
Russell was everywhere
I looked.
- Now you tell me
who the fuck is winning
I'm on my Russell Simmons,
Nicki denim, Nicki linen
- Our special guest- Russell Simmons,
A man who needs no introduction.
- He was named one of the top 25
most influential people.
- The one and only,
the godfather of hip-hop,
Russell Simmons is in the house.
- Oh, man.
- Russell Simmons went on
to create clothing lines,
'Def Comedy Jam' on HBO,
- and 'Def Poetry Jam'- on Broadway.
- Russell Simmons- is one of the wealthiest
Entrepreneurs in the world.
- He later sold his stake
in Def Jam for $100 million.
- Who's the animal- invented lower living
The projects thank God
for Russell Simmons
- A pioneering philanthropist
- who's also a 'New York Times'- best-selling author.
- He describes the journey
in his new book, 'Super Rich.'
- He's out with a new book,
'Success Through Stillness.'
- This whole idea- of being selfless
- And giving all this effort- to the world
But not taking care of yourself,
you're not as good a servant,
- so you have to take care- of yourself.
- You know him
as the godfather of hip-hop.
- Russell Simmons!
- Thank you so much.- Thank you.
I love you.
- I told a few friends about
what happened with Russell,
but I didn't tell
that many people.
- I just wanted- to put it behind me.
Even in that dark shame,
I just wanted to make records.
Once I decided, okay,
I have something to offer,
well, let me try again.
And then finally I met Clive,
and I loved Clive.
He was a music man.
So I started working
for Clive Davis
at Arista Records
in May of 1996,
and I was back.
I had a run of phenomenal hits.
- A rose is still a rose
- Lauryn Hill gave me
'A Rose Is Still a Rose'
for Aretha.
- Your love is my love
- Wyclef gave me 'My Love
is Your Love' for Whitney.
- So I worked closely- with the artists
Who made the Album of the Year
two years in a row.
Lauryn one year...
- 'The Miseducation- of Lauryn Hill,'
Lauryn Hill.
- Carlos Santana
the next year.
- And I was good.
- I had a hot hand,- and I was back.
And then in 2000,
L.A. Reid replaced Clive Davis
as my boss at Arista Records.
- L.A. Reid is one- of the most important
Black music producers
and black record executives
really of the past 20 years.
He discovered TLC,
Toni Braxton,
Usher,
Outkast,
and I really admired him.
- And then when I worked- with him,
- All of a sudden,- it just changed.
It became,
'Meet me at the Four Seasons
when you leave the studio.'
And so I felt like,
'Okay,
'maybe I can just
sort of be flirtatious
'and play along and,
you know,
he can play with my hair
in the back of the car,'
and... and then you realize
this is gonna end one way.
He wants me to come to the hotel
with him and listen to music
and I just keep not going,
and he gets meaner and meaner
and meaner,
and there are more and more
professional consequences.
I auditioned Kanye West,
and not only did
he pass on Kanye.
L.A. Reid dressed me down
in front
of the entire A
- 'Drew, this was not only- a pass.
This was a waste of my time.'
And I remember after, like,
a 45-minute
dressing down, saying,
- 'Kanye's still- in the waiting area.
'Can I just go tell him?
'Cause he's waiting.'
- And I remember I brought Kanye- into my office.
He had tears in his eyes.
- I was like,- 'Let me tell you something.
'You're gonna get a deal
You're gonna win Grammys.
- 'You're gonna look back- on this.
'You're gonna laugh.
Promise you.'
John Legend was the last
artist I tried to sign
- back when he was- John Stephens.
I scheduled an audition
for him with L.A.,
and he was really excited.
We even booked a concert space
two days before
so that he could rehearse
with his band,
and then L.A. told me
he didn't wanna go,
and he told his senior staff
not to go.
He passed on him.
He just passed.
So I walked in all alone
and watched John perform
with his band
in the folding chairs.
I was the only one there.
I had to tell John,
'I can't sign you.
I'm so sorry.'
Unless I sleep with L.A. Reid
as a quid pro quo,
not because I like him but
literally as a quid pro quo,
I am doomed.
- I mean, I can't get- John Legend
Or Kanye West signed?
I mean, I'm dead
in the water now.
So I give up.
I give up.
I give up.
After a decade of working
my way up from the bottom
of my industry,
I just quit.
I also completely and utterly
cut myself off from the parts
of myself that I love the most:
my creativity,
music.
I mean, I don't listen to any
of the songs that I made.
I don't listen to them.
I just...
I tried to bury that part
of myself in, like, a manhole.
And I just tried
to become cerebral
and steady.
So I thought,
'I'm going to Harvard
Business School.'
I ran away from anything that
might even get anywhere near
- that pain- and I turned around
And I scorched the earth
so I would never,
ever have the option
of going back.
What I'm grateful for is that
I met my husband there
- and we got married and had the- two most wonderful children
On the Earth,
and I really did wanna be able
to be the person
that absolutely covered them
365 days a year,
but there was a part of me
that was sleepwalking.
You know, I just ran away
from my dream,
from my passion.
- Let's get started
with breaking news.
- Allegations- of sexual harassment
Are rocking
another media mogul.
- This time,- it's Russell Simmons.
- In a scathing letter- to Simmons
- Published today- by 'The Hollywood Reporter,'
Screenwriter Jenny Lumet
alleges Simmons forced her
to have sex with him
back in 1991.
She writes in very graphic
and disturbing detail...
- There were three things
that pushed me over the edge:
Jenny Lumet's piece...
- First of all,- she's a black woman
Putting herself out there.
She specifically said,
'When I read
Keri Claussen's account
'and he called her a liar,
I couldn't let her twist
in the wind knowing
what I know,'
and I remember thinking,
'Well,
- 'I can't let Jenny twist- in the wind.
- 'I mean,- I don't know her,
But I can't let her twist
in the wind.'
The other thing
was Beverly Young.
- She was one- of the Roy Moore accusers,
And she was crying on TV
about him assaulting her
when she was
a 16-year-old waitress.
- Mr. Moore reached over
and began groping me
and putting his hands
on my breasts.
Instead of stopping,
he began squeezing my neck,
attempting to force my head
onto his crotch.
- I saw her on TV crying,- and I thought,
- This is her hometown.- She's in her 60s.
- These are the... these are- the only people
- She's ever known,- and she's standing
In her hometown where she will
spend the rest of her life,
in all likelihood,
putting it all on the line
and being called a liar.
That's brave.
- And then the other thing- that did it,
I read Harold Perrineau's
statement
about his daughter Aurora,
and he said he was terrified
- when she decided- to come forward,
But he said he looked at her
the other day and realized,
- 'My daughter's not- a victim anymore.
She's a warrior.'
And I thought,
'I'd like to be a warrior.
'I'm tired of being a victim.
'I've been a victim
for 22 years.
'Let me see what
the other thing feels like.
Can't be worse.'
And that's when I said,
'Okay,
I will go on the record.'
- Hey, Joe,- it's Drew.
Just out of curiosity,
in any of the other cases,
have the sources
been contacted?
So I can literally say,
- 'If you wanna talk to somebody,- if you wanna comment,
- You can speak- to the reporters'?
You're saying that to say that
his lawyers would tell him
not to call me?
Right?
- Okay, are you only reaching out- to Russell,
- Or are you also reaching out- to L.A.?
So he isn't...
So they're both in the story?
Okay.
They are both going to find out
that they're in the story
either tonight
or tomorrow morning,
and they will know that they
are in the story
and that I named them.
- From recent searches,
and this is a search
of information about,
- uh, the United States- proceeding?
- Well, it's, uh...- It's a query.
- The White House- and President Trump's
- Private attorneys- will go over the part...
- Joe texted me.
They have Russell's
lawyer's response.
He admits harassing me.
He denies sex.
He says we made out a few times,
and he, uh... the 'Times'
will call me once they talk
to their lawyer.
Wow.
If locking someone
in their office
and pulling your penis out
and making out with them
in a tiny space
- where they can't escape- is making out a few times,
Then that's an interesting way
to describe it.
Can't do that right now.
- I don't think- I should call anybody.
I don't wanna, like,
rope anybody into my, like,
mania right now.
I'll just wait for them
to call me back.
- Hi.- Just the paper.
- Do you need a bag?
- Uh, no, thanks.
$2.50.
I'll just do the $20.
- Russell Simmons is strongly
denying new accusations
that he raped three women
decades ago.
All three women say
their music industry careers
were derailed or ruined.
Simmons says he categorically
rejects the allegations.
- In extensive reports
in the 'LA Times'
and 'New York Times,'
nine more women accuse Simmons
of a wide range of misconduct.
- Russell invited me out.
Um, he wanted me
to see his new apartment.
- I felt really safe with him,
and I don't think
we were comrades,
but I felt like we were,
I mean, peer...
Like, hangout peers.
- And we talked a lot- about yoga.
We talked a lot
about spirituality.
- And he said, 'Well, why don't- we go back to my apartment
And we can talk there?'
- And suddenly here I am
and he has pinned me.
- It was just so out
of left field.
- I remember being really shocked- to the point where I...
I thought it was a joke.
- And I was absolutely shocked
and taken aback
and I froze.
- He pushed me into the door...
In through the door
- and pushed me down- on the ground.
- I remember fighting it,
fighting on the bed,
because I didn't want
his penis in me.
- He puts his knees on my legs
and pins my hands down.
- I think of it akin- to that feeling
That must happen when you think
that you're on a plane
and it starts to go down.
- That, "No, no, no,- this isn't happening."
- That anybody could so swiftly
and forcibly penetrate me...
Um...
While... actually while
I'm saying no.
- He wanted
to physically dominate me
and rape me.
- I pushed him off of me
and I was like,
"What the fuck are you doing?
- What the fuck- is wrong with you?'
- I kicked really, really hard
and I fucking screamed,
- and I... and I just ran- to the door
- And he, like,- let me go.
- I had to really do some
dark nights of the soul
- to work through this layer- of shame.
- He took a piece of me with him
when he did this,
and then... then he carried it
with him,
and he carried it with him
for three fucking decades.
- On Instagram,
- Russell Simmons was defiant,- writing,
'Today, I begin
to properly defend myself."
- Simmons again denied
all the allegations of rape
and other misconduct,
- and then he posted- the hashtag,
And he used 'NotMe.
- You think you'll be vindicated
at the end of all this, man?
- Honestly, I mean,- I wouldn't...
- I don't have a stitch- of violence in me.
I would never hurt anybody.
And I never had
any violence in me,
but, you know...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, no...
- It's a difficult time- for everybody.
- Absolutely, absolutely.- All right.
- Thanks, guys.- All right, man.
- We'll be watching for you,- Rus.
- Have a good one, man.- Take care.
- Have a good night, you guys.- Thank you guys.
- You pinned me down
with your entire might.
I was screaming.
I was crying.
I was begging.
- Have a good night, Rus!
- That's violent.
That's violent.
You're violent.
- There is a discourse
that says that it's still,
like, a cultural impossibility
for black women to be raped.
- They, um, use their sexuality
as gold diggers.
They use their sexuality
as means of control.
Um, you really can't
sexually abuse
- or rape a black woman- because there's nothing
That they wouldn't do.
- White women are always...- There's a stereotype
Of being, like,
docile and sweet
and innocent and pure,
and if this docile and sweet
and innocent, pure
can still get questioned
and not believed and discounted,
- what do you think is happening- to black women in America
When we come forward with
stories about sexual violence?
- It's enraging.
It's enraging to know that
you are more likely to be harmed
and yet fewer people
are going to believe you.
- Fewer people are going- to help you.
- The system doesn't appear set up- in any way to help you.
- We're not entering
into America's history
with any kind of protection,
and that has a lot
to do with our history
from the transatlantic
slave trade.
- When I was 26 years old,
my dad invited me to go
on this trip with him
to West Africa,
and we went to
St. George's Castle in Ghana.
So it's this big fort, really,
and in the middle
of it is a church,
and then on either side,
there were two chambers...
- One for women,- one for men...
Where the slaves were held,
and in the courtyard,
the women were chained
to a cannonball by the ankle,
and they were selected
to be raped by the governor
or they were raped
by the guards.
These women had no right
to say no
for the rest of their lives,
and so I think more than half
of the women were pregnant
by the time they got on the boat
for the middle passage.
The other thing that
was really striking to me,
there's this little room
and there's scratch marks
and this is where the men
who attempted to defend
the women were taken to die.
So just the intentional
cruel breakdown
of the black
male-female dynamic
from the beginning.
And...
I understand the plunder
of black men
and I understand...
The burden of black men,
but I also think it's time
for somebody to acknowledge
the burden and the plunder
of black women.
- What did you think- of the article?
How are the millennials
taking it?
- I was really happy with how
the article was written
and that they didn't hesitate
to be very clear, like,
this is... not only is this these
particular women's experiences
but because they are black
- and because they're- in this industry,
This is what
it is like for them.
- All right, I'm gonna play
this, um, clip
from Hot 97 this morning,
which I'm actually kind of
scared to listen to
'cause Hot 97
is where hip-hop lives.
- Mm.
- So that would be, like,
a very pro-Russell platform.
- Let's hear it.
- On Hot 97.
- So 'The New York Times'
- posted a report- that four women
Are detailing their experiences
of sexual misconduct
and rape from Russell Simmons
between the years
of 1988 to 2014.
- Hold my hand for this.
- He said, 'I absolutely
have not raped anyone.
Absolutely not.'
Russell's somebody I consider
a friend in this business.
At times like this,
it is about having
open conversation.
- Doesn't mean- I don't like Russell.
Doesn't mean I don't like what
he's contributed to hip-hop,
- but it does mean that- the way you go about...
- I disagree.- Sexualizing women
- And your behavior has been- out of line for a long time,
- And it needs- to be addressed now.
- Can I ask the tough question- in the room, though?
Does it sound like
we're being nicer to,
- easier on,- and more open-minded
About Russell than anyone else
who's caught an accusation?
I could at the very least say
I thought he seemed coarse
- and inappropriate probably- around women,
And now he has several
rape allegations,
some of which are from women
who are very credible,
- worked in the industry- at executive levels, not...
- And who's saying
they don't believe them?
- I'm saying the tone
we're having to me is one
that's much more like,
'Well, open.
Let's have dialogue.'
- We didn't do that- for other people.
- Mm-hmm.- Even though we have evidence
To that he was...
Has been a... a dirtbag,
we're all kinda keeping our lips
a little bit pursed
and not going the next step.
- He's real.
- Russell's like,
'That's not how I remember it.
I'm stepping down.'
- Then the rape allegations- come out.
He's like, 'I absolutely'...
- But is that why- he stepped down?
Why'd he really step down?
- Mm-hmm.- Because... I don't know.
- Why?- What are you saying?
- Because he knew more
were coming, guys.
- And guess who else did.- We did.
- Word.- Word.
- There's these... all these- women who were trying
To make it in the industry.
One had to... what...
- She just ran away,- and guess what.
- Then she ended up working- for L.A. Reid.
- And then he did- something to her.
- And then he did it!
- Yeah.
- Sorry, that's not where- my prayers went.
- My prayers were, like,- to any woman who's had
- To be in this industry- the last 30 years.
Wow.
- Uh, when... when
Drew disappeared,
it didn't strike me per se,
because a lot of women
had started to disappear.
- So when did you find out
why she'd left?
- Um, when I read
'The New York Times.'
And it was devastating to me.
Devastating.
I was shaking for days.
Every story... every Russell story
is personal and...
Hard,
really, really hard,
and so when I read that
about Drew,
I was in bed.
- I stayed in bed- because I was like,
'This is my Drew.'
I immediately went
right back there
to my 23-year-old self.
I know her! So well.
Even now, like, this has
just unpacked so much,
- it's just forced me to think- about all the things
That I've endured
and experienced
and seen,
and particularly with Russell,
because I was
a 22-year-old woman
alone with Russell
in the early '90s,
and so I know exactly
what is possible,
and even though I...
You know, I have fear
around speaking, um, publicly
for all the wrong reasons, like,
I'm smart enough to know
that shame has no place
and, you know, all the things
that I would say
to any younger woman
who needed my counsel,
I have all
the right things to say.
Um, but I'm also
a very private person.
I'm also a journalist.
I'm not used
to being the subject.
And this isn't a rape story.
That's another reason why I...
I think I don't want
to conflate
my story with other stories.
But the fact remains that you
can keep something inside
for 25 years
and keep on keeping on,
and then a thing can happen
like the bravery
of someone like Drew
or Sil Lai
or Jenny
or any of these women
who have dared
to say a name and speak
to a specific time
and you didn't have
to reconcile.
You've gotta deal,
and that's really why
I showed up today.
I'm here really to bear witness
and to say I'm really sorry
to all of these women
who have suffered,
and to those who
will never tell their story,
that's okay too.
I believe you too,
and there's so many of us
who believe you too.
So, um, you know...
You know.
- I am looking forward
to meeting Sil Lai.
Her story just came out
in 'The Hollywood Reporter.'
And I'm always happy
to see Jenny.
I've met her twice now,
and we've gotten to know
each other over text as well,
and I consider her
a sister already.
It's this bond that's hard
to describe.
- Come in, come in, come in!
Wow, I'm seeing you in person
after all this time!
- Jenny?
- Hello.
- Here, have a seat here.
- I... I was, like, in mom mode.
- Me too.
- Well...- I was making pancakes.
- This is good.- I can have a BeyoncÃ©, like...
- Right in the wind.
- I'm doing this mental
checklist with everybody.
- Oh, yeah.
- 'Cause I wanna know
who I know is still supporting
this man 19 allegations in.
- Oh, yeah.- Are you an ally?
Are you a real ally?
Are you down with him?
Do you support me?
Why do you not
say anything to me?
Why do you stay silent?
- It was kind of
like I did not...
Expect, uh...
Anyone to be in it
for the long haul with me,
and I was okay.
- Mm.
- Um, it'd be lovely,
but I'm glad I met you guys,
- 'cause we're in it- for the long haul.
- Like, I don't... I've been
in bed for four days.
Like, I don't know
how to do this.
I don't know... how do you tell
your story in front
of a national...
In a national forum?
But at the same time
realizing the privilege.
Like, looking at us,
we're all light-skinned.
We're all
'conventionally attractive.'
The fact that our story
has been told
- is a privilege.- Mm-hmm.
- It shouldn't be a privilege.
Every woman's story
deserves to be heard.
- Part of the reason- I did speak out
Is because I do have
light privilege,
so I have to go ahead
and stick my neck out
and say, 'Me too,'
for other black women
who are not safe.
- I wasn't prepared
in whatever way
to speak at all until 2017,
which is the first time
I said anything to anybody.
And I thought...
'I wish I could have gotten
my shit together earlier...'
'So he would have left
everybody alone.'
- The aftermath
of coming forward is just...
You can't even begin
to describe what it's like,
but someone else out there
knows exactly what it is,
you know, and to go through
the first,
the assault,
and then the coming forward...
And there's a bond.
You know, there's a bond there.
- I don't know
that there's any comp...
Like, any comparable...
- No, there isn't- any comparable...
- Experience to coming forward,
being believed,
finding other victims...
- The trauma,- the coming forward...
- Of the same trauma
by the same person
and suddenly we're together.
I mean, I'd been alone
for 22 years.
I thought it was just me.
- Meeting you was,
'I'm not alone.'
- Yeah.
- Meeting you now is,
'I'm not alone.'
Um, it's a big deal.
- It's a big deal.
After the article came out,
I asked my husband
for a divorce,
not because it was, like,
toxic or terrible
but because suddenly
I had to deal with this thing
that had happened to me
in, like,
a three-dimensional way,
and I found myself
in a very dark place
and ultimately had
to summon the strength
to leave
and get to know myself
and find out
who that person is.
- I thought the only thing- that would be different
After 'The New York Times'
published my story
is that the rest of the world
- would have the information- I had.
What I did not anticipate
is that I would have
a new relationship
with this information,
which was essentially I had
- to process it- for the first time.
It was, like,
unmetabolized information.
Like, it's like
I'd swallowed it whole in 1995
and I had never actually
digested it.
You know, it was literally like
pressing play
on a movie that
I paused 22 years ago
in, like, the middle
of the scariest scene.
I'm just like, play.
I didn't even realize until
I read the 'New York Times'
article
that there was never even a CD.
I literally for 22 years
have wondered
what it was
and was it good
until I read the article
and realized...
- I mean,- read the article,
Met other survivors of his,
talked to...
Talked to them about
the traps he set.
It's like, 'Oh, my God.
There was no CD.'
There was never a CD.
It was all a ruse
to get me in there
- 'cause he knew I would- wanna hear the demo
And it was my job,
and that is why I walked right
into that trap
with Russell Simmons at 24.
- You're all I need
To get by
Aye
You're all I need
To get by
Aye
- Shorty, I'm there for you
anytime you need me
For real, girl, it's me
in your world, believe me
Nothing make a man
feel better than a woman
Queen with a crown
that be down for whatever
There are few things
that's forever, my lady
- We can make war- or make babies
Back when I was nothing
You made a brother feel
like he was something
That's why I'm with you to
this day, boo, no fronting
- You have to ask yourself,
you know,
where would her career
have gone in music?
What music did we lose?
What are we poorer for
for Drew not being
a music executive?
If this is what her 20s was,
the magic,
what would the next
20 years have been?
And we'll never know.
It's like we've been robbed
of that.
- When people get out, like, um,
for those kind of reasons,
I think that us as the public,
- we suffer because we don't know- what they could have produced
Or what they could have brought.
Like, maybe music wouldn't
have changed the way it did
if we had more women,
uh, in music.
- This is so emblematic
of what happens
to women routinely,
and we lose.
We all lose when
brilliant women go away,
when powerful women go away,
you know?
When people lose
their inner light,
that thing... when shame keeps you
from stepping up,
what... all of that,
it's a loss for all of us.
It really, really is.
- You know, I've had glimpses
of access to my creativity
and my joy
and my fearlessness,
but it's really been buried.
The most authentic part
of myself carried the pain,
so I couldn't...
I couldn't open that box.
- Would you rather hear a song
called 'Medicine' or 'Silver'?
- 'Medicine.'- Okay.
- Let me spell it out, babe,
I want you to go
All you do is try to teach me
things I've already known
Do you really think it helps
me having you in control
- There's a mom whose daughter
is in the 11th grade
- at my kids' school- and she read the article
- And thought- that I might be able
To give her daughter advice.
- The last thing I thought- would come from this article
Was having somebody want me
to help them with music.
I thought I was, like,
officially closing that door
whether I wanted to or not.
It's awesome.
I love it.
- Like, I love it.- You do?
- Yeah, so those are some
of my favorite verses of yours.
- Like...- Yeah?
- Of, like, all.- Really?
- I love those verses.
They're really haunting and,
like, I love them.
- Oh, thanks.
- Beautiful.
- Thank you.
And you can't wrap your mind
around my words
But your healing efforts
only make me hurt
Don't you know
You're not a medicine,
you're not a medicine
You gave me bad news
and I'm stuck in my bed again
You're not a medicine,
you're not a medicine
- I am excited
to be making music again.
I mean, it's sort of like...
It's like breathing.
- I feel like I've been holding- my breath for 16 years
And I didn't know it.
If you're a rape survivor,
you are the crime scene.
My life is the crime scene.
The crime doesn't end
the moment the assault ends.
The crime is perpetrated
and reperpetrated
every day that you
carry it with you,
and it informs your behavior,
so, like,
I'm a living crime scene.
And I realize now it was a cage.
I had no idea how much
this one night of my life
shattered me,
and until I said it out loud
and lived to, like,
tell the tale...
I'm still here...
I couldn't fully start to put
the pieces back together,
- and I would have- been shattered forever
If this Me Too moment
hadn't happened.
I mean, literally,
it's like... it saved my life.
I... it saved my life.
- These damnable heresies
Sold into slavery
By my insecurities
Oh, they keep
taking me down
Shaking me down
Taking me down
They keep breaking me down
Shaking me, taking me
Total hypocrisy
Teaching me lies
Spirituality
Through human eyes
Total confusion
No right or wrong
Keeping the people
From where they belong
Refusing to speak
Afraid to upset
Spending the rest
of your life
Oh, in total regret
This emotional force
Keeps conforming my mind
Keeping me blind,
keeping me blind
Keeping me blind
From the reality
Of what's being done, yeah
I keep playing the fool
To help everyone
These damnable heresies
Sold into slavery
By my insecurities
Oh, they keep
taking me down
Shaking me down,
down, down
Taking me down
They keep taking me,
breaking me
Making me
These damnable heresies
Sold into slavery
By my insecurities
Oh, they keep taking me
(SIGHS) Home.
Father!
Father!
Father!
Father!
Father! Father, it's me!
Come on, Father!
You are never going to believe where I've been!
Alice...
It all began with this white rabbit,
-and he wanted to take my hat and then... -Alice?
Is that really you?
Who else would I be?
You were gone a very long time.
We thought you were...
You thought I was what?
Dead.
ALICE'S FATHER: (FAINTLY) White rabbits, smoking caterpillars? Giant mushrooms?
Who does she think I am, a fool?
Why would she lie?
DR. LYDGATE: Your child is...
-She's delusional. -ALICE'S FATHER: She's making it up.
-DR. LYDGATE: But I can cure her of this. -So she's a liar.
DR. LYDGATE: She is a liar.
I'm not a liar. It was real.
And I'm going to prove it.
ASHLEY: Looks like you closed down the joint again, Leroy.
You're really gunning for that customer of the week plaque.
It's a win/win, Ashley. You get my mug on the wall,
I finally get... Whoa! Sorry, brother. Closing time.
It looks like a storm's coming. You better find a place to keep dry.
(BRITISH ACCENT) I'll get right on that.
There you are.
Bloody hell! What are you doing here?
I'll tell you on the way. We're late.
No, I'm not interested in your important dates, Rabbit,
or your unimportant dates, for that matter.
No, no, no, no. We're not late for something.
We're late for someone.
Who?
Alice.
She needs help.
You're the Knave of Hearts.
She needs you.
Answer the question, please.
Alice?
Alice?
I don't remember.
DR. LYDGATE: Oh, I think you do.
It's been a year now,
and you've been quite clear in your statements.
An invisible cat,
a hookah-smoking caterpillar,
food and drink capable of altering your physical form,
a murderous Red Queen.
And you encountered all these things by literally falling down a rabbit hole.
Hearing it out loud, it all sounds quite...
Preposterous. Wouldn't you agree, Alice?
Yes.
Good.
Just a few more questions,
and maybe this time, we can send you home.
When your father finally brought you to us,
he was at his wit's end.
It wasn't just your multiple disappearances
that had taken a toll.
It was your ludicrous explanation
that you'd been searching for proof of this place, this...
Wonderland where you had
miraculous, strange, and terrifying adventures.
Do you still believe that to be true?
Hey, that's mine.
Give it back.
GUARD #1: Trespasser! GUARD #2: Halt!
GUARD #1: She's headed into the maze!
GUARD #2: By order of the Queen, stop!
GUARD #1: Don't let her get away!
GUARD #2: She's headed for the Queen's garden!
After her!
GUARD #1: I thought she went this way!
She mustn't get away!
GUARD #1: (DISTORTED VOICE) Where's the girl?
GUARD #2: (DISTORTED VOICE) Has anyone seen her?
I thought she went this way!
DR. LYDGATE: Alice?
(SINGSONGY) Alice?
-(POUNDING DESK) -(NORMAL VOICE) Alice!
No.
It wasn't true.
I never left England.
So you just... Made it all up?
Why? For attention?
Well, you certainly got it, didn't you?
The question we have to answer today is,
which is the real performance?
Little girl with tales of tea parties and barbaric queens,
or the young lady who says it was just her imagination?
That little girl was a fool.
And the lady?
She knows what really happened.
GUARD #1: (DISTORTED VOICE) Search everywhere!
GUARD #2: (DISTORTED VOICE) She has to be here somewhere.
GUARD #1: (DISTORTED VOICE) There's no way out!
GUARD #2: (DISTORTED VOICE) Don't let her get away.
Where did she go?
CYRUS: What are you doing in my bottle?
Turn me in, and I get big.
Right here, right now, burst your house into a million shiny pieces.
We wouldn't want that now, would we?
Good bottles are so hard to find these days.
My name is Cyrus.
My home is your home.
DR. LYDGATE: When you finally resurfaced,
you claimed to be in this... Wonderland.
Can you tell us where you really were?
With a friend.
Where?
ALICE: Agrabah sounds beautiful.
I hope one day to see it again.
What place do you call home?
England.
Although it hasn't exactly felt like home lately.
So we're both strangers in this most strange land.
"Strange" is one word for it.
-Wondrous? -Dangerous.
I sense that you can take care of yourself.
And you have to go back to your land soon?
Well, I do have what I came for.
Which is what?
Proof that all this is real.
Oh! You want proof? Come here. I'll give you proof. Uhh!
A talking white rabbit in jacket and trousers?
(SIGHS) No one can say I imagined that.
Yes. That much is certain.
So tell me, Alice, who is this proof for?
You've risked much to come back here.
Is it... A husband?
No. There's no one like that.
Good.
Good?
I mean, just that you're not separated from your love.
That'd be a terrible fate.
Yes. That it would.
The proof is for my father.
He thinks I'm insane.
Really?
So you're risking your life for someone who doesn't believe in you?
You know...
When you really love someone,
you don't need proof.
You can feel it.
Maybe where you're from,
but in my land, I wish things would...
You wish things would what?
You found my bottle, Alice.
Anything is possible.
"Mistress mine, my will is thine.
"Tell me your wishes three."
Alice, if you wish to be released from this facility,
-you need to... -I don't wish for anything!
Would this have something to do with the genie you believe you met?
You told your father that you...
You set him free, that the two of you traveled
from world to world,
fighting pirates, swimming with mermaids.
And then,
men and women being what they are, you fell in love.
Are you ready to admit that that was a lie as well?
Curiouser and curiouser.
I've heard of the Boiling Sea,
but in person, it's even more amazing.
As are you.
Oh! Careful.
I've never met a human quite like you, Alice.
I've never met a genie quite like you.
Well, actually, I've never met a genie,
so... (CHUCKLES)
Okay.
Forgive me. I'm not used to...
I was always the one granting the wishes, not making them.
Making them? What?
For 100 years, I was tethered to a bottle,
a slave to the faulty dreams of man,
and all that time, I only had one wish.
To never be a prisoner again.
And now...
I have another.
Wait. I think the people in your world do this down on one...
Yes.
What?
Yes, yes, I will.
No, but I had a whole speech.
It was charming and eloquent and had...
Our hearts are entwined.
From now on, I'll know when you are near,
and you will know.
Alice, run!
DR. LYDGATE: When your father found you, you were inconsolable.
You said the love of your life was gone, murdered by some...
No, that's...
That's not what I said.
Alice, you were an ignored little girl
who wanted to be loved, so you created a fantasy land
full of characters who'd help you become
who you wanted to be. Tall, brave, beautiful.
You wouldn't be the first child to do this.
You're just the first to grow up and still believe it was real.
(WHISPERS) No.
(NORMAL VOICE) I don't believe it anymore.
We know you're lying.
You still cry out for him in your sleep.
-What? -In your sleep.
Every night, it's the same.
You cry out for Cyrus.
Sorry to interrupt.
Mind if I borrow him?
Cyrus, no!
Cyrus!
Alice!
Oops.
ALICE: Cyrus!
Cyrus!
No!
Cyrus.
DR. LYDGATE: Alice?
We have a new procedure that can take away your pain.
Make you forget whatever
or whomever you're holding on to.
One treatment.
It all just slips away.
Does it hurt?
A little.
But far less than the pain you're in right now.
Just sign here.
Good girl.
Now go get some sleep.
Tomorrow your life begins anew.
(WHISPERS) Cyrus.
It's time.
Fetch the girl.
Could you at least give me time to get dressed?
You.
"You"?
That's what I get?
"You"? Well, nice to see you, too, Alice.
What are you doing here?
Right. Come now. We have to go.
Go? Oh, no. You're not real.
Oh, I'm very real,
and we must leave now.
I've cleared out some of the guards, so we should be able to get out.
No, I can't. I can't.
Alice, you need to listen to me.
No, I'm not going anywhere.
Why must you always be so bloody stubborn?
There he is.
-I didn't do anything. -KNAVE: It's true.
I mean, if she was the least bit helpful, we'd be long gone by now. Ow!
Get him out of here.
Alice, no! You know me! You remember.
I don't want to remember. I want to forget.
Alice, listen to me.
-No! -He's alive.
The rabbit saw him. (GRUNTING)
Cyrus. He's alive.
That's impossible.
You know as well as I do, Alice.
(GRUNTS) Nothing's impossible in Wonderland.
Uhh!
Was that your idea of a rescue?
Well, it was supposed to be more of a message delivery type situation.
I wasn't planning to...
Right, let's go then.
You're late.
What a surprise.
To you, everybody's late.
True. I do have high standards.
Nice world you got here. Oh.
What the hell is this stuff? It's pretty hard on the paws.
Alice! Stop. Don't do this.
I can help you get better.
Are we really going to stand here and listen to this guy?
Seeing things, Doctor?
I hear there's a procedure for that.
(PANTING) Well, what do we do now?
We run.
Look out!
-(METAL CLANKING) -Out of the way!
-(WHISTLING) -KNAVE: Out of my way!
WHITE RABBIT: Oh, no.
We'll be pinched for sure.
No, we won't.
-They're coming. -Rabbit!
Here? Couldn't we find somewhere with softer ground, like a field...
BOTH: Dig!
All right.
Here goes.
What are you waiting for?
Alice, I didn't exactly leave that place on good terms.
-Neither did I, but if Cyrus is... -Then you have to go, not me.
Listen, Knave.
Once long ago, I got you back your heart.
Now, you need to help me get back mine.
MALE ORDERLY: (IN DISTANCE) Down there!
Or you can take your chances with them.
Bloody hell.
All right, then.
Next stop... Wonderland!
Aah!
Humans.
KNAVE: I hate...
This bloody...
Place!
Careful, Knave.
We've landed in the Mallow Marsh.
Of course we did,
because a pond made out of dessert topping makes perfect sense.
WHITE RABBIT: Come on. Shake a leg.
Shake two legs. (LAUGHS)
Ugh! What a mess.
Okay, rabbit. Where's Cyrus? Tell us where you saw him.
Well, I didn't exactly see him. Did you tell her I saw him?
-That is what you said. -It was a figure of speech.
Nope. I'm pretty sure it wasn't.
Uh, what I meant was,
I was having tea with the Dormouse, and he said that he saw him.
So we came all the way here on the word of a narcoleptic rodent?
Ignore him, Rabbit. Go on.
He said Cyrus was at the Mad Hatter's old place.
It's abandoned. The Hatter, he hasn't been in Wonderland for some time.
And he ain't never coming back.
He's found himself a nice little life back in the place I was makin' mine...
-A place, I might add... -(ROARS)
Where the dragonflies aren't actually dragons.
Rabbit, are you getting taller?
Yeah, quite possibly. That kind of thing happens
quite a lot around here.
We're sinking.
I can't move me feet.
Rabbit, where is it? Where's the Hatter's house?
Where else? The Tulgey Woods.
Knave, we need to get out of here.
-(GURGLING SOUND) -Really?
Uh, everything's gonna be fine.
I'll just, uh... Uh, uh, I'll go get help!
Don't worry! Everything's going to work out just fine!
Stop moving. We'll just sink faster.
Oh, because a slow death is so much more pleasant.
This is humiliating.
I'm gonna die like a bloody s'more.
A what?
It's biscuits and chocolate, and you get toasted marsh...
Never mind. The point is, we're gonna die.
Knave, that's brilliant.
-(ROARING) -What the bloody hell are you doing?
-I'm making a sore. -S'mores!
Whatever.
I'm starting to think you were in the nutter for a reason.
See?
Come on.
Where's that rabbit?
It's getting late, and I plan on sleepin' in me own bed tonight.
You can't leave. We haven't found Cy...
Cyrus. Exactly.
You heard what the rabbit said.
He never even saw him.
If I'd known that, I wouldn't have done any of this.
I mean, for all we know, he isn't even alive.
What if he is?
Alice...
I left Wonderland because I did a lot of bad things here.
A lot of people wanna see me dead.
They have their reasons, and to be honest,
they're good reasons.
(SIGHS) I left this place for a future I'm quite keen to see,
and you want me to risk all that for a hunch?
I can pay you.
How?
You don't have anything to pay me, Alice.
That's not entirely true.
I have something better than money.
Wishes.
I don't get it.
Why don't you just use 'em to bring Cyrus back?
Wishes can be... Unpredictable.
If I used one to bring Cyrus back,
he might arrive hanging from a tree with a noose around his neck.
See, with wishes,
sometimes there's literally a string attached.
Then one just has to be careful what they wish for.
Make it consequence-proof.
Yeah, I can do that.
So does that mean you'll stay?
We find Cyrus, I get a wish.
Anything I want.
Just get me to Tulgey Woods.
You really believe the Rabbit, then?
I know you have your doubts, but, yes, I believe the Rabbit.
Oh, no.
Huh. Oh.
-There you are, Rabbit. -Oh!
My ears!
Oh! Uhh! Do you mind? (GRUNTS)
(PANTING) Your Majesty, I can explain.
You're late.
I know. I know. I'm so sorry.
I came as soon as I could.
So you told Alice what you heard?
Yes, that Cyrus was alive. Is he?
I'll be the one asking questions.
Right. So this makes us all square then?
You said if I got her here, I'd get...
I said we'd settle up when the game was complete.
We are still setting up the board.
Now as for your friend Alice,
I need you to report everything she does,
where she goes, who she talks to, what she is thinking.
I need more than my eyes.
I need your ears,
and you will either help me, darling...
Or decorate this room.
Understood?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Now leave.
The Tulgey Woods.
The Hatter's place is on the other side.
Aren't you worried this is all a trap?
If there's a chance that Cyrus is alive,
we have to take it.
Right. Let's go.
KNAVE: The Red Queen.
You said it was also her who threw Cyrus into the Boiling Sea.
Why would she do that?
ALICE: I don't know, but I'd love to ask her
and see the look on her face when she realizes
I'm not the forgiving sort,
particularly when said face meets this branch, repeatedly.
Doesn't sound like you.
The Doctor said I'm a danger to myself and to others.
Yeah, you can't believe everything you read now.
ALICE: I don't.
In fact, when I thought Cyrus was dead,
I stopped believing in much of anything.
JAFAR: Well?
She's back.
And what is the girl doing now?
Looking for her genie, of course.
Isn't that what we wanted, Jafar?
What we want can't be accomplished until we have the genie's bottle
and the girl's made all her wishes.
So I'd say
perhaps you shouldn't be so pleased with yourself.
Do not talk down to me, Jafar. I'm the Queen.
That's the thing about power.
Hmm. It can be so fleeting.
(SCOFFS) is that a threat?
No.
Threats are for people who aren't prepared to act.
-(STAFF THUDS) -Wait.
You need me.
Not anymore.
But I did what you could not. I...
I brought Alice back to Wonderland.
Which means your work
and your usefulness to me is done.
I'll take it from here.
(WEAKLY) Do you know...
(STRAINED VOICE) Where she is?
Do you?
That's right.
You don't.
Now you're not in Agrabah anymore, darling.
This is my world,
which means only I know exactly where she is.
Only I know exactly where she's going.
So if you want my help,
yes... Our deal remains.
I will get you those wishes.
In return for what, exactly?
All in due time.
So why don't you get on that raggedy carpet of yours
and fly away?
And let me take care of Alice.
For your sake...
I hope you do.
ALICE: We've been walking forever.
We should be at the Hatter's house by now.
KNAVE: Oh, bloody hell.
What exactly did you do after I left?
Don't ask.
Now which way?
Up.
I'm tired of wandering around.
We need a different point of view.
What do you mean?
If I get high enough, I can see the Hatter's house.
Enough of these.
I can see it! The Hatter's place... It's not that far!
Knave?
Will?
Cheshire. It's you.
You gave me a fright.
Chesh?
You remember me, right?
It's Alice.
Yes, I remember.
You look different.
Everything does, doesn't it?
Wonderland has grown stranger.
I'm stranger. You're stranger.
Together we are... Strangers.
Well, then... How do you do?
Now that we're friends again,
you wouldn't want to eat a friend now...
Would you?
Mmm, certainly not without pepper.
The pickings are slimmer these days.
These woods used to be full of food,
but now the only thing it's full of...
Is you!
The Red Queen promised
you would be the sweetest meat I've ever tasted.
Let's see, shall we?
(GROWLING)
Now then...
Go pick on somebody your own size.
I can't believe it.
You. You were...
Brave?
Daring?
Stealing my wishes.
Oh, that.
I think maybe you misunderstand.
I was just protecting the wishes.
You expect me to believe that?
Not really, no.
But can we focus on the part where I came back
and saved your life?
You know, you can't steal a wish.
It has to be granted.
Of course I did.
Everybody knows that.
Let's go get Cyrus.
Knave. (PANTING)
Over there! Hurry!
Cyrus!
(PANTING) The Hatter's house.
Cyrus.
Cyrus!
Cyrus!
Cyrus.
I'm here.
Alice.
He must be here. It's too dark to tell,
or maybe he's sleeping or something.
-(DOOR OPENS) -Oh, here you are.
I've been looking all over.
I showed up with a whole troop to pull you out of that marsh,
but you were gone.
It's okay, Rabbit. Just dig us back home.
Cyrus ain't here.
No, he must be here.
Alice...
Alice.
I'm sorry.
But he's not here.
And as far as I can tell, he never was.
WHITE RABBIT: Maybe...
Maybe the Dormouse just named the wrong house, or...
Rabbit, enough.
If Cyrus were here, wouldn't he have shown himself by now?
So he really is gone.
Alice.
You made her lose Cyrus twice.
Why would you do that?
ALICE: Will, Rabbit, come quickly!
I found this. It was Cyrus's.
Where did you get that?
It was just here in the grass.
He's alive.
Nothing could survive the Boiling Sea.
If it survived, so did he.
Alice, that necklace, it's magic.
That's why it survived.
The guy wearing it, he was just flesh and blood.
He's gone.
I'm sorry.
Now let's get out of here.
The Rabbit can dig his hole.
You can make a new life, meet somebody else.
-No. -No?
I'm not going.
Alice, this isn't the time to be stubborn.
I'm not being stubborn.
Yes, you are.
If you want to leave, leave.
But I'm staying.
Because of a necklace?
Because he's here.
But you have no proof.
When you really love someone,
you don't need proof.
You can feel it.
He's here.
I'm gonna find him.
Only question is...
Are you coming with me?
I was afraid you were going to ask me that.
Is that a "yes"?
Bloody hell.
Come on, then.
(WHISPERS) Alice.
No!
WHITE RABBIT: No one believed Alice when she spoke of her adventures in Wonderland.
Of how she fell in love with a genie named Cyrus,
-and how the Red Queen tore them apart. -No!
She was locked away in an asylum.
Alice. She needs help.
So the Knave of Hearts and I brought her back to Wonderland
to search for her true love.
He's here. I can feel it.
There are those who will try to stop her.
What we want can't be accomplished until the girl's made all her wishes.
But Alice's greatest adventure has just begun.
Can I help you?
We shall soon find out.
You are Farzeen Shahmed?
You work in the marketplace selling scarves.
Yes. Uh... Would you like one?
May I?
Oh.
You earn very little income, and yet your home is well-appointed.
Thank you.
It was not a compliment, but an observation.
You have a bounty of fresh vegetables in your garden.
And I couldn't help noticing you have two camels outside.
Few men in Agrabah can afford even one,
and yet here you are with two.
-I have been very fortunate. -Indeed.
It seems you have everything a man could possibly wish for.
Perhaps you've met someone who could grant them,
wishes.
I am not sure what you mean.
My good fortune is due to a family investment
that has finally began to pay off.
Is that so?
-Yes. -(KETTLE WHISTLING)
I can explain further if you'll allow me to turn off the stove.
Yes.
Yes. We wouldn't want you to overcook water.
Go on.
-(WHISPERS) Genie. -(WHOOSHING)
Master mine, my will is thine.
(WHISPERING) He is here. The one you spoke of.
The man with the serpent staff.
Steady. It's not you who he's after.
-My third wish. I want it now. -Have patience. I can help you.
-I wish you gone. -Don't.
As far from Agrabah as the earth from the sun.
No!
Where did you send him?
I don't know. (CHOKING) Please.
What is it you desire?
Just mercy.
Well, then...
It seems neither of us are going to get what we want today.
(EXHALES) Where am I?
What the bloody hell?
Good, you're up.
(GROANS) What are you doing?
I'm getting ready. I'm a bit rusty.
There. Now you've gone and hurt the tree. Happy?
I'll be happy once we get Cyrus back.
We need to get moving.
We've been in Wonderland for too long. Our enemies know we're here.
"Our enemies"? Who would they be?
Excellent question. Come on.
-(KNAVE GROANS) -I have a plan, Knave.
-And a new outfit. Where'd you get that? -Hmm.
-The clotheshorse came by. -Of course it did.
Our biggest problem is we don't know where Cyrus is.
He could be trapped somewhere or, or captured.
Any chance of a coffee horse coming by?
-I can't really think until... -But then I realized...
We don't need to know where he is.
-Oh, we don't? -Because we know something...
Something nobody else does.
We know where the bottle is hidden.
I'm not sure you're clear on what the word "we" means.
It's a two-step plan. Step one, we find the bottle.
Step two, we make three harmless wishes.
And no matter where he is, he'll just get drawn back inside.
You said there's no such thing as a harmless wish.
True, that's if you wish for something big.
But if you wish for something small and innocent,
like a cupcake, it should be fine.
Which, um, brings us to you.
-Here it comes. -You'll rub the bottle,
and Cyrus will reappear and we'll be together again.
And then we'll figure out a way to truly free him once and for all.
Um, Alice...
Once I rub the bottle doesn't that make Cyrus my genie?
(SIGHS) I guess I'll just have to trust you.
Right, then. Where do we find this bottle?
We buried it in the Mimsy Meadows.
Under the towering Tum Tum Tree.
It's a place where nobody goes.
With a name like that, why would they? Unless they were a Care Bear.
-What's a Care Bear? -(WHITE RABBIT SNORING)
Never mind.
-You want to wake him or should I? -(SNORING CONTINUES)
Leave him be. Poor Rabbit's been through enough.
Which is Alice-speak for, "He's slowing us down."
ALICE: Come on, Knave. Time to get the bottle.
Time to get Cyrus.
(GASPS) Alice?
What's going on over there? You all right?
One at a time.
-Her Majesty demands order. -(OPERA PLAYING)
-The water supply's running out. -My crops are dying.
Please help us.
Darlings, can I be honest with you?
Your problems bore me.
Dear Jafar...
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
I don't know how you can stand to listen to them.
Day in, day out.
I'm the Queen.
It's my job.
It's your flaw. You were trying to earn their respect.
All you have to do is take it.
I took this throne. I took Wonderland.
And yet, still it's not enough, is it?
I think if either of us were satisfied with what we already had,
we wouldn't be messing about with Alice and her genie, now, would we?
If you can't find that bottle for me,
then maybe this is just a waste of time.
Actually, I am more concerned
whether it is you who can do what you say you can.
With the bottle's power...
Will you indeed be able to change the laws of magic?
To make the impossible...
Possible.
You must have some truly unholy desires.
Oh, that I do.
Can you do it?
Of course, but this talk is foolishly premature until we have the bottle.
So why don't you stop wasting time with these peasants
and focus on the task in hand.
Whether I like it or not, Jafar, I am the Queen,
I have responsibilities.
There.
I've cleared your day.
Now find the bottle so I can get Alice to make those wishes...
And you can have your Tweedles sweep her up, too.
ALICE: Keep up would you? We're making good time.
(PANTING) If we keep at this pace
we'll arrive at Mimsy Meadows before midday.
You may want to lower your voice.
The walls in this place have ears, literally.
There are walls with actual ears.
We don't want the whole of Wonderland to know where we're going.
(SIGHS) Of course not.
You're thinking about what happens if we find him?
When.
When we find him.
What if it's nothing like you thought?
-(SWORD CLANKS) -Meaning?
Well, I just think to protect yourself,
you should consider the possibility that things may be different.
You've been gone a long time.
Cyrus is waiting for me. He needs me.
Then why hasn't he contacted you?
If you know where he is, surely he knows where you are, too.
The only reason he hasn't contacted me is because he must be in trouble.
That's why we need to pick up the pace.
Or he's moved on.
Not a chance. What Cyrus and I have...
Well, you wouldn't understand.
No. I suppose I wouldn't.
Nothing will get in the way of us being together.
Except possibly this.
Harder.
Harder. Harder!
-(CLEARS THROAT) Uh... -Bunny!
What news do you have for me?
Everything is moving along as you predicted.
They left this morning to get the genie's bottle.
So you know where it is, then.
Uh, I, uh...
Need I remind you of the consequences if you lie to me?
Uh, no. Uh... (SIGHS) I know exactly where it is.
I suppose we could swim across.
No, we can't.
If you're afraid of dangers lurking beneath the surface,
-I can handle... -I can't swim.
How have you lived your whole life and never...
-I was doing other things. -Like what?
Like being afraid of water, Alice.
Fine. We'll just have to wait for the ferry.
Or better idea. We walk... We walk around it.
Walk around the entire thing?
That would take two days at least.
We're taking the ferry.
Oh.
There she is.
ALICE: Over here, fairy.
I am the fairy Silvermist. Where may I...
I...
Heya, Silv.
-Uhh. -How's it going?
-There it is. -I take it you know each other.
Awfully bold of you to show your face in Wonderland.
Do you know how many people are looking for you?
Might be easier to figure out how many aren't.
You think you're funny?
I think I'm buggered no matter what I say right now.
Perhaps you two might continue reminiscing while we make our way across the lake.
(WHISPERS) I think we have to walk.
Not at all. I'm happy to take you.
The both of us? Are you sure?
Of course. It's my job, and I'm a professional.
I don't let feelings get in the way of my work,
especially old feelings that I've completely moved on from.
-Okay. Thank you very much. -Mmm.
-(NUDGES) -Yeah, thank you very much.
(EXHALES) Excellent. Well, then,
we need to get to the Tum Tum Tree in Mimsy Meadows.
What? I need to tell her where we're going.
Don't worry. You can trust me.
I'm here to help.
That burn you got from the bars...
I'm starting to understand why yours is the only cage made of silver.
Is that to keep you from escaping?
It's to keep me from even thinking of escaping.
Genies and silver... We don't mix.
Perhaps we can take your mind off the pain.
Last move was rook to D3.
Sorry, old man. I can't play with you today.
You have something better to do? (CHUCKLES)
Yes.
Actually... I do.
Mistress mine, my will is thine.
Open your hand.
-What? -Your hand. Open it.
What are these?
They're your wishes.
Ah, they're so pretty.
As are you.
(CLEARS THROAT) Forget about me?
Oh. Sorry, Rabbit.
Oh. (GRUNTS)
No hard feelings?
No, I suppose it's my fault.
I never should have led you down here in the first place.
It's been nothing but trouble for you.
You didn't lead me here. I followed you.
WHITE RABBIT: You always were a curious girl.
Good luck, Alice.
So what happens now?
Anything.
Everything.
So I can wish for anything I want?
Ah. There are a few restrictions.
The laws of magic, as it were.
-Laws of magic? -Yes.
There are four of them. I can't kill anyone.
I can't bring anything back from the dead.
I can't change the past.
And I can't make anyone fall in love.
Reasonable enough.
After the third wish, what happens then?
I get returned to my bottle,
and then someone else finds me.
-So you spend your entire life... -Serving at the pleasure of my masters.
Yes.
What if I wish...
For your freedom?
It's been tried,
and it's never gone well for either party.
Wishes come with a cost, Alice.
The bigger the wish, the greater the consequence.
Sounds dangerous.
I get the feeling you like a little danger.
-(CHUCKLES) -You're still not sure what to wish for.
Perhaps we could...
Take a walk.
I can give you some suggestions.
I'd like that very much.
I must admit, I do enjoy the flying.
You always did.
For what it's worth, Sil,
I enjoyed some of the other bits as well.
Not nearly as much as I'm going to enjoy this.
-(SCREAMING) -(GASPS) Will!
I can't tell you how long I've been waiting for that.
-How could you... -Trust me. He deserved it.
But we have to get him. He can't swim.
Sorry. No detours.
Oh, bloody hell.
-(GRUNTS) -(GASPS) Oh.
(GASPING) Help.
What did you do to that fairy?
What did I do to her? She just tossed me into the bloody lake!
Which you clearly deserved.
Now we're stuck in the middle of nowhere,
all because you broke a fairy's heart.
Well, she shouldn't have given it away in the first place.
People can't help falling in love, Will.
Sure, they can. You just sneak out in the middle of the night,
grab your trousers, your keys, and don't ever look back.
How did you get this way?
-Who did this to you? -This isn't about me, Alice.
If it were, I'd be sat back at home, happily watching the telly.
Don't ask.
Look, all I'm trying to tell you is,
you've got this picture of Cyrus in your mind,
these perfect little memories of how things were.
But maybe that's just how they were for you.
It wasn't like that.
And if you really believe that,
what are we doing here?
This is your quest, Alice, not mine.
I'm in it for the wish,
just like everybody else looking for a genie.
Is something wrong?
You seem a little on edge.
Sorry.
Being a genie is a lot like being a wanted man.
Someone's always after you.
-(PAPER RUSTLING) -Do you know who that "someone" is?
At the moment, a man called Jafar.
He carries this staff with the head of a serpent.
If you ever see him...
What?
Well, let's just hope you never do.
What does he want with you?
What everyone wants. What they don't have.
You don't have to stay out here on my account.
-If you're safe in bottle, you should... -No.
This is the closest thing I've had to freedom in a long time.
I could say the same.
If your home is such a prison,
why make it your mission to return?
(SIGHS) I have nowhere else to go.
You have the whole world, Alice.
I can show it to you.
-All you have to do is wish. -But I have more questions.
What else would you like to know?
Everything.
The people you've met, the things you've done.
Have you ever slain a dragon?
Once. I can't recommend it.
-(GASPS) -It required some deft swordplay.
I've never been comfortable with a sword.
You've never felt comfortable with a sword?
Then how have you survived here all of this time?
There's other ways to fight.
And in Wonderland, you just have to be...
Creative. (CHUCKLES)
Like this?
It's beautiful.
And it actually smells like a rose.
It's magic paper.
A little something I picked up on my travels.
You've traveled a lot, I take it.
Indeed. It's the price of many masters.
I'm never in one place very long.
They make their wishes, and then they just...
Move on.
I'm afraid I know the feeling.
I know what it's like to be moved on from.
I find it hard to imagine anyone wanting to move on from you.
Amazing.
-Can you teach me? -An origami lesson shall be yours.
Actually...
I meant the swordplay.
The genie's bottle.
You have knowledge of its whereabouts.
Dispensing of pleasantries so early on in our relationship?
How tragic.
This is not a relationship,
and I'm a very busy man.
So you keep saying.
Yet it appears to me that I am the one doing all the work.
I brought Alice back to Wonderland,
and I found out where the bottle is hidden.
Where?
I'm happy to share that information with you, Jafar.
But first, I feel like we need a little chat.
I have needs.
Before I am happy to play another hand in the game,
I need proof that you can satisfy them.
What you need, my girl...
Is to be quiet.
What you need...
Is to be still.
Silent. Follow orders.
Most of all, be grateful for the air I'm allowing you to breathe.
We're not partners.
I don't owe you anything.
I have given you my word,
and that is more than most ever receive. Is that clear?
Oh.
Let me help you with that.
Is that clear?
Tell me where the bottle is.
Mimsy Meadows,
beneath the towering Tum Tum Tree.
See?
We make a wonderful team.
We're never gonna make it there.
It's miles and miles away.
True. This is a bit of a setback, I'll give you that.
But I'm sure we'll find another way.
-How? -Give me a minute.
-Two minutes. -We don't have two minutes, Will.
We need to get there today! (STOMPS)
-Oh! -What the bloody hell was that, then?
(GRUNTS) I don't know.
What kind of an island is this?
This isn't an island.
What?
-(SWORD ZINGS) -Hold on tight.
-Tight? To what? -Anything.
-Alice! -(RUMBLING)
Did that tickle?
-A turtle? -If you want to keep your head, I suggest
-you take me where I want to go! -(ROARING)
Good boy.
Now go!
For someone who's not comfortable with a sword,
you're quite good.
I must get one of these someday.
No, that's not a wish.
Now all you have to do is learn how to use it.
Well done. Now loosen your grip.
You're holding it like a street fighter.
Better. Have you always been such a quick study?
I learned how to play Mozart's Sonata in C in under a week.
Amazing. How?
(GRUNTS) My mother used to play. Or so I was told.
She died when I was born.
I thought if I learnt to play like her,
it would make my father happy.
Did it?
It's hard to be happy again when you've lost someone you love.
Sorry.
(SIGHS) I didn't mean to.
Don't be.
(GASPS) Hey!
(GASPS) What do I do now?
Same thing you've always done.
Be creative.
It's hard to be creative when your opponent's uncommonly creative, too.
Well, I suppose the trick is to always be smarter than your opponent.
Which means you have to know who you're up against.
I'll remember that.
So, Alice, what now?
I think I know my opponent.
I think I know his weakness.
Really?
I hope so.
Looks like I was right.
What are you waiting for?
I nearly drowned and was eaten by a mock turtle.
Can I have a moment, please?
-(SIGHS) -SILVERMIST: Nope.
-You again? -I'm actually glad
to see you alive, Knave.
That's strange, since you're the one that tried to kill me.
That was before I heard about the bounty on your head.
Turns out you're in pretty deep to the Caterpillar.
Okay, look. I made a horrible mistake.
The thing is, you were right about everything.
I felt bloody awful after what happened between us.
If you ever had a heart, I don't know what happened to it.
But then again, maybe your precious Anastasia used it all up.
You're right.
I don't feel terrible.
Not even a little bit.
But that's because I don't feel much of anything anymore.
So why don't we both agree
that I'm a right bastard and go our separate ways?
We don't need to bring the Caterpillar into this.
-Why should I care about your fate? -You shouldn't.
But care about hers.
She's a decent person, and so is the man that she loves,
whose life is literally hanging in the balance as we speak.
Don't make the good guys pay for the bad guys' mistakes.
I am sorry, Silvermist. For everything.
Be on with you, then.
-Really? -Get out of here. Go.
Was that you apologizing?
It happens. Don't dwell on it.
Come on.
So who's Anastasia?
Nobody.
Well, in any case, thank you.
Good morning.
All the mornings are good since I've met you.
So what should we do today?
You mentioned that place, the Boiling Sea.
-I've always wanted to... -Alice.
I think it's time.
-For what? -For you to make your wishes.
Did I do something wrong?
No.
In fact, I can't imagine you ever doing anything wrong.
Which is the problem.
I don't understand.
I'm falling in love with you, Alice.
-Cyrus... -I can't allow that to happen.
Because at some point, you're going to
make your wishes and move on with your life.
And while I've gotten used to being alone inside this bottle for years at a time,
the thought of spending an eternity there without you...
It's too much for me to bear.
But if I don't make my wishes,
you'll never go back inside.
Everyone makes their wishes.
-I won't. -You say that now,
but I've lived countless lifetimes and no one has ever not made their wishes.
Why would I wish for anything?
I have everything I could possibly wish for.
You are everything I've ever wished for, Cyrus.
What if you change your mind?
-I won't. -But what if you do?
You just have to trust me.
How about we make a deal?
I'll never move on from you
if you never move on from me.
What do you propose we do with this?
We bury it.
Find the bottle.
Wait for me!
-You can't just go running... -(SHUSHING)
What is it?
We've got company.
I'm sorry, Alice. We're too late.
Actually, we're just in time.
What do you mean?
He's about to finish digging.
Let him.
The bottle's not here.
-Huh? -Never was.
Then, um... Then, then why are we here?
I wanted to know who we're up against, and now I do.
(WHISPERING) So that's why you kept telling everybody where we're headed.
The one thing you can count on in Wonderland
is that you can't count on anyone.
You are clever.
ALICE: His name is Jafar.
- Do you know him? - I know of him .
Wait a second.
You didn't tell me the bloody truth, either.
Does that mean you don't trust me?
Well...
If it helps, I do now.
Which is why you're coming with me.
Where?
To where the bottle is really hidden.
Passage made of peas.
Tower of tigers.
The windmill. This is it.
-KNAVE: Mmm! -And there's the dandelion!
These actually aren't half bad.
You're lucky no one came along and ate your bloody landmark.
No.
It's impossible.
The bottle, it's gone.
What you said before...
Maybe you were right.
Maybe he's moved on.
(GASPS) Find her.
Get up!
On your feet, genie.
What do you want?
-(GROANS) -Where is it?
-What? -You know what.
The bottle.
-Where is it? -Go ahead. Kill me.
I don't have to kill you.
I'll kill her... In front of you,
unless you tell me where the bottle is immediately.
-RED QUEEN: I have it. -(GROANING AND PANTING)
Very good advice you gave me this morning.
There was I thinking I needed to earn your respect,
when really all I needed to do was to take it.
You have the bottle?
Stop underestimating me, Jafar.
Very nice dungeon you have here.
I can really see you enjoy dankness.
Remind me to tell you the value of keeping pretty things around.
Well... Mmm.
There's one.
Tell me where it is.
How about we start with changing the game?
Beginning with a new rule, do not talk down to me anymore!
You see, I was planning on telling you where the bottle was hidden.
And then I realized something. I don't trust you.
And the reason I don't trust you, because
this relationship is not mutually beneficial.
What with you holding all the cards and me holding nothing.
But all that's changed now, hasn't it, darling?
You have the genie...
And I have the bottle.
He's moved on.
It's the only thing that makes sense.
Cyrus and I were the only two people in the world
that knew where that bottle was.
Or you weren't. Are you positive that you never mentioned...
Yes!
Maybe this whole thing was a fool's errand, and I'm the fool.
Alice, we should get some shelter. It's not safe here.
Who cares?
Alice?
WHITE RABBIT: Everything went well, then?
Very well, thank you.
So, then...
Yes?
All due respect, Your Majesty, I, I fulfilled my obligations.
I, I went above and beyond the call of duty.
It's true.
Indeed you did.
And you promised me that if
-I, uh... -Promises were made to be broken.
As are the bones of little bunnies who forget what they have at stake.
Now, for the last time,
when I get what I want, you will get what you want.
Why is it such a difficult concept for everyone?
Now tell me...
How did you really know where that bottle was hidden?
-You never did say. -I... I saw them...
Before we do this, understand, life with me will not be easy.
-Life without you hasn't been easy. -You'll always have to keep
one eye over your shoulder. Someone will always be coming.
Do you truly believe that love is powerful enough to give us our freedom?
I believe ours is.
-Do you? Because if you don't... -Alice, I've told you,
I will never leave you.
What are you waiting for?
(SCOFFS) Crazy kids.
Honey! Sorry I'm late!
Please go to sleep.
I can't. You sleep.
How can I sleep if you insist on thinking so loudly?
I'm sorry, Alice.
I put that terrible idea in your head.
Don't listen to me, love.
I don't know nothing about it.
I think you do.
Who's Anastasia?
That is a tale of heartbreak.
Yours or hers?
Either way, does it matter?
So there. You got me.
I do know something about love.
But that doesn't mean I'm right about you two.
Do you believe that he truly loves you? Cyrus?
I did.
Well, that's good then.
Because when somebody truly loves you, they can never move on.
My father did.
I'm sorry?
He loved me, and he moved on.
And now it's happening again.
What the bloody hell is that?
Proof.
-(CHUCKLES) -CYRUS: My dearest Alice,
It took several lifetimes to meet you,
but only seconds to love you.
And it is a love that cannot be broken.
Not by a thousand spells or swords.
So it is with my heart in your hands...
-(KEY TURNS) -...that I ask you grant me one wish.
Leave Wonderland.
You're not safe here,
and you cannot save me.
The only thing worse than my own demise would be knowing that I have caused yours.
I beg you to go home.
And know that I am with you always.
Forever thine, forever mine...
Cyrus.
He's alive.
I thought when you truly loved somebody, you didn't need any proof.
You don't,
but it's still nice to have.
Hi. My name's Orion.
I'm a kid, just like you, so we have that in common.
Anyhow, I saw you sitting there by yourself
and thought maybe you'd like some company.
I know I would.
So that's why I'm walking up to you right now and...
Walking right past you.
Why, you ask?
Because, Sally,
I'm afraid.
Afraid of what, you want to know? So much, really.
But in this case, rejection, humiliation...
that you might tell your friends, and they would all laugh at me.
And it's not just you I'm afraid of, Sally.
And not just girls in general.
It's most things, to be candid.
Oh, it's tuna. What do you have?
It would be kinda nice to know.
The school counselor told me to document my fears in some form.
That's why I keep a sketchbook.
It's my way of trying to manage my issues.
Take page 14, for example. My fear of clogging the toilet...
...and flooding the whole entire school.
Oh, thank God.
I'm also afraid of giving the wrong answer in class.
Who can tell me which explorer first reached India by sea?
- Me, me, me! - A tricky situation.
Mrs. Spinoza usually calls on kids who don't raise their hands.
But raising my hand so she won't call on me is a dangerous strategy.
Therefore I try to look invisible. But at the same time, not too invisible.
I know the answer is Vasco da Gama.
It's the answer to a great many questions in the fifth grade,
but I'm afraid if called on, I might say "Gasco da Vama",
or "Dasco ga Vama."
Everyone would laugh.
Oh, Mrs. Spinoza, I know!
Yes? Lisa?
- Vasco da Gama. - Very good, Lisa.
I'm not a real big fan of Lisa.
But to be fair,
there are a lot of things I'm not a big fan of.
Murderous gutter clowns are high on my list.
Cell phone waves giving me cancer.
Hi, Grandma.
Mosquito bites getting infected.
Falling off a skyscraper.
- Saying "good morning." - "Goob dorning!"
Bees. Dogs. The ocean.
I'm afraid of being responsible for my team losing.
Hey, Orion, catch!
And of course, I'm afraid of locker rooms.
Because A, what sane person isn't?
You okay, Gabe?
And B...
...Richie Panici.
Well, well, well, look who it is. Cryin' Orion!
Hey, Richie.
Wear pants much?
I'm afraid of being humiliated by Richie Panici.
Afraid of being punched by him.
Also, I'm afraid of... Okay, what if I punch him back?
And his nose goes into his brain, and he dies.
That can happen, the nose and the brain thing. Look it up.
I'll go to juvie.
Plus, I'll have to live with the guilt of...
Hey! I asked if you wear pants much. Don't be rude.
Yes, I do wear pants.
Much?
What's that pad you always got?
"I'm afraid of monsters, bees, haircuts, dogs...
the ocean, Richie Panici..." Hey! I'm famous! Thanks!
Wait. You drew me dead! No one draws me dead!
I'm hereby "consificating" this on account of its rudeness to me,
Richie Panici.
If I weren't so scared, I would tell you that that's my property.
That I put my heart and soul into it,
and that you had no right to grab it from me.
I would also tell you that the word is "confiscating."
Thank you, Richie.
- Huh? - Huh?
Whatever.
I don't know why I thanked him.
Have a great weekend, everyone.
Oh, and don't forget to leave your permission slips on my desk.
The bus for the planetarium leaves on Monday at nine a.m. sharp.
Oh, no. I was hoping Mrs. Spinoza would've forgotten about the field trip.
Ah, this is gonna be so fun!
Fun? It sounds fun to you, Lisa?
Are you insane? This field trip sounds terrifying.
Getting packed like sardines into a rusty school bus
with 30 other kids speeding down the highway?
Sounds like a traffic accident waiting to happen.
I should know.
I've studied the actuarial charts.
And all those giant models of our solar system hanging from the ceiling?
I mean, how long have those things been up there?
A hundred years?
Plus, what if I end up having to sit next to Sally at the planetarium,
and our hands touch?
I'll have a panic attack.
It'll become a running joke around the school,
and I'll never know the joy of a meaningful human connection!
Orion, do you have your permission slip?
I was afraid she was gonna say that.
Um, my parents won't let me go to the planetarium.
Yeah, they don't believe in, uh, space.
Yeah, um, it's a whole thing.
She's over here.
Hey, Orion.
I'm super excited for the field trip.
So, um, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to sit together?
While we're there?
If I weren't so scared, I'd tell you, "Of course I do, Sally.
Of course I wanna hang out with you.
To be frank, I've never wanted anything more, but to do that,
I'd have to be able to not constantly obsess over every negative thing
that could possibly happen..."
Oh, that's my mom. I gotta go.
See you at the planetarium, Orion!
No, you won't.
Page 17 in my sketch book.
I'm afraid my parents will move away while I'm at school.
I don't know why I fear this.
The counselor at school doesn't have any theories.
My parents certainly seem nice enough, he says.
And I think he's correct.
Hi, honey!
- Hi, Mom. - How was school?
- Fine. - I made you oatmeal cookies.
how'd that get there?
Your father found it stuffed under the couch.
I think you mean in between the couch cushions?
- Hm. Wanna talk about it? - Not really.
You should go. It'll be fun.
I'm not so sure about that.
Orion, bud, I get it.
These kind of things can be scary.
But that's the thing. It's okay to be nervous.
More than okay, in fact. It's normal.
The trick is not to let your fear get in the way of living your life.
It's true.
Otherwise, I never would've proposed.
Sometimes, you just have to feel the fear and do it anyway.
I love my parents, and I appreciate
what they're trying to do, but...
that is, without question, the worst advice I've ever heard.
It looks like this is the end of the line for us, guys.
Oh, no. This is terrible.
This cartoon is completely unrealistic.
Recyclable items do not have eyes or personalities.
They do not go on adventures. I don't appreciate being condescended to.
Real life is way more complicated than that.
- And reincarnation is wishful thinking. - Wow!
For plastic containers and people.
In real life, when you're dead, you're dead.
The realization that there's no way around it terrifies me.
I try to imagine what death is like. I've concluded it's like nothing.
I try to imagine nothing. This is black and silent, not nothing.
Blackness and silence is something.
Nothing is perhaps the one unimaginable thing.
Orion!
- All tucked in? - Yes.
- Teeth brushed? - Uh-huh.
All right, buddy. Sleep well.
Goodnight, Orion.
Uh... Wait!
Um, how about a quick bedtime story?
for old times' sake.
Orion, we've talked about this.
Here's a good one. Nice and weighty. Perfect for bedtime.
Um, I'm not sure we have the time for David Foster Wallace tonight.
Okay.
You know, we'll always be here for you, Orion.
But please, stay in bed tonight? Mom and I need our sleep.
Okay, I will. But...
could you at least leave the door open tonight?
All right, bud. Say when.
Okay. A little more open?
Here okay?
Actually, a little more.
- Here? - Good! Yes!
Actually, just a tad bit more?
- Thanks. - Goodnight, sweetie.
- Goodnight, son. - Night, Mom. Night, Dad.
Okay. This isn't so bad.
I take it back!
This is bad! Very, very bad! It's literally the worst!
Because of all the things I'm afraid of,
I'm most afraid of the dark.
Oh, no.
It's an old house. Houses settle.
Nothing to worry about.
My parents have work in the morning. They need their rest.
Can't I just put myself in their shoes for once?
No! No, no, no, no! No!
Curse you, darkness!
What cruel aberrations hide within your inky cloak of... darkness?
Why can't you just leave me alone?
Alone... Alone...
Okay! That's it! I've had it with you!
Every single night with the constant screaming
and the carrying on and whatnot!
Seven nights a week, 365 nights a year.
It's nonstop!
- What are you? - Isn't that obvious?
The room's dark. It's dark out. Hello? I'm Dark. Ta-da!
There it is again.
You know, there are a lot of people that are scared of me.
But you, you're on a whole different level.
Of all the kids who are terrified of the dark,
you are by far the loudest,
the most obnoxious, and frankly, the most hurtful.
And that's no small feat.
You've got some pretty healthy competition.
Check it out.
Millions of people are afraid of the dark.
- You're keeping a list? - Yes, I'm keeping a list.
Do you know how many kids are afraid of me?
It's giving me a complex.
This is just volume one, by the way.
Dark doesn't exist! Dark doesn't exist!
Then why are you having a conversation with me?
You know what I mean. Dark is simply the absence of light.
Not a stupid cartoon character.
Here we go.
Look, you humans have always had weird ways of conceptualizing me.
I'm not listening to you. You know why? Because you're not real!
Oh, I'm very real.
Here, check it out. I even made a little movie about myself.
You know, to offer a different perspective on darkness.
It's kind of a passion project.
Dark has existed for over five hundred million years,
since early life on Earth developed light-sensitive proteins.
So?
You didn't like it.
I'm just trying to offer up some food for thought.
Everyone is against me. It didn't get into Sundance.
And it's so much better than half of the movies there.
It's such a boys' club.
I mean, it's good. It's a little short, though,
for someone who's been around for over five hundred million years.
But, you know, concise is good.
Listen, I didn't ask to be a supernatural entity
that evokes dread and despair.
I'm just a regular guy
trying to do my job.
But people always pick on me.
Truth is, almost everyone is scared of me.
Or hates me.
Or thinks I'm evil.
Some people think I'm nothing. Hurts a guy.
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
No, it's okay.
You know, and I-I like people. That's the thing.
It's just that so much of how you see yourself
is through the eyes of others, you know?
I just wish people would give me a chance.
I know how you feel. A lot of kids at school pick on me, too.
Richie Panici, Davis Jensen, Howard Helstrom,
Isaac Pill, Rebecca Warren.
She moved, but she still sends me threatening letters on my birthday.
Which is sort of nice.
Huh. Yeah. Thoughtful.
I just wanna not be afraid anymore.
Yeah, that'd be nice.
Then maybe I wouldn't have to hear you screaming every night.
Tell you what. I think I've got a way to fix this.
You come watch me do my job for one night,
and you'll finally see that I'm nothing to be afraid of.
You'll learn to appreciate the beauty of the night,
instead of being so terrified all the time.
So what do you say?
- Are you in, or are you in? - I'm...
definitely not in.
Yeah, of course you're not. Well, fine.
If you wanna spend the rest of your life paralyzed by fear,
be my guest, but that's on you.
- Wear pants much? - Hey, Orion, catch!
Cryin' Orion! Cryin' Orion!
Hey, Orion.
I'm super excited for the field trip...
Okay, I'll go!
Mr. Dark?
I knew you'd come around!
Let's shake on it, you know? Make it official.
See? Nothing to it.
Wait, wait, wait.
I know what you're doing, Dad.
What do you mean?
By telling me this story.
- I'm not doing anything. - Yes, you are.
You're telling me a story about how you overcame your fear of the dark
to try and help me overcome my fear of the dark.
- Well, I... - But it's not gonna work.
Fear of the dark is an evolutionary adaptation
that people developed to protect themselves from nocturnal predators.
Wow. You've done your research.
I wrote a poem about it.
"Hypatia the poet." I love that!
It's one poem, Dad.
I think that counts.
It's not very good.
I'm sure it is. Can I hear it?
No!
All I'm saying is that fear of the dark is natural.
It's hardwired in us, so there's nothing we can do about it.
Right. Well, in that case,
- I guess I'll just say goodnight and... - Wait!
I'm not saying it's not a good story, and I don't wanna hear it.
I'm just letting you know that I know what you're doing,
and it's not going to work.
Okay, I got it.
So, you and Dark were flying off into the night...
So, Dark and I were flying off into the night...
Pretty great, right?
If by "pretty" and "great", you mean "terrifying" and "awful", then yes!
I'm gonna get you to overcome your fears if it kills me!
And I'm immortal, by the way, so I've got all the time in the world.
I thought we'd start with a little tour of what I like to call,
"the virtues of night."
See?
Without me, you wouldn't be able to see all the wrinkles on the actors' faces.
So far, you're a terrible salesman.
Hey? Pretty awesome, huh?
I'm allergic to fireflies.
Not allergic to stars, though!
But I am allergic to dying! We're way too high!
You're allergic to living.
- What? - Uh, nothing!
Go ahead. Put your hand in the water.
So a shark can bite it off? Are you insane?
No, so you can see the beauty of the ocean at night.
You are familiar with the concept of "fun", are you not?
"Fun" is just a word people made up to make danger sound more appealing!
Ah! Look at that! You can't have fireworks without the dark!
Technically, you can set them off at any time of day.
Yeah, I guess. It'd be pretty lame, though.
Beauty is in the contrast.
Hey, are you closing your eyes?
I'm protecting my retinas!
- Oh, come on! Open them! - No!
You're missing out on all the fun.
Absolutely not!
- Open your eyes! - No way!
But that defeats the whole purpose!
- Not my purpose! - It's for your own good.
You see how much better that is?
Kid? Kid? Kid!
Gotcha!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - It was an accident.
You dropped me! I could have died! I wanna go home!
Don't worry. I'm going to bring you home.
- Eventually. - Eventually, when?
Hey, look! You can see the Big Dipper.
It's really quite beautiful this time of year.
When are you bringing me home?
Great question. Very probing.
In 24 hours.
- So, anyway, back to the stars... - 24 hours?
Yeah, well, that's how the whole night and day thing works.
It's a 24-hour cycle. I can't go backwards.
- What? Why not? - Look, I better get moving.
But, hey, if you wanna walk home in the middle of nowhere,
- in the dead of night, all by yourself... - Wait, wait, wait!
I can't walk home by myself! It's like 100 miles away!
All right then.
Looks like you've gotta come with me after all.
Buckle up and hold on to your hat because your mind is about to be blown.
Are you covering your eyes again?
- I plead the Fifth. - Really?
Do you have any idea how many people would love to be you right now?
- Zero? - A lot!
The answer is a lot!
Because I'm the coolest Entity of all time!
Because that's what you are when there's no other Entity
that has ever existed that people like better than you.
Good morning, everybody.
Right on time and so, so fine.
It's going to be 75 and sunny.
Low humidity and a cool breeze coming out of the west.
Gonna be fun, fun, fun in the sun, sun, sun.
But, let's be honest, when is it not?
God, I love this job.
Okay, so we got off to a little bit of a shaky start
with the whole "dropping you and almost killing you" thing.
But we can't dwell on that because we've got a lot of work to do, kid.
And in a way, my job is the most fundamental.
I show up every night, and I bring it.
- Bring what? - Dark.
And it's probably the most important job, too,
because without darkness,
the others don't get to do their bits.
What do you mean "the others"?
The other Night Entities.
Wait, there's more?
Raise. In or out, Insomnia?
I'm thinking. I'm always thinking. You know that.
Can't seem to stop my brain. Think, think, think!
Ah, crap. I'm out. What about you, Quiet?
- Call. - Call.
You're up, Sleep.
What?
Royal flush?
Unbelievable.
Gosh darn it!
Huh? What happened? What did I miss?
You won.
Oh, wonderful. Pleasure doing business with you.
Great.
Wait, wait. Why are we going in here?
Well, kid, it's break time!
The other Night Entities and I take one every new time zone.
We're fun, you're gonna love us.
- Heya, gang, what's up! - Heya, Dark!
Welcome back! Huh?
Great work tonight, guys.
- You brought the kid? - Dark brought the kid!
So irresponsible!
Unbelievable!
Are you nuts?
Well, this is the opposite of encouraging.
I've got this.
Orion, allow me to introduce you to the other Night Entities.
There's Sleep, Quiet, Insomnia, Unexplained Noises,
and, of course, the most creative and poetic of us all,
- Sweet Dreams. - Hm.
You brought the Screamer?
The kid who's afraid of everything!
Is this your latest attempt at trying to convince the world that you're not so bad?
- Uh... - Helping random children
to boost your fragile self-esteem
is not in our job description!
Whoa. That is insightfully harsh.
Do you have any idea how many things could go wrong?
I mean, what if he freaks out and slows you down,
and you know who finally catches up, and you get obliterated,
and the concept of darkness ceases to exist,
and the fabric of the universe is permanently and irreparably altered?
- That's a thing that can happen? - Ah, seems unlikely.
All right. Enough of this nonsense.
I'm sorry, honey, but Dark never should've brought you here.
You're just gonna have to find your own way home. Okay?
Now, come on, everyone. Break time's over!
Some of us have work to do.
Wait!
One night could change everything!
I got 24 hours with this kid.
We help him overcome his fear of the dark and all his nightly screaming,
and all that interference with your jobs just goes away.
All right, fine.
Just make sure he stays out of my hair.
Absolutely. Not a problem. Won't be in your hair at all.
- Did you mean that? - What?
You really think you can fix everything I'm afraid of in one night?
One night can change everything.
- Hey, what's that light? - Light? What light? I don't see any light.
The one behind you that you're trying to keep me from seeing.
Me? Keep you from seeing?
That's cuckoo banana talk.
Not so close. I don't think they like me.
What? That's ridiculous. You're totally likeable.
They called me night enemy number one and said I ruin their jobs.
Yeah, admittedly, they didn't make the best first impression.
But just wait until you see them in action.
It's totally inspiring. And not scary at all.
Ah, yes, sleep is responsible for making sure
all the creatures of the world go to sleep at night.
She's down there making everyone go to sleep?
Oh, yeah! You gotta watch, it's really fascinating.
- What? - Oh, don't worry, she's a professional,
and it's a magic pillow.
...and compare them to
our air fried quinoa.
Oh, my God.
Please tell me that's magic chloroform.
Uh, yeah... Magic.
Oh, you're a cutie pie, aren't you?
Stop! No!
Stop!
Dark!
Do you mind? I can't have this blabbermouth freaking out
while I'm trying to get work done!
None of what you're doing is okay!
Smothering someone with a pillow? Chloroform? A hammer?
Not to mention, questions of hygiene with that kiss.
Listen, I've been doing this job for thousands of years.
I think I know what I'm doing, kid.
And these lips are clean!
Clean.
Uh, thanks for letting us see how the sausage gets made!
I don't know if I'll ever be able to sleep again.
Uh, right.
Well, if you're staying up all night then I've got just the Entity for you.
Insomnia is the best impressionist I've ever met.
He makes himself sound like the person he's keeping up,
and then whispers worrisome things in their ears.
Why is that even a job?
Oh, you're just great at making friends, aren't you?
- Not really. - Yeah, that tracks.
Now, watch
and learn.
Classic Insomnia.
Why did I say that to Michelle? She's gonna think I'm an idiot.
Well, I'm pretty sure I'm getting fired.
Huh?
I'm never going to meet my deadline!
She's sleeping pretty soundly.
I'm gonna have to pull out the big guns for this one.
Who can tell me the capital of Delaware?
The capital of Delaware is D.
- Who can tell me the capital of Delaware? - The capital of Delaware is D.
All those sleepless nights were because of him?
What a jerk...
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You think I'm the one doing that to you?
Nuh-uh, pally. I'm just a megaphone for the thoughts people already got.
Don't follow me around with this kid anymore, Dark. Okay?
He's very judgy.
I'm not judgy... Am I?
And we're walking.
Of course, none of us could do our jobs without a little help from Quiet.
Ah! It's too quiet!
- Quiet... Quiet... Quiet... - Enough with that dog!
We told you that this kid would ruin everything, and he is!
- Uh-huh. - I'm not some kinda glorified babysitter.
I need absolute concentration to do my job,
and I can't have this kid getting in the way and screwing everything up!
Now, get him out of here, so I can get back to business...
Okay, got it.
What'd she say?
Was it about me?
I'm gonna be honest.
I never have any idea what she's saying. But she did look pretty angry.
Oh! Unexplained Noises.
Come on, this way.
Hey, hey, what's up?
I'm thinking this moment calls for a crunching sound,
with the tiniest hint of scraping.
What was that? Mommy, Daddy! I'm hearing noises!
Ah, yes. I'm really making an impact.
This is so messed up!
- Hey! It's okay, kid! It's not real... - Can you not...
You're upsetting the delicate balance of nature.
You may not understand it,
but we're doing very important jobs here!
I mean, in the kid's defense,
a lot of your job does involve creeping around and scaring children.
I don't have to explain myself to either of you.
The fact is,
his very presence threatens to destroy
the fabric of the universe as we know it!
Eh, don't let her get to you. Her honk is a lot worse than her bite.
And, hey, I've saved the best for last.
So get ready, and hold on tight!
Ah, there she is.
You mean, all those colors?
Yep. That's Dreams doing her thing.
If seeing her work can't make you appreciate the beauty of nighttime,
- then nothing can. - What do you mean see her work?
Hey! Shh! Keep it down. She's working her magic.
All right, what's churning in your subconscious tonight, Irene?
Mm-hm. Okay. A lot of anxiety about work.
Big presentation tomorrow.
Hmm. Not sure you're ready for this one, Irene.
Really need to impress your boss. Got it.
Oh, and your daughter found a rescue cat that she wants you to adopt.
Mommy, can we keep him?
Good material tonight.
Now, let's work it all out.
You're confidently giving your presentation.
If we just re-use the coil from our winding mechanism,
we can reduce our manufacturing costs by 30%.
Everyone's loving it.
Irene! Irene!
I think you've earned this, Irene.
World's most competent employee?
Mommy!
You're the best mommy ever!
That was one hell of a presentation, Irene.
I definitely think you're getting that promotion.
Oh, Mommy. Can we please keep him?
Yes, of course we can!
We love you, Irene!
Amazing, she's amazing. You're amazed, right?
Yeah. She's pretty great.
I told you.
You know, this reminds me of a dream I had where I was giving a class presentation.
But instead of cheering, everyone was booing me.
And the weirdest part was, my classroom was actually a dentist's office.
- Uh... - Wha... Huh?
What the... I didn't conjure that.
- That's a coincidence, right? - Definitely. It has to be.
Right. Because otherwise, if I said something random,
like, I don't know, "evil cucumber"...
Hey there, Irene. Time for your yearly check-up!
What the heck is going on?
Dark?
No! Off-limits!
You promised to keep him out of my hair!
Look, I need to inspire him,
and your work's the most inspirational stuff
- in the whole night time. - Sorry about the cucumber.
Usually.
Stop! Don't say one more word.
Creating a dream is a very delicate art.
That means anything you say,
or even think, could influence the dream.
- Got it? - Anything I think?
You thought of something scary, didn't you?
What? What did you think of now?
Just a kid from my school.
Who?
Richie Panici.
Run!
You've been "consificated".
The word is "confiscated"!
Cryin' Orion!
Cryin' Orion! Cryin' Orion!
Ever had a swirly before, Orion?
I mean, he can't like get hurt or anything, can he?
No, it's impossible to get hurt in a dream.
- Oh, well, that's a relief. - Unless, of course, he dies.
- Then he dies in real life. - Wait, what?
Kid, you need to get out of here,
or it's going to end very, very badly!
I'm very aware of that!
Come on, Orion! Think of something to get us out of here!
Come on! Think, think, think!
Wait! Page 14 of my sketchbook.
Clogging the toilet and flooding the entire school.
No!
Kid!
Hang on, Orion!
What the heck was that?
Kid, you're either extremely disturbed or extremely creative.
You're extremely lucky.
That could've been a disaster.
But it wasn't a complete disaster. You know why?
Because you looked your fears in the eye and showed them what's what!
Okay, let's try that again.
You know what you do, you just put your hand like this and we...
Is it me, or am I more excited about this than you are?
I didn't overcome anything.
Kid, I was there. I saw it with my own two eyes.
What you saw was me being terrified and trying not to die.
Now that you mention it,
it did kind of have an air of mortal desperation.
But that doesn't make it any less impressive!
Dark, you're not listening.
I didn't overcome my fears. I'm still just as scared as ever.
I know for a fact you're wrong, and I can prove it.
- I sincerely doubt that. - Oh, yeah, Mr. Smarty Pants?
Try this one on for size.
You're not still afraid of me.
Are you?
I'm not scared of you.
See?
That's what I'm talking about.
You know, my daughter's gonna love that we're becoming friends.
I knew you'd start warming up to me.
Hold on, aren't you too young to have a daughter?
My future daughter.
You're wacko, kid.
Wait.
So, are you saying that you could see into the future when you were a kid?
I guess. I don't know. I'm just kind of riffing here.
- Is that a bad idea? - No. I don't know.
The story is great.
I like that you made Light a character, too.
Is he coming back, or was that just like a guest appearance?
Uh, possibly. Like I said, I'm just riffing.
I don't know how you keep making all this stuff up.
Well, you could definitely make up a story like this.
No, I couldn't. It's just... Is it too much stuff?
Like you're already traveling around the world with magical Night Entities,
and now you can predict the future, too?
Gilding the lily?
I don't know what that means.
- It means what you said. - Oh. Then, yeah.
Hm. That's a terrific point.
I'm going to remove the "predicting the future" element.
No more predictions from me as young Orion.
You sure? I mean, it's kind of cool and funny, so...
Nope! It's gone.
Okay.
Hm. I'm lost. Where were we?
You were flying through the night with Dark again.
Right. So Dark and I were flying through the night again,
only this time, it was different.
You're right, you really can see
every wrinkle on the actors' faces!
Like rings on a log.
I mean, I guess it kind of looks like a belt.
Know what it looks like to me?
A robot waiting for a hug.
Whoa.
Is that a gas smell?
Did I remember to turn the oven off?
Nothing is working!
Okay, let's see. Which tape to use? Which tape here...
- Hello! - What did I tell you, kid?
What if life is a cosmic accident...
- What! No, no, no. - ...and my existence has no meaning?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no! - Mommy!
That's it.
- I gotta get back into therapy. - Wow, kid! You go deep.
What was that?
Honey, I think I heard something.
Do you know how much I pay for you by the hour? Wait for once, okay?
Mommy! Mommy!
Oh, sweetie, what's wrong?
I got scared.
I hate the dark so much.
Come on, everyone.
I hear the tea is exceptional here.
Hey, Dark. Thanks by the way.
For what?
You know, all of this.
Showing me that there's more to night than just the darkness.
Ah, don't mention it.
That kid back there?
Don't listen to him.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.
- Maybe he does. - He doesn't.
I was the same way, remember?
He's just afraid.
Yeah. I know what it's like to be afraid, too.
You? What could you possibly be afraid of?
I guess I'm afraid that everyone's right about me.
That I'm not a good guy, and I'm just as scary as everyone says.
Hey, Dark? Remember when you told me you're actually a really great guy?
And I didn't believe you?
Yeah.
I'm starting to believe you.
Aw, thanks.
You know, you really have come a long way.
Uh, I don't know about that.
That's it. Let's get back to work.
- Time to go. - Okay. Time to get sleepy.
Welp, come on. That's our cue. Break's over.
Orion, you dropped this.
Oh, uh, thanks, Quiet.
Eh... don't mention it.
All right, kid, you ready? Hop on. Huh?
You gotta be kidding me.
- Who is he? - That is Light. He's Dark's nemesis.
I like him, for some reason. He makes me feel safe.
Like I'm wrapped in a warm blanket.
You know, if you're into that kind of thing.
"Ooh, look at me. I'm so bright!"
I've got tricks too, you know.
But unlike some of us, I like to leave a little to the imagination,
instead of rubbing it in everyone's face.
Come on, Dark.
Do we really have to go through this every time?
Go through what? I don't know what you're talking about.
Uh, your attitude, your lateness, your insecurity.
How you doing, kid?
Um, hi!
It's always the same routine with you, man.
I show up, you feel inadequate,
then you start to project your insecurities onto me.
Every day, I bring brightness and hope to the world,
and you bring the exact opposite.
Eh... That's not... I'm...
I do more than that.
Wait, really? Like what?
Like, a lot of stuff. I would love to tell you all about it,
but I don't really have the time right now.
Finally, something we can both agree on.
Welp, I'm bringing daylight through here in about three seconds,
so if you want to continue to exist, I'd, uh, you know...
Oh, whatever. We were leaving anyway. Jerk!
I wouldn't call him a jerk. He seems okay.
He's not so great. Trust me.
Hey, Dad?
What, you ready for bed?
Actually, no.
I was wondering if we could go for a little walk while you finish the story.
Oh, really?
So, like, we could be in the night, like Orion and Dark.
Um... Yeah, sure.
I guess it's not a school night.
So, yeah, let's go.
Um, come on. We can cut through the park.
Okay.
You know what?
- I think I like the other way better. - Agreed.
Can I have my hand for a minute?
- Oh, of course. Sorry. - No, it's okay.
I just thought of a couple new lines and didn't want to lose them.
Oh, good ones?
Well, you know, just about how weird it is that you can't see any stars.
Yeah. I couldn't agree more.
You don't have to pretend, you know?
That you wanted to come this way, too.
I'm not pretending.
The street lights were out in the park. It was scary for me, too.
But I thought you got over that.
That's what you said in the story, at least.
Well, it's a complicated story.
Then couldn't you let it be complicated?
Parents love simple stories like that
because whatever problem the character has,
it all gets fixed, and then they don't have to worry about it anymore.
Orion meets Dark. Dark's not so bad.
Orion isn't afraid of him anymore, then there's a dance party.
You think I should add a dance party?
I think if you're still scared, you should let Orion still be scared.
The only stories that really help are the true ones.
That is a really great point.
You think so?
I do. And we should definitely use that idea.
What's wrong?
Yeah, did you die?
- Insomnia! - What?
Jumping to worst case scenarios is my actual job.
No. I'm good.
- Yeah. He's over that now, right? - Totally.
Phew.
Good. All right now, let's get to work.
Race you inside.
Come on.
Uh, you all go ahead. I'm more mortal than you are.
And, I mean, there's not even a night light.
Trip hazard. No thank you.
What are you so scared of?
Nothing. I just... I really like the daytime.
Like, the noises. I mean, have you heard day noises?
- Birds, children playing, brunch? - It sounds amazing.
It is, and you are definitely missing out. Like, in the daytime,
there's this sense of connection between the sounds and colors.
Everything is lit up in the daytime. It's almost psychedelic.
Reds, greens, yellows, violet.
We have colors at night.
I mean, you can see them better if there's a fire.
Yeah, that's light!
- Oh, wow! Really? - Incredible.
- This makes me feel so safe and warm. - I can see why this makes you less afraid.
I'm not saying I need it.
I'm just saying there's no way to imagine how beautiful it is,
if you haven't experienced it.
Huh?
So you're saying the problem is Dark?
Well, in a way, yeah!
And I love him, but I guess he's the issue here, right?
Don't get me wrong, Dark's a really nice guy.
The best. But as long as you're with him,
you can never really enjoy all the amazing things Light has to...
What?
Well... time to go.
Sure you don't want to wait for your new best friend?
Hey, Dark, you know, I think you're the best.
See, I didn't get that from the conversation
- back at the house with the door. - No, no, I was just chatting.
Just because I'm talking about how much I love ice cream,
doesn't mean I don't love French fries.
- Which one am I? - What?
Ice cream or French fries?
Um, French fries?
And Light is ice cream?
- Exactly! - Which one do you love more?
Is that really important?
Exactly!
I'm just saying, I wish you could all experience daylight. You, too!
That's saying you wish everyone could
experience me not being around.
That's not what I meant to say. Perfect!
Then you won't mind unsaying it to the rest of the team,
in a touching, heartfelt speech.
Hello!
Come on.
It has been brought to my attention
that some of my comments during our last break
have been interpreted in a way I never intended.
So let me be clear.
I love the nighttime and my good friend, Dark.
Now, some of you might feel
you are missing out on other experiences in the world.
But I'd like to take a moment to remind you of the old adage,
"The grass is always greener on the other side of the..."
World! Because it's daytime there, and you can see that it's green!
Wait. Wait. That's not what I was trying to say.
But it's true! I mean, what does green grass even look like?
Yeah! Why should the Day Entities get all the colors?
- Yeah! - Exactly! See?
- That's what I think, too. - Okay, everyone.
I think we're getting a little off-track here.
Dark is great. He has so many wonderful characteristics.
Like what?
Look... my point is that I was wrong.
Implying that Day is superior to Night was wrong. Period.
Sure, some people might say
that you're not as pretty and vibrant as Day, but so what?
Because, ultimately, the thing that makes the vibrancy of Day exist
is its exact opposite, dark and empty.
So, you see, if you think about it that way,
you are the wind beneath Day's wings.
I don't think this is helping.
Wait, let me finish. So, in conclusion, thank you.
Thank you for performing these humble, thankless tasks,
in order to make Light-filled Day great again.
- Well, that's it. I'm leaving. - What? You're leaving?
Actually, I'm staying.
I'm staying and waiting for daylight. Maybe I'll be able to get a job there.
Oh, come on. Be reasonable.
You! Don't even talk to me, you.
You're the reason everyone hates us. It's you and your infernal Dark.
- But I'm your friend. - Some friend!
Keeping me from the true beauty of life.
Come on, Unexplained Noises, we all know you're not actually going to quit.
My name is Debby now. Call me Debby.
Debby!
Well, that's just great.
But at least we've got the rest of you. Right?
Come on, guys, let's hit the road.
I think what Debby means is that we could all use a little light in our lives.
We all need to feel seen and...
Well, since no one else will, I'm just going to come out and say it.
We all need to feel seen and heard.
- Yeah! That's what I've been saying. - Yeah, we do!
- Exactly! - That's it. I quit!
I'm quitting, too. I'm sick of living in your shadow.
Wait, what?
Daydreams are a thing, right? I bet that'll be a fun new challenge.
Definitely better than nightmares.
Dreams, please...
Well, that does it. If Dreams is quitting then so am I.
I'm not sticking around in the nighttime for dreamless sleep.
What's the point?
Well, if Sleep leaves, then, what...
it's my job to keep everyone awake all the time?
No, no. That's too much work.
I quit, too.
Okay, break time's over, guys.
Stop messing around. We need to keep moving.
Can't wait to see the dawn of a new day.
Guys, don't make me do this by myself, please.
We all need to work together.
We're...
we're friends.
Well, I really enjoyed spending all that time with you all.
Have a good morning.
Good morning, everybody!
Did someone say, "Light"?
Honestly, I don't know what anyone sees in him.
That makes one of us.
There's nothing left of the night but me.
This isn't night anymore.
It looks like nothing now.
It sounds like nothing.
And tomorrow, even you're gone.
So I just fly around by myself forever?
- This was a terrible idea. - I'm really sorry.
Maybe tomorrow, I can find them during the day,
- and I can try to convince them that... - No!
I'm not going on.
I'm going to sit on this... whatever it is.
Rock? I don't know. I don't think it's alive.
I'm gonna sit right here on this thing and wait for daylight.
- No, you can't! - Why not?
Nobody likes me anyway.
- That's not true. - So where did everyone go?
Hey, Dark!
Let's go! Move it or lose it.
Uh, Dark?
Come on! Let's go.
Dark, come on, you can't be in the light.
You can't be where you're not. You'll disappear.
I'm willing to risk that possibility.
Okay.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
- Wait, don't! - I'm really sorry, kid.
But day waits for no one.
Dark, you have to leave now!
Oh, I didn't get that right at all.
What are the odds?
No! Dark!
Dark!
Bummer. I-I tried to warn him.
Well, I have to go make life on Earth possible and stuff, so...
see you, kid.
Good morning, everyone!
I hope your days are as bright and beautiful as your faces.
Yeah, but then what?
- I don't know. - What do you mean?
I don't know what's next. That's all I got.
You're just leaving little you all by himself in the middle of...
Where are you?
Europe somewhere? I-I don't know.
That's not a good ending.
Yeah. I've said it was a complicated story.
I guess I just ran out of ideas.
It's your story. It happened to you!
True. But I don't know how it ends.
These visible patterns amongst the stars
came to be known as constellations.
Looking over various ancient depictions
of the night sky,
- we start to recognize... - We're looking at a ceiling.
It's a really good illusion, though. And highly educational.
We should be able to look at the real sky at night.
They build a city that blocks out the stars,
then they put up fake stars to look at?
That's... That's a really profound thought, sweetie.
Thanks. I didn't mean to put down your job.
I really think the planetarium is cool. Really cool.
It's a cool place to work.
Thanks. I like it, and I like what you said. Both things.
Maybe I have an idea about where the story could go.
Oh, yeah? Well, let's hear it.
Really? Are you sure?
I'm very sure. Go on.
Okay. So, I show up.
- You? - Do you not like it?
No, I love it. Keep going.
I always wondered if we would be friends if we were the same age.
I can't wait to find out. Please, continue.
Okay. So, I show up.
Hello.
Uh, hello, person appearing on my turtle.
I'm Hypatia.
The ancient Greek astronomer?
Well, I'm not her. Named after her, though.
I guess that makes more sense. I'm Orion.
The constellation.
Yes, which, to me, looks less like a hunter and more like a...
like a robot waiting for a hug.
Yeah. I've heard that.
Do you know where we are?
Europe somewhere? I don't know.
Oh, man. I'm so far from home.
I ruined a lot of things last night.
I know. I've been following your story.
- Really? - Yeah.
Without night, people won't be able to sleep.
And without sleep, everyone's gonna go crazy.
- We can't let this happen! - That's why I'm here.
I think I have an idea about how to get all the Night Entities back.
Really? What's your idea?
I have a poem I wrote to try to help.
"Now that it's gone, I miss the night
Now that the only thing left is light"
I don't know. I don't think this will help.
Keep going.
"And something else Neither night nor day
Maybe everyone cheers, 'Hooray'
But I miss the night Because it's like me
And when it is dark is when I best see
Maybe the world has become too bright"
"Too loud, too selfish, and ready to fight"
Possible apocalyptic event,
which is creating a climate emergency,
with catastrophic consequences in the absence of darkness.
Huh. It's not quite how I imagined it.
"And the one That is quiet never gets heard
And the ones that are awkward Dismissed as mere nerds"
Huh.
Okay.
I gotta admit, this is starting to undermine my confidence a little.
"I once thought quiet The absence of sound
But learned it's the space Where small sounds can be found
I once thought Dark Was the absence of Light
But it is the place Where starlight is bright
The Quiet, the Dark The Dreams once embraced me
They let me feel safe In a world that erased me
Now that it's gone, I miss the night
Now that the only thing left is light"
You're a poet.
Yeah, I am.
It was beautiful. Thank you.
We need to bring the night back to the world.
But Dark is... He's gone. We can't make night without him.
But he's not.
Dark is still very much alive,
in your memory.
But the only one who can access your memories is...
Dreams. We need your help, Dreams.
We need all of you.
The whole team.
Remember, if you die in the dream, you die in real life.
- Insomnia! - What? I'm doing my job!
On second thought, maybe it's not such a good idea to put the fate of the world
in the hands of an 11-year-old kid
with severe performance anxiety.
Don't worry.
I'll be right there with you.
I'm on it.
Okay, Sleep. You're up.
Do not worry. I've got this.
All right. Time to put you to...
sheep!
Great job, Sleep.
You ready?
Sweet dreams, Orion.
We're gonna have to go deep. Into the darkest recesses of his mind.
Talking to Sally.
Speaking in class.
Murder clowns.
Cell phone waves... Mosquito bites...
Falling off a skyscraper.
Oh, yes. Here it is.
It's the night you first met Dark.
You're in your bedroom...
you hear a low rumbling from the room's darkest corner.
You see an ominous form taking shape...
as if being drawn out of
the very darkness of the room.
- Dark! - Orion!
- You came back for me. - Of course I did. You're my friend.
I was afraid I lost you.
Nope. I'm right here, bud.
Huh?
- Whoa! - Dark!
Oh, no!
Dark!
Orion!
What is that?
Why does it keep showing up?
This is in your head, Orion! You're the only one who can stop it!
You have to go in there and pull him out!
I can't just jump in there! What's gonna happen?
I have no idea, but I think that's the point!
Wh... What are you talking about?
We always want to know the ending
because it makes things less scary in the middle parts.
But maybe being scared is just a part of life.
I think you just need to feel the fear.
And do it anyway.
Good luck, Orion.
Thank you, Hypatia.
Hang on, Dark. I'm coming!
Orion! Over here!
Orion!
Dark!
Now let's get you out of here.
It's not gonna hold!
Oh, no. Just hang on.
We need to wake him up now!
If we don't do something, they're both going to...
Get torn into a million tiny pieces and die?
Move over. I've got this.
It's going to suck us in!
What happens now?
I don't know. But being with you, somehow,
it makes the horror of the unknown less horrible.
I know what you mean.
- It's been a pleasure knowing you, Orion. - The pleasure is all mine.
Orion!
Time to wake up! You're late for school!
You read an article about how sleep stunts your growth!
Come on, wake up!
- Why isn't it working? - I don't know, man!
I've never put that many Z's on anyone before!
Wake up, wake up! Time to wake up!
Wake up!
- Wake up already! - Come on, wake up!
Orion, if you don't wake up you're going to miss your field trip.
You're going to miss your field trip.
Sally!
Dark. We made it.
That's some nice work, kid.
All right! There it is. Glad to have you back, old buddy.
Bye, Orion. It's been a dream spending the night with you.
- It really has. - See you, Hypatia.
I admire your work.
And I admire yours.
And I admire yours, too.
Oh... Wow.
You're the best, Dark.
Yeah, I second that.
- Thanks for everything, Dark. - Hear, hear.
- So, this is it. - But I'll see you tomorrow night.
Ah, sure. You'll see dark. I mean, I won't look exactly like this.
But you'll see me in new ways.
Ways that are even better.
Yeah. I can see that now,
and I can appreciate it.
Thanks for that.
No. Thank you, Orion.
- For what? - Well, seeing me the way you do.
So much of how you see yourself is through the eyes of others. You know?
So, you gonna go on that field trip tomorrow?
Yep.
- You nervous? - Terrified.
But I'm going anyway.
Ah, good for you, kid. You're gonna be all right.
Well, it was nice meeting you, Hypatia.
It was nice meeting you, too, Dark.
- You've got a good father there. - I know.
Wait, what?
- I don't understand. - I came to help you get home.
- From the future? - Um, I guess so, yeah.
- Am I okay, in the future? - Yeah, you're doing good.
So, I don't have to worry so much, is what you're saying?
I guess that's what I'm saying.
They look so young.
Really? They look a million years old to me.
What?
Orion. I thought we agreed, no check-ins tonight.
We did, Dad. It's tomorrow night. You and Mom slept through the entire day.
- What? Oh, my God, it's true. - Really? Holy cow, we overslept!
Yeah, I think you were tired.
I-I wanted to let you sleep. To give you a break.
Who's that?
Believe it or not, that's my child...
hood friend.
- Oh! Nice to meet you. - Hi.
- What's your name? - Hypatia.
That's pretty.
So, I was wondering if you could maybe drive Hypatia home.
- Um, where do you live, sweetheart? - Manhattan.
Manhattan? How'd you get here? Do your parents know you're here?
- Uh, sort of. - And they can't pick you up?
Maybe we'll give them a call.
- What do we do? - I don't know.
We can't just drop you off in New York 20 years before you were born.
Yes, I know.
How did you get back here in the first place?
- I don't know. I just did it. - Well, do it again.
Okay.
- What's wrong? - I don't know. It's not working.
This is terrible. Maybe my parents can adopt you.
- What? No! What about Mom? - She seemed to like you in there.
Not your mom. My mom. Your wife?
Oh, yeah.
I have a wife?
- Yes, my mother! - I know!
This is a disaster!
Huh?
Who are you?
I'm Tycho. I came to help.
I have my time machine out on your lawn.
I can take you home.
- You can? - But we have to go now.
Coming back to get you has released interdimensional time monsters,
and we have to stop them before they multiply and destroy history!
See you in 20 years.
See you in 20 years.
When I say "now," make a beeline for the capsule.
Got it!
Now!
Oh, yeah!
Hold on to your butts!
What the...
Dad!
Hypatia!
Hi, Tycho. Long time no see. You haven't changed a bit.
You have. You're so old now.
Well, I guess I have grown up a little bit.
Well, gotta go.
Thank you for getting me home.
No problem.
And then I piloted the time machine module all the way back here,
killed the time monsters, and climbed back in bed.
- Huh. That's such a good ending. - Yeah?
Definitely. Thank you for figuring it out. I was stuck.
- You sleepy? - Yeah.
- Goodnight, sweetie. - Goodnight, Mom.
Open or closed?
Mm. Closed tonight.
Okay. Sleep tight.
Hey, Dad.
He asleep?
- Almost. - Did he come up with an ending?
He did.
Time machine.
Oh, that's good. A time machine.
That's a good idea.
I thought so, too. You up for a while?
I'm heading back to the city in the morning,
so I thought I would just enjoy the night for a bit.
Okay, Dad. I'm turning in.
Goodnight, Hypatia.
Goodnight, Mom.
Goodnight, Hypatia.
Mind if I sit with you?
I would love that.
In the lives of every creature on Earth...
...are echoes...
...of events that occurred a long, long time ago.
Events of unimaginable scale...
and violent beauty...
that connect all living things...
...their every action and decision,
their every heartbeat,
to the grandest story ever told.
This is a tale 13.8 billion years in the making...
that has seen billions of stars
and billions of worlds...
live and die...
to create the only planet we know of
that is home to life.
From the stardust that built us...
to the cosmic ingredients that sustain us...
and the starlight that powers it all,
this is the story of our universe.
East Africa.
It's where life's most vital connection to the universe can be found.
And a very special predator...
named Wa Chini.
Life for a cheetah is a never-ending search for food...
for vital energy.
And this is one of the hardest places on Earth for a predator to obtain it.
The blistering sun has driven away nearly everything
from these dry, desolate plains.
Any creature that remains here struggles to survive.
Wa Chini's sole focus...
...the only thing driving her...
...is hunger.
This simple, primal impulse
stems from a deep connection she has to her surroundings
that extends beyond the Serengeti,
beyond our planet
to the universe itself.
Every cell in Wa Chini's body...
is linked to an ancient stream of energy...
...connecting her life to the heart of a star.
This unbroken stream spans vast reaches of space...
and stretches back 13.8 billion years.
Ancient energy that existed at the origin of our universe
powers everything.
Every planet.
Every star.
Every life.
Wa Chini is hunting for energy...
but not just for herself.
A mother of two five-month-old cubs,
she's desperate to feed her hungry family.
It's dry season, and food is scarce.
And yet, energy is more abundant than ever.
It's just hiding in plain sight.
The largest, brightest, hottest object in our solar system...
the sun.
Huge loops of searingly hot plasma erupt from its surface.
Our sun blasts out the energy of four and a half trillion atomic bombs every second...
sending more power to our planet in an hour
than the entire world consumes in a year.
But as impressive as this gigantic fireball is...
Wa Chini cannot eat sunlight.
She only eats things that run...
like gazelle.
Her spotted coat provides camouflage, essential for stalking prey.
With few places to hide, getting closer isn't an option.
Luckily, Wa Chini has a trick up her sleeve.
Cheetah are the fastest animals on land.
From zero to a hundred in just three seconds...
but gazelles are a pretty close second.
Wa Chini uses up a lot of energy...
but gains nothing.
An adult cheetah can survive for over a week without a meal.
But cubs, they can go no longer than a few days.
And these two are getting very, very hungry.
Hunting at such great speeds is incredibly depleting.
Wa Chini's energy reserves are now dangerously low.
It will be hours before she has the strength to hunt again.
Wa Chini and her cubs are running on empty.
Animals all over the planet fight the same ongoing battle
between consuming...
and using energy.
No matter your strategy, be it fast or slow,
your next meal is never guaranteed.
Hunger is something all of us must overcome.
Having recovered from her last chase,
Wa Chini is looking for her next opportunity.
Like all cheetah mothers,
she's parenting solo.
To keep her young cubs well-fed,
she should make a kill every day.
But it's taken her so long to recover
that the sun is now setting.
As the light fades,
so does this family's hopes of a meal.
As Earth rotates...
the Serengeti turns away from the sun and into darkness.
It's a powerful reminder of life's connection to the sun.
Our story is the sun's story.
Long, long ago...
...our solar system was even colder and darker than it is today.
And yet, these were the perfect conditions for the birth of a star.
At temperatures close to absolute zero,
the force of gravity began pulling dust and gas together...
...into a massive cloud.
The cloud collapsed inwards,
crushing itself into a glowing hot ball of gas.
A protostar.
Like Wa Chini, this star in the making had a ferocious hunger...
pulling in so much gas that jets of hot matter
were propelled from its poles,
stretching out light years into space.
The infant star continued to grow for 30 million years...
...until finally,
it became hot enough to generate power all on its own.
Our sun.
Its golden rays have now shone brilliantly and steadily...
for 4.6 billion years.
It's just one star in a galaxy of billions.
And yet, it is a most special one...
because it is the one that delivers heat and light...
to this incredible, vibrant planet.
Every living thing in the Serengeti depends on the sun for its energy.
Wa Chini's cubs are drained, beyond hungry now.
They need to eat today.
But all Wa Chini can provide this morning is precious TLC.
In this parched land,
our sun both gives and takes.
Its fierce energy is what life needs.
But it also has the power to destroy.
It was never going to be easy living this close to a giant nuclear reactor.
To understand the source of this unbearable heat,
we must peer into the inferno...
...beneath the outer layers of bubbling hot plasma...
650 thousand kilometers down...
to the core of our sun.
Our star's heart would seem surprisingly calm...
but on an atomic level, it's pure chaos.
This is the hottest part of our solar system.
Temperatures here reach 15 million degrees Celsius...
creating the conditions for an event that can happen almost nowhere else.
Atoms collide at high speed and fuse...
...releasing pure energy.
This process is called nuclear fusion
and is what makes our sun shine.
In fact, it's what powers all the stars in our universe.
This energy released by stars can be traced back to the beginning of time...
when there was no matter,
and all that existed in the entire universe was energy.
And every bit of it lives on in our universe today.
As sunlight hits the Serengeti,
energy that's been flowing for 13.8 billion years
finds its way to Wa Chini and her cubs
and continues its journey through their environment.
It is never created or destroyed.
It is simply transformed endlessly.
But Wa Chini and her Cubs can only access this energy in one form...
meat.
And there are rival predators out here...
who could snatch not just her food but her cubs as well.
If they don't feed soon,
they will die regardless.
It's a meager snack, but after two days without food,
it's a lifesaver.
But more than 10% of cheetah kills are stolen.
Wa Chini must defend every scrap of energy she captures...
...because when energy is scarce,
competition is fierce.
Wa Chini's struggle to survive and sustain her family is repeated
day after day...
...month after month.
Every meal is a fight.
In the battle between using and acquiring energy...
Wa Chini is only just breaking even.
Dry season on the Serengeti is defined by constant hunger.
But change is in the air.
The sun's heat has pulled what moisture there is high into the sky.
And what goes up
must eventually come down.
Rains sweep across the plains
and bring dry season to an end.
As the clouds clear,
a glimmer of hope appears.
A single blade of grass cannot feed Wa Chini's family...
but deep within its cells
lies the answer to their hunger.
Here, there's a hidden world.
Microscopic stacks called grana bask in the warm rays from the sun.
Their surface is covered with a forest of tiny, light-harvesting proteins
that capture energy from our nearest star.
They're packed with the green pigment chlorophyll,
which absorbs rays of light.
Through the magic of photosynthesis...
water combines with carbon dioxide...
and sunbeams are spun into sugar.
In a matter of days, the once parched plains are painted green.
Billions of blades of grass now soak up the boundless sunlight.
And the universe's energy becomes embedded in the landscape.
There's only one problem.
Cheetahs can't eat grass.
But far away in the northern woodlands,
there are beasts... that do.
Hundreds of thousands of them.
Wildebeest.
They have wide mouths, flexible lips, and four stomachs
that are perfectly adapted to eating grass.
The massive herds are constantly on the move
in search of fresh grazing.
To find the grass, they follow the rain.
Driven, like all of us...
by hunger.
But if there is one rule in the Serengeti,
it's that food never comes easy.
The Mara River...
home to some of the largest crocodiles on Earth.
It's a serious roadblock
in the wildebeests' quest for vital energy.
To the south, Wa Chini spends every available moment
scouring the plains for something edible.
After six months surviving on a meager diet,
one of her cubs has managed to grow bigger...
...and is even learning some hunting skills of her own.
But the other cub is nowhere to be seen.
Just five percent of cheetah cubs make it into adulthood.
Most lose their lives to hungry lions and hyenas.
This cub's future is far from guaranteed...
even when energy is tantalizingly close.
Amassed on the banks of the Mara,
the wildebeest have nowhere to go but forward.
But someone needs to be first.
One and a half million wildebeest
make this journey each year.
And here, the battle between using and consuming energy...
plays out on an epic scale.
For those lucky enough to make it across,
this is only the beginning.
Now, they must travel hundreds of kilometers
day and night
for over two months...
to get to the grassy plains.
Wa Chini eagerly awaits the arrival of the wildebeest,
but there is another migration taking place that is critical
to the survival of both animals.
It's the journey of unfathomable distance and time.
And without it, every creature on the Serengeti would go hungry.
In the core of our sun,
as atoms collide and fuse,
photons are released and stream outwards.
These tiny packages of light energy have zero mass
and travel at the speed of light.
But inside the unbelievably dense core,
they're restrained, absorbed, scattered.
A trip that would normally take just two seconds can take a million years.
It's a mind-boggling torturous struggle to escape the sun.
But slowly, the photons do rise
upward through the sun's layers
toward its raging hot surface...
where they can finally be set free.
They radiate out in all directions...
as starlight...
traveling 150 million kilometers in just over eight minutes.
Arriving just in time...
to meet the wildebeest at the end of their journey.
Each individual blade of grass absorbs ten quadrillion photons every second...
capturing enough energy overall to feed these massive herds.
From star...
...to grass...
to wildebeest...
sunlight now provides them with power to move...
to grow...
to reproduce.
And the longer they're out on the plains eating,
the longer they're available to be eaten.
Rich, delicious, plentiful energy
is finally within striking distance.
But with three million eyes watching...
Wa Chini needs to move fast.
Luckily, she's a cheetah.
At last, Wa Chini gets a taste of starlight.
With every bite,
proteins and fats imbued with cosmic energy
enter Wa Chini's bloodstream.
Their final destination are her body's cellular power plants,
mitochondria...
where one last transformation will take place.
Within each mitochondrion is a surging landscape.
Canyons of membranes rippling with complex chemistry.
It's here that the energy-rich food reacts with oxygen
and is finally broken down...
releasing our universe's energy directly into Wa Chini's cells...
...powering every action and thought,
every little movement.
The journey from star to cell is complete.
Energy that once lit up the universe
now gives Wa Chini and her cub the gift of life.
In green season,
hunger is just a memory.
Across the Serengeti, energy is continually transformed...
passing from one life to another,
nourishing the entire ecosystem.
Our sun is the ultimate provider.
Everything feeds on starlight.
The trouble is, there's nothing to feed the sun.
And in five billion years,
it will run out of fuel.
As its core collapses,
the sun will expand...
and become a red giant...
that will devour the inner planets, Mercury and Venus.
As it balloons out toward Earth,
the extreme gravity will rip our moon to shreds...
...leaving a ring of moon rock around Earth.
The ultimate fate of our planet is unknown.
But there will be one last sunrise...
before our star's outer layers blow away,
and it takes its final breath.
All that will remain is a dying ember,
a white dwarf,
barely the size of our Earth, surrounded by a vast glowing cloud.
A beacon to the universe.
We were here.
But right now,
our star continues to shine down on us...
...and will for billions of years to come,
its energy a vital force for all life.
Next in the story of our universe,
whether you are a blazing star...
a vast black hole,
or a chimpanzee learning the ropes,
everything needs time.
But what do you really know about this mysterious dimension?
Why does everything have a past, present, and future?
And would any of us be here...
without time?
It's morning in the forest.
And for this troop of chimpanzees,
it's time to get out of bed
and get on with the day.
But when you sleep in a nest 40 meters up in the air,
it can be a bit of a challenge.
This morning ritual has been playing out like clockwork
for countless generations.
A rhythm driven by one of the most mysterious properties of our universe.
Time.
And time is playing an extra important role
for one female chimp.
Celeste is in her mid-30s, and she has a ticking clock inside her.
A clock that was set 13.8 billion years ago.
From The Big Bang came atoms...
...and energy...
...which have journeyed across vast reaches of space.
And these ingredients
are now assembling...
to create a new life.
In Celeste's womb, a tiny chimpanzee is forming.
It will be another 150 days before this baby meets the world.
That's the time it takes.
And without time,
nothing in our universe would ever be born.
From the youngest chimpanzee...
to the oldest black hole.
But how did time start in the first place?
Does everything experience time in the same way?
And will our universe's clock ever stop ticking?
The day begins for a chimp much as it does for us.
Breakfast.
A critical meal... when you're eating for two.
Celeste is already an experienced mom.
Her firstborn,Â Apollo, is the dominant male of the troop.
And he can be a bit slow to get going in the morning.
Each chimp is a different age.
Each has a distinct personality.
But all of them are creatures of routine.
Their lives governed by the passage of time.
We can't see it.
Or hear it.
We can't influence it in any way.
And yet, every heartbeat, every choice and action,
every inaction is a consequence of time's continuous flow.
It can whiz by or drag on.
But time ticks ever onward.
Stars and planets form, age, and die.
In their wake, new stars emerge.
And from a rare few,
the most mysterious objects in the universe are born.
Black holes.
Time is the cosmic conductor.
Nothing can escape its grasp.
Although we have devices that can track and measure time...
...chimps don't.
Celeste and her family use the sun as their guide.
Rising and arcing across the sky.
As it moves...
so do they.
Chimps rarely sleep in the same nest twice.
Each morning, they head off in search of fresh fruit.
Journeying from one part of their territory to another.
But right now, the ripest fruit...
is on the other side of an open plain.
Apollo and the strongest members of the troop go ahead
to make sure it's safe for the others.
Out in the open,
they're vulnerable to predators, rival chimps,
and the heat of the rising sun.
They need to be quick.
Time is ticking.
The sun traveling across the sky
forms the chimps' basic unit of time.
From sunrise to sunset and back to sunrise.
The 24-hour day.
But a day is not actually a measure of time at all.
It's a measure of motion.
As our planet rotates on its axis,
the forest moves through space at 1,600 kilometers per hour.
It takes 24 hours for Earth to do one full turn.
Giving the chimps 24 hours of movement,
12 in sunshine and 12 in darkness.
Again and again.
It's our planet's steady spin that sets Earth's master clock.
And is the chimps' trusted timekeeper.
But this essential cycle we take for granted...
is not universal.
As soon as you leave our home planet...
...the 24-hour day no longer applies.
Flying closest to the sun...
...is the planet Mercury.
Compared to us, it rotates at a snail's pace.
Our neighbor Venus spins even slower.
It takes longer to rotate on its axis
than it does to orbit the sun.
Making Venus's day longer than its year.
Each planet has its own unique day length.
Including planets far beyond our solar system.
Sixty-three light years away,
orbiting a young star,
is Beta Pictoris b.
It spins so fast...
...it bulges out at the sides.
It is the fastest-spinning world we know of.
Here, a day lasts just eight hours.
Every planet in our universe spins at its own speed.
Billions of worlds,
each with their own clock,
ticking away to different rhythms.
But all moving forward on a universal cosmic timeline.
Back on Earth,
with the sun now almost directly overhead,
the chimps know exactly what time it is.
It's lunchtime.
And their crossing of the savanna has been timed to perfection.
They've hit the jackpot.
These sweet berries of the African grape tree
are only around for a few weeks.
A rare seasonal gift from the forest.
Where the middle of the day is a very productive time.
Animals of all sizes are tending to their daily tasks.
And each experiences time differently.
For small creatures that live fast, short lives...
...lunchtime can feel like a lifetime.
For slower, longer living things,
an hour can go by in the blink of an eye.
But whether you're living in high speed
or in slow motion,
all life in the forest must adhere to the same 24-hour day.
And as the world keeps spinning...
...those days keep ticking by...
dictating the lives of every chimpanzee.
One in particular.
At just 15 weeks,
this baby's entire body could fit in its mother's hand.
For it to fully form,
a cascade of perfectly timed events must occur.
For the next 130 days,
every minute, every nanosecond is critical.
New cells divide and grow with remarkable speed and precision.
Right now,
brain cells are multiplying at a rate of around 15 million per hour.
All of us, from our very first moments,
have a deep biological relationship with time.
As the sunlight wanes,
the chimps instinctively switch gears.
To evening mode.
Nesting calls signal to the whole troop.
It's time to find a safe place to spend the night.
Their bedding needs to be soft but strong.
It doesn't hurt if it tastes good either.
The rhythm of every day in the forest
is determined by the sun's position in the sky.
But the chimp's innate sense of time
comes from something inside them.
Deep in their brains is a biological clock.
Bundles of neurons act as a pendulum...
...controlled by genes that switch on and off...
and a cycle that repeats every 24 hours.
These clock genes create a circadian rhythm in the body
that waxes and wanes in sync with our planet's rotation.
Controlling hormones...
...heart rates,
and energy levels.
And right now, the chimps' body clocks are sending the message,
"It's time to get sleepy."
Not everyone can though.
Celeste's baby's brain is still forming.
With no internal clock of its own,
it relies on its mother's hormones to keep it synchronized.
But baby doesn't always get the memo.
Lucky for Celeste,
with so much growing to do,
her baby does eventually drift off.
While the chimps go to sleep high in the treetops...
other forest dwellers are just waking up.
Body clocks tick away
in the cells of plants and animals throughout the forest.
Clock genes evolved two and a half billion years ago
in the first living cells.
Those that could anticipate the light and dark of a day had an advantage.
And as life evolved,
it synchronized to Earth's motion.
So that today,
these clocks exist in almost every creature on Earth.
Although some creatures prefer day and others night...
all life is dancing to the same beat.
Thanks to cellular clocks
that tick in time with the spin of our Earth.
As yesterday becomes a memory...
...another new day begins in the forest.
A fresh cycle,
and yet, no clock can ever truly be reset.
And there are subtle clues all around the forest that reveal why.
Nothing is the same today as it was yesterday.
Least of all Apollo,
who seems to haveÂ woken up on the wrong side of the bed.
When he's in a bad mood...
the rest of the group just need to keep their heads down.
He soon finds a target for his rage, though.
Some of the younger chimps have found honey for breakfast.
And they forgot to invite Apollo to join them.
You soon learn, never get on the wrong side of the dominant male.
He's got a nasty bite.
Thankfully, it's not too serious.
With a bit of care, this wound should heal.
But wounds leave behind scars,
etched into the chimps' bodies.
Indelible marks of the past that reveal the one universal truth about time.
It has a direction.
You can never go back in time...
...only forward into the future.
This is time's arrow,
and it leaves scars on everything
across Earth...
...and beyond.
Our moon is pockmarked with battle scars that tell stories of ancient events.
So too are the planets.
Their surfaces testament to a lifetime of bombardment by asteroids and comets.
But perhaps the most impressive impact crater in our solar system
belongs to a moon of Saturn.
Mimas.
The Herschel crater is 130 kilometers across.
Whatever created this enormous scar...
must have come close to shattering the moon to pieces.
Mimas lives to tell the tale.
But events like this are irreversible.
And they differentiate the past from the present.
Impact craters are timestamps
that mark a unique moment in history.
We can never revisit the moment they were created.
But we can piece together traces of past events
and map a course back through time.
Before craters.
Before planets.
Before stars.
Back to a time before time.
Our universe had a beginning.
A very big bang...
that created three-dimensional space
and time.
But space and time are not separate.
Time is woven into the fabric of the universe.
Bound to space as our universe's fourth dimension.
The Big Bang set the universe's clock ticking.
Propelling everything into the future.
It created the arrow of time.
From our universe's very first moments...
...it pushes us all into the future,
causing everything to grow,
age...
...and change.
From childhood... ...to adulthood,
we all travel through life in the same direction.
Getting older day by day.
And with age comes wisdom
as youthful innocence is replaced by experience.
Time's arrow leads us through these stages of life.
It shapes us.
Defines who we are.
From our first moments...
to our last.
Chimps rarely live past the age of 40.
Nothing is immortal.
Everything that exists in our universe has a finite lifespan.
Including, perhaps, the universe itself.
Today, the galaxies are filled with stars.
But 95% of stars that will ever exist have already been born.
So, as our universe journeys into the future...
...the stars... ...one by one, will blink out...
...leaving the universe to face an ever-darkening future,
stretching out for trillions,
that's thousands of billions, of years.
The age of starlight
will be followed by a dark age of black holes.
These monsters feed on the remnants of dead stars and planets.
And as they do,
their ever-increasing gravity scars the very fabric of the universe.
Distorting both space and time.
The edge of a black hole, called the event horizon,
is a region where gravity has become so strong
it causes time to slow down practically to a standstill.
But even black holes can't escape time's arrow.
In the far, far future...
...when there are no stars or planets left to consume,
they will begin to starve.
And slowly...
very slowly,
they will shrink.
When they die,
no one truly knows what comes next.
But it could be the end of our universe.
Here on Earth, none of us can slow the passage of time.
And one of Celeste's aunts is reaching the end of her time.
Retreating from the group, she heads into the forest alone.
She has lived many years.
But this day will be her last.
While the world continues to spin,
her body lies still.
But time doesn't just carry us toward endings.
It also creates beginnings.
As days turn into weeks and weeks into months,
there are big changes for one special chimpanzee.
Say hello to Cosmo.
Her brain and limbs are now fully formed.
And her eyes are ready to see the world.
The exact timing of her birth is impossible to know.
But she could be born any day now.
She's been in the womb for eight months.
But her journey began long, long ago.
The elements that made her came from dying stars.
The water that flows through her body came from distant worlds.
The energy that powers her muscles came from the heart of our sun.
But it's that most mysterious ingredient,
the one that started ticking 13.8 billion years ago...
that has led all other ingredients to this moment.
In this place.
On this planet.
Another sunrise, another morning.
And this one is extra special.
Welcome to Earth, Cosmo.
This precious moment will never be repeated for Celeste.
But Cosmo's journey has just begun.
It will take around three months
for her body clock to synchronize to the rhythm of the planet,
one year before she can truly communicate,
and perhaps 15 years until she is fully grown.
So much lies ahead.
Like Cosmo,
our universe is still in its infancy
at the beginning of an unimaginably long lifespan.
We are living in the age of starlight.
A moment when time's arrow has filled the universe with beauty...
...and wonder.
But it's a brief window of time
that will never be repeated in the history of our universe.
No one can slow the passage of time,
nor should we try.
Because without time,
there would be no now.
No moment in the sun.
No moments, period.
Without time,
there would be no life.
Next in the story of our universe,
Earth's seasons.
Like a mother bear raising her cubs...
...we all experience our planet's yearly transformations.
But what created Earth's seasons?
How are they connected to the formation of our moon?
And why does only our planet have conditions just right for life?
When ships are in the middle of the ocean...
...where problems occur...
they can throw you overboard
into the sea.
It is dangerous for you to make this documentary.
There are many risks.
If you're scared of dying, go home.
My name is Ali.
That's me.
And for as long as I can remember,
I've been fascinated with dolphins and whales.
My obsession with the ocean, though,
was really born out of watching documentaries
from people like Jacques Cousteau,
David Attenborough, and Sylvia Earle.
Watching their films opened up a whole new world for me,
filled with an abundance of beauty,
color, and life.
I would dream of one day exploring our thriving seas
just like they did.
Capturing images of all the extraordinary wildlife
that lived beneath the waves.
After finishing college, I'd been working on other documentaries,
but at 22, I was ready to embark on making my own film
on just how incredible the oceans were.
It's home for up to 80% of all life on Earth.
And with the vast majorityÂ of our seas still unexplored till this day,
for me, the oceans were an indestructible source of inspiration.
But not long into starting the project,
this romantic vision that I always had of the ocean completely changed.
...beached whale found off the country's coast earlier this week
had more than 30 plastic bags inside its stomach.
It's the 29th whale of this species to become stranded across Europe
in the last two weeks.
This represents the largest stranding episode in the last 100 years.
- ...washed up on a beach... - In the UK, 4 others died
in a number of beachings nearby in recent days...
When news started coming in of whales washing up on beaches,
even along the Southeast coast of England where I lived,
I was forced to confront a side of the story I never knew.
A story of just how huge our impact on the seas had become.
These animals washing up with their stomachs filled with plastic
was devastating not only because of their incredible intelligence,
but because they even help keep the entire ocean alive.
When dolphins and whales return to the surface to breathe,
they fertilize tiny marine plants in the ocean called phytoplankton,
which every year absorb four times the amount of carbon dioxide
than the Amazon rain forest does,
and generates up to 85% of the oxygen we breathe.
So in a world concerned with carbon and climate change,
protecting these animals meant protecting the entire planet.
The way I saw it was if dolphins and whales die,
the ocean dies.
And if the ocean dies, so do we.
But with so many whales washing up dead, the future looked bleak.
Plastic was invading every last corner of the world's seas,
with huge floating garbage patches accumulating in the middle of the ocean,
like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.
In fact, today,
the equivalent of a garbage truckload of plastic
is dumped in the sea every single minute,
joining the over 150 million tons already floating there.
But this plastic breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces known as microplastics,
which now outnumber the stars in the Milky Way galaxy
by at least 500 times,
and is seeping into every living creature in the ocean.
Essentially, our oceans have turned into a toxic plastic soup.
And worst of all, I was a massive part of the problem.
Although I signed petitions and subscribed to ocean newsletters,
I did nothing to actually protect what I loved.
So from then on,
I did what any self-respecting Jacques Cousteau wannabe would do.
I became the plastic police.
I donated to every ocean charity I could.
Attended beach cleanups,
and carried reusable cutlery and a drink bottle wherever I went.
My mission was simple.
Stop the world from using plastic toothbrushes,
straws, cutlery, bottles, bags,
or anything single-use plastic.
And I was gonna stop at nothing until my message was heard.
Seaside Fish and Chips.
Yeah, hi. My name's Ali.
I'm justÂ wondering if you'd swap out your plastic straws
'cause it's killing whales and baby sea turtles.
Hello?
But that didn't stop me from tackling this plague of plastic.
So, this is my first beach. In just one hour,
I've been able to collect three whole bags full of plastic trash.
There's takeaway food packaging,
there's cutlery, there's straws, there's everything.
I even found Nemo.
Onto the next beach.
But no matter what beach I went to
or how much I collected,
there was always more plastic, and more animals washing up.
After months of this,
and as I began to wonder if this really was the best way to save marine life,
I came across this.
Japan has confirmed it will resume commercial whale hunting,
and is withdrawing from the International Whaling Commission.
The country's whaling fleet set sail for the Antarctic last Tuesday.
Tokyo says it plans to kill despite a worldwide ban.
So, this is the news I woke up to today.
The Japanese government want to resume whaling in the Antarctic again.
I knew that dolphins and whales were dying accidentally from plastic,
but I never dreamed that they'd be targeted on purpose
by an industry I thought only existed in the history books.
I did some research and found there's been an international whaling ban since 1986.
However, several countries have operated under the radar for years,
most notoriously, though, is Japan.
Logistically, it was extremely challenging to film or do anything
about the whaling in Antarctica.
But I found there was one place in the south of Japan
where this industry could still be seen operating from the coast,
in a place called Taiji,
where each year over 700 dolphins and small whales are herded into a cove
for slaughter.
I wanted to find out
just how big of a threat Japan's whaling practices were
compared to plastic.
So I set up a meeting with one of the few activists
who'd been involved in this issue for years, a guy named Ric O'Barry.
The Japanese government go through a lot of trouble
to make sure that people don't know about this.
If you went there, and you didn't know what you were doing,
you could get arrested, and you could be in jail a very long time.
Because they're trying to get rid of people
who are opposed to their war on dolphins.
When you first show up in Taiji,
immediately, the police are on you.
They're at your hotel. They're following you everywhere you go.
You got the Yakuza, you got the right wing,
you got the government, the fishermen, you got everybody against you.
The room is bugged, the telephone is bugged.
The television is actually photographing you
while you're in your room.
So you ask what, how... What happens when you go to Taiji?
Just know that all of those people are watching you,
and they are trying to figure out,
"How do we take these people out?"
But if it's so risky to go,
and there are other issues affecting the entire ocean,
like plastic washing up everywhere, then why go to Taiji?
Showing up in Taiji with a camera is extremely important.
If we can't fix this,
what are you talking about, saving the ocean?
How can you do that? You can't even fix this.
This is the size of a football field.
My head was still filled with questions,
but with the dolphin hunt just starting,
I knew that figuring out what was going on in Taiji
would give me a better understanding of the bigger picture
of how to save the ocean.
Either I stayed home picking up trash on beaches all day,
or take a risk and find out if there was a bigger threat to the sea.
So I dropped all my other projects,
packed my camera bags, convinced my partner Lucy to join me,
and with the mission to expose what was truly happening to our oceans,
got the next flight out to Japan.
Where are you going today?
Oh, we just arrived. We're just visiting the area.
- Holiday? - Holiday. Yeah.
Drive safe.
Thank you.
What the hell?
From that point on, we had an entourage of police,
secret service, undercover cops,
and the coast guard following us everywhere.
Is it the police?
Yeah, they're out there. Let's go out the back.
So, arrived in Taiji,
and first thing in the morning, decided to head to the harbor.
Pretty quickly, boats start heading out to sea.
There was about 13 of them in total, and they were gone for several hours.
When they returned, they returned in formation
and were billowing black smoke from their exhaust pipes.
And banging on poles in the water
to try and scare a huge pod of dolphins closer to land,
and then maneuver them into a cove where I'm standing above right now.
It's impossible to see exactly what's going on.
There's a lot of splashing.
There's people down there wrestling these dolphins.
Whatever is going on, they don't want us filming.
Police are trying to search for us.
It's really tough conditions to try and film this stuff.
The Taiji dolphin drives continue to be supported,
underwritten, funded by the marine park entertainment industry.
A live dolphin really is very expensive.
And so,
the big ticket is catching young dolphins and whales,
and selling them to marine parks.
What captivity in concrete tanks does
is it takes away everything that makes life worth living for them.
Everything they need to do, they can't do.
And everything they don't want to do, they're forced to do.
I had enjoyed going to these marine parks my whole life,
but never even questioned how the animals got there in the first place.
But now, knowing it was connected to industries like whaling
made me pledge to never go to these parks again.
But every day in Taiji was like Groundhog Day,
witnessing boats go out, dolphins driven in,
and the inevitable capture and mass slaughter of the pod
again, and again, and again.
Before we knew it, we'd been in Taiji for over a week,
but still couldn't figure out why on Earth they were killing them,
since dead dolphins don't perform tricks.
Lucy, show me again what you just found out.
I've just been doing the maths from the data online,
and from 2000 to 2015, for every one dolphin captured,
at least 12 more were killed. It doesn't make any sense.
I don't know why they're killing all these dolphins.
So, if the annual Taiji dolphin drive is fueled by the captivity industry,
it begs the question,
"Why kill the dolphins that aren't selected for captivity?"
There's very little reason to slaughter them.
There's no market for dolphin meat.
Why not just release them back into the sea?
And the answer to that question is pest control.
The fishermen view the dolphins as competition.
They feel that they eat too many fish,
and if they get rid of the dolphins,
there will be more fish available for them to catch.
Essentially, the slaughter of these dolphins is a reaction
to the overfishing that's happening here in Taiji.
If this was true, that dolphins were being blamed for the overfishing,
then boycotting marine parks wasn't gonna stop this.
So to find out more, we decided to visit a local fishing port
just a stone's throw from Taiji.
However, upon arrival, we quickly learned
this wasn't just any fishing port.
Ali. Ali, what is it?
This is just tuna.
This is the tuna industry.
We had just stumbled across one of the largest tuna ports in the world,
which landed bluefin tuna,
the most expensive fish on the planet.
Just one of these fish sold in Tokyo's fish market
for over three million dollars.
I had read about these fish.
They were like the cheetahs of the ocean,
warm-blooded, and can accelerate faster than a Ferrari.
But due to high prices, the only direction they were accelerating in
was into extinction.
Today, less than 3% of the species remain.
They were once thriving just decades ago.
It's not just bluefin though, it's all tuna.
There's everything here. This is sold around the world.
This is a $42-billion-a-year industry. And it's at threat from overfishing.
Of course they're gonna blame the dolphins.
The excuse of killing dolphins
for the crime of eating too many fish was a lie.
In reality, what they were doing was killing dolphins
as a scapegoat for the overfishing.
That way, they can continue participating
in the multibillion-dollar tuna industry,
and wash off any ecological responsibility.
I learned one of the world's largest tuna companies
belonged to Mitsubishi,
who control 40% of the world's endangered bluefin.
Since they were based in Japan,
we surprised them by showing up at their head office.
I was wondering if we could do a quick interview.
We have questions about why your company is wiping out an endangered species,
and how that's connected to killing dolphins.
- Our company refused, so... - Yeah.
Your company refuses all interviews?
Yes, all interviews.
We're asked to turn our cameras off, and leave immediately.
Back at the fishing port,
I noticed that tuna weren't the only highly-prized species they were landing.
Sharks were everywhere,
and they were all having their fins sliced off.
Turn off the video!
Shut!
- Camera shut! - Why don't you want me filming?
The shark-finning industry is a multi-billion dollar industry
and is oftentimes heavily criminally involved
and Mafia-esque run.
They don't want people with cameras sniffing around
because they don't wanna get exposed
for all of the shady things that they do.
So sharks around the world are being killed for their fins.
These fins are being shipped to Asia, and predominantly China,
for shark fin soup,
which is held as a status symbol.
It has no nutritional benefits, it really doesn't taste like much,
and it can cost anywhere upwards of $100 a bowl.
Seeing so many sharks finned,
and being kicked out of the port just for filming,
only made me want to learn more.
Since we had discovered all we could about dolphin hunting in Taiji,
we decided to follow the shark story to try and understand what impact
this industry was having on the world's oceans.
Just a hop over the ocean from Japan is Hong Kong,
otherwise known as Shark Fin City.
We arrived to find streets filled with shark fins,
and huge quantities being offloaded from trucks on every corner.
We tried to film the fins up close,
but were met with the same response as before.
Go, go! No, no!
We can't film?
Are you gonna hit me with a chair?
All right, we're going.
- No photography? - No.
- Why? Why you are filming? - Huh?
Why you are taking the photo?
You didn't get any permission.
Delete the photo.
Delete first.
Hey, hey, hey!
Filming in Shark Fin City was proving harder than we thought.
So in order to see these fins up close, we got ourselves some spy cameras.
Wow.
I used to be scared of sharks as a kid.
People should not be afraid of having sharks in the ocean.
They should be afraid of not having sharks in the ocean.
The sharks keep the oceans healthy.
They keep the fish stocks healthy. They keep the ecosystems alive.
They keep the coral reefs alive.
If we don't have these sharks,
if these sharks get finned into extinction,
the ocean's gonna turn into a swamp.
And guess who's gonna die next?
Us.
And a lot of people would think I'd be the last person to stand up for sharks.
I was attacked by a shark after serving 12 years in the military.
I was on a counter-terrorism exercise
in Sydney Harbor, and a bull shark attacked me.
But knowledge dispels fear.
And through necessity, I learned about the plight of sharks
through working within the shark filming industry
over the last decade.
It turned out sharks were just as important
as dolphins and whales
in keeping the ocean alive.
But for the first time ever,
sharks were in danger of going extinct because of us.
Like bluefin tuna, shark populations were crashing,
with species like thresher, bull, and hammerhead sharks
losing up to 80 to 99% of their populations
in just the last few decades.
And it was causing other unlikely species to die out with them.
Over the period that we've been monitoring seabirds,
since about 1950,
the abundance of seabirds has declined by about 70%.
And if you look at how they feed, you can understand why.
And what they do is they kind of lightly dip down to the sea,
and they pick little fish off the surface.
And where seabirds are doing their best
is where predatory fish are driving shoals
of tiny bait fish to the surface, where the terns can get them.
When you overfish the predators,
they no longer drive the shoals
to the surface, so there's not enough food for the birds.
So the loss of fish across the world's oceans is bringing us
into direct competition with whales, dolphins, seabirds, for prey,
and that's causing their populations to decline even further.
Sharks are apex predators.
So they're at the very, very top of the food chain.
They are what I call level one.
They eat level two.
They eat the poor, the sick, the weak of level two.
But when you take away level one,
level two then overpopulates.
And level two eats level three.
So they'll actually overpopulate.
They'll wipe out their food supply, which is level three.
So level two then disappears, and they go extinct.
And it carries on down the food chain,
down to the smallest organisms.
So when we talk about saving sharks and how important they are,
even though people don't necessarily like them,
they are that key to the survival of our oceans.
Around the world, on average,
sharks kill about ten people per year.
Now, comparatively speaking,
we kill 11,000 to 30,000 sharks per hour.
The crazy thing is, almost half of those sharks killed
are killed as bycatch from commercial fishing fleets.
And they're discarded as waste back into the ocean.
Bycatch was all the other marine life
caught while trying to catch a target species.
And I was shocked to learn that every year,
at least 50 million sharks are caught in nets this way,
side by side with our favorite seafood.
Studies estimate that up to 40% of all marine life caught
gets thrown right back overboard as bycatch,
and most of them die before they even hit the water.
So stopping shark fin soup is only half the picture.
The problem is that eating fish is just as bad,
if not worse than the shark finning industry,
because the shark finning industry is strictly held in Asia,
whereas everyone around the world is eating fish.
I refer to bycatch as the invisible victims
of the fishing industry.
The industry will call bycatch "accidental take,"
but there's nothing accidental about bycatch.
It's factored into the economics of fishing.
In those fisheries where we have a better understanding of bycatch,
the numbers can be alarming.
And so to give you one example,
in Iceland, in a one-month fishery,
that fishery caught 269 harbor porpoises,
something like 900 seals of four different species,
and 5,000 seabirds.
And that's just one little fishery in one little part of Iceland.
Taken across the world's oceans,
the amount of bycatch is huge.
What made matters worse was that this destructive fishery
had been awarded for its sustainable fishing practices for years
by the very label I had trusted whenever I bought seafood,
the MSC blue tick.
I contacted the charity who hand out the labels about doing an interview,
but I received no reply.
In the meantime,
I discovered there were already over a hundred different fishing regulations
on paper for reducing this kind of bycatch.
The problem was,
with over four and a half million commercial fishing vessels at sea,
it was a problem governments had practically given up on enforcing.
Apparently, though,
there was one vigilante organization
who are filling this law enforcement void.
A volunteer-run group who sail around the world and into harm's way
in order to protect marine life and bring ocean criminals to justice.
The marine conservation group Sea Shepherd,
who have even sunk 13 whaling and illegal fishing ships,
and rammed a further five, all without harming a single person.
And by getting up close and personal
with the industries that are destroying the ocean,
they have made some shocking discoveries.
One of the recent discoveries that Sea Shepherd has made
is that on the Atlantic French coast
up to 10,000 dolphins are being killed every year by bycatch.
So this is ten times more than dolphins being killed in Taiji,
and no one knew about it.
This has been going on for at least 30 years
because the French government has been very effective in hiding the problem.
People love dolphins,
and most of them have no idea that when they eat fish,
they're actually putting a death sentence on the dolphin population in France.
One of the most shocking things that most people don't realize
is that the greatest threat to whales and dolphins is commercial fishing.
Over 300,000 whales and dolphins are killed every single year
as bycatch of industrial fishing.
Well, what about sustainable labels, things like Dolphin Safe tuna?
For those of us who spend as much time at sea as I do,
uh, we realized that labels often obscure what's really happening at sea.
We caught tuna fishing vessels who had slaughtered 45 dolphins
to catch eight tunas.
And that fishing vessel was working for Dolphin Safe canned tuna.
I had learned some shocking things so far,
but this was just unbelievable.
I couldn't verify these numbers online,
and I was skeptical to Sea Shepherd's claim
against the organization.
To find out for sure, I decided to meet with the organization behind the label,
the Earth Island Institute.
What's the maximum number of dolphins that can be killed in a net
before the tuna is no longer Dolphin Safe?
Zero. One.
So, one dolphin and, you know, you're out.
So can you guarantee that every can is dolphin-safe?
Nope. Hm-mm.
Nobody can.
Once you're out there in the ocean, how do you know what they're doing?
Uh, we have observers on board.
Uh, the observers can be bribed.
Wait, um... Are your observers out at sea often?
On a regular basis, no. Mm-mm.
There's nobody out there witnessing whether they kill dolphins or not.
So how do you know it's dolphin-safe,
especially when they're paying you to license your Dolphin Safe label?
What they're doing is taking the captain's word for it.
They look at the captain's log. He says, "I didn't kill any dolphins."
"Oh, okay. Here's your label."
"That'll cost you blah-blah-blah."
So just... Just so I get my head around this,
um, you have observers, but they're rarely there,
and they can be bribed.
And so you can't guarantee that Dolphin Safe tuna is dolphin-safe?
That's certainly true in terms of, uh, how the system works.
So, what are people meant to do now if they want to protect dolphins?
What we tell them is to buy Dolphin Safe tuna,
tuna that's verified by Earth Island Institute
to be dolphin-safe.
But it's not guaranteed to be dolphin-safe.
Uh, nothing can guarantee it's dolphin-safe.
Um, but if it's not guaranteed to be dolphin-safe,
why is it called Dolphin Safe?
We can pretty well guarantee it's dolphin-safe, yeah.
But you just told me it's not guaranteed.
It's not guaranteed in the same way that, uh...
The world is a difficult place sometimes.
Conflict of interest?
Yeah, I think it's a conflict of interest. I also think it's fraud.
So, I was working for them, and I walked away from that.
I was making more than $100,000 a year.
Free life insurance. Something I can't even buy.
I left that because of their phony...
Dolphin Safe tuna label. I don't wanna be associated with that.
I couldn't believe what I was hearing.
The internationally recognized seafood label
was a complete fabrication since it guaranteed nothing.
At this point, I began to wonder what else was being covered up.
Even the groups that are talking about marine plastic
are highly reluctant to talk about what a lot of that plastic is,
which is fishing nets and fishing gear.
We hear a lot about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch,
and say, "Oh, isn't it terrible? All our cotton buds and plastic bags
are swirling around in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch."
Forty-six percent of it is fishing nets,
discarded fishing nets, which are far more dangerous
for marine life than our plastic straws.
Because, of course, they're designed to kill.
Now, this is so crashingly obvious, why aren't we talking about it?
Why aren't even the plastics campaigns talking about fishing?
How had I not heard about this before?
Fishing vessels discard a massive amount of ropes and lines,
and this was a major problem.
Today, even some of the most remote places on Earth were awash with fishing gear.
Like Henderson Island in the Pacific Ocean,
and Svalbard in the Arctic Circle.
In fact, looking closer at some of the whales that washed up in the UK
when my journey began,
I discovered fishing gear was the main trash in their stomachs.
This was the whale in the room that no one was talking about.
I even found that longline fishing
sets enough fishing lines to wrap around the entire planet
500 times every single day.
Although there isn't a single fishery in the world
that deliberately targets sea turtles,
six out of seven species of sea turtle are either threatened or endangered.
Not because of climate change, not because of ocean pollution,
not because of plastics in the ocean, but because of fishing.
But this is an issue that nobody wants to talk about.
Again, if this was true, how come I'd never heard about it?
All the headlines I'd ever seen focused on plastic straws.
So I decided to look into the research.
A global study estimated a conservative 1,000 sea turtle deaths
from plastic per year.
However, in the United States alone,
250,000 sea turtles are captured, injured,
or killed every yearÂ by fishing vessels.
If a single sea turtle with a straw in its nose went viral,
then why wasn't this front page news?
When I went on the websites of leading marine organizations
who tackle plastic pollution,
I found pages and pages encouraging people
to stop using everything from tea bags
to chewing gum.
But no mention whatsoever
of what to do about fishing gear,
that is if they even mentioned it.
Instead, plastic straws seemed to take up 99%
of what these groups were talking about, which became even more shocking
when I found out plastic straws only accounted for 0.03%
of plastic entering the ocean.
This was like trying to save the Amazon rain forest and stop logging
by boycotting toothpicks.
It was barely a drop in the ocean.
If fishing gear was such a huge problem,
I wanted to know why my favorite plastic organization
wasn't talking about it.
So, according to the Plastic Pollution Coalition,
what is the main source of plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch?
Microplastics.
Uh, for the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, I'm mostly finding microplastics.
Well, the latest study actually showed
that 46% of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch
is fishing nets alone,
and the majority of the other garbage were other types of fishing gear.
So wouldn't that be the majority?
No, I wouldn't say... I won't say the majority
of the plastic in the jar is fishing nets.
Um, it's... it's a lot. It's a... it's a mix of things.
But a majority means over 50%,
and fishing-related garbage
in the patch is over 50%.
So wouldn't that make it the majority?
Yeah. So if the... if the...
If it's close to 50%, that's, um, uh...
Yes, plastic fishing nets.
There is nothing that would compare to that ratio as far as one item,
you know.
Uh, but the overwhelming, uh, thing is
that it's... it's plastic fishing nets.
Is there something that people can do to stop this fishing net trash?
Uh, one thing that you could do is... is, uh, eliminate,
or really, really reduce your intake of... of fish,
and to really let those... Those populations rebound.
But also, that will eliminate as much materials being used
to... to get those fish.
Well, do you know why
this important message isn't on your website?
I... I don't... I don't know. I don't make the website.
I mean, it'd be great for you to talk to Dianna about it.
She's the founder, she's been in it, she's got the...
She could probably give you better answers.
So, Jackie was saying that one of the ways
to tackle the massive problem of fishing nets in the ocean
is to say no to eating fish.
I was wondering why you haven't put that important message on your website.
A consumer message to eat less fish?
Yeah, it's not my area.
- It's not my area of focus. I hear you. - Yeah.
I don't have time. We have an event.
Can you turn off the cameras? Thanks.
I'm not interested in focusing there.
I don't have an opinion about that.
I was talking about what people can do to make a difference
about fishing net trash in the ocean,
and Jackie said to eliminate or reduce fish consumption.
- I asked if that was... - She didn't say eliminate fish.
- She did. - I know she didn't.
...is, uh, eliminate or really, really reduce your intake of... of fish.
- She did. She... - She didn't say eliminate fish.
I had no idea what was going on.
Why was such a simple question
receiving such backlash?
My only option was to follow the money.
So I did.
And sure enough, there it was.
Of course they're not gonna talk about fishing nets.
The Plastic Pollution Coalition
is the same organization as the Earth Island Institute.
These are the same ones who are behind the Dolphin Safe tuna label,
who work with the fishing industry to sell more seafood.
No wonder why they don't talk about the leading cause of plastic pollution
in many parts of the world.
Now, it's entirely right to say
that we must use far less plastic.
But even if not a single gram of plastic entered the oceans
from today onwards,
we would still be ripping those ecosystems apart
because the biggest issue by far is commercial fishing.
It's not just far more damaging
than plastic pollution,
it's far more damaging than oil pollution from oil spills.
The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico
was the biggest in history.
It gushed huge quantities of oil
into the deep sea for a period of months.
And everyone was appalled at the death of wildlife on the beaches
as the oil slopped ashore.
But in fact, the fishing industry in the Gulf of Mexico
destroyed more animals in a day
than that oil spill did in months.
Because large areas were closed to fishing
because of the possibility of being tainted by oil,
marine life actually benefited
from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill
because it got a respite from fishing.
I have a hard time accepting that a fisherman on his little fishing boat
- could be causing all this damage. - Yeah.
So, what's the deal?
There's this image of the fishing industry,
which is deeply implanted in our minds from childhood.
It's a little red boat
chugging across a sparkling sea
with Captain Birdseye at the wheel,
with his white beard, and his twinkly blue eyes,
and his fisherman's cap.
And of course, what it really is, is a death machine.
This is a highly effective, technological machine.
You've got these massively powerful boats, huge fishing ships,
whose purpose is to mop up the animals
which are at the basis of the whole marine food chain,
the fish.
Although I finally felt like I was on the right track,
I couldn't help but feel frustrated
that the constant media and global attention
on plastics and fossil fuels
were distracting from an industry we hear almost nothing about,
with a much, much greater impact on the sea.
Digging deeper,
I discovered this was also true when it came to coral reefs.
With scientists predicting the loss of 90% of reefs by the year 2050,
the only mainstream narrative on why reefs were dying was climate change.
But hardly anyone was talking about the fact fish were vital
to keep corals alive.
The ecosystem on coral reefs is heavily based on recycling.
When these animals excrete, that is food for the corals.
As fishermen come in and catch the fish, not only is the fish suffering,
but the products that the fish release into the water is food for the corals,
and the nutrients to replace them and grow them up again will be lost.
Fishing has become the major threat on many reefs around the world.
From the Middle East to the Caribbean,
where 90% of the large fish which prospered there for millennia
have now disappeared.
So our oceans were clearly at a turning point,
and I needed definitive answers.
I wanted to speak to conservationists
who had spent their lives trying to protect the sea,
starting with meeting a living legend,
and one of my all-time favorite heroes, to tell me more.
I'm Sylvia Earle, an oceanographer,
explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic,
founder of Mission Blue,
founder of Deep Ocean Exploration and Research.
So over the years, I've seen changes.
I've been a witness
to perhaps the greatest era of discovery about the ocean.
But at the same time, the greatest era of loss.
Since the middle of the 20th century,
humans have succeeded in extracting from the ocean,
immense quantities of wildlife.
The estimate is by the middle of the 21st century,
if we keep taking wild fish at the level that we are today,
there'll be no commercial fishing,
because there won't be enough fish to catch.
In the middle of the North Sea in the 1830s,
a typical fishing boat would be able to catch
one or two tons of halibut every day.
But today, the entire fishing fleet there
catches about two tons of halibut across the entire year,
which means that halibut is more than a thousand times
less abundant today than it was then.
We are at war with the oceans.
And if we win this war, we're going to lose it all,
because mankind is not able to live on this planet with a dead sea.
It's the total industrialization of fishing that is the problem here.
We are pretty much destroying everything at rapid speed.
Commercial fishing was essentially
wildlife poaching on a mass scale,
catching up to 2.7 trillion fish every year,
or up to five million killed every single minute.
No other industry on Earth
killed anywhere near as many animals as this trade,
let alone wild species that we barely understand.
This has led to global fish populations,
in some cases, plummeting to near extinction.
But perhaps one of the most shocking facts of all
came from one of the world's leading fisheries experts
estimating that if current fishing trends continue,
we will see virtually empty oceans
by the year 2048.
The more I learned, the more devastating this fact became,
as I began to understand just how interconnected
each species were with each other,
and even the role they play in maintaining the chemistry of the ocean
and our planet's atmosphere.
It sounds just mind-blowing,
but the power of animals moving up and down
through the water column, in terms of mixing,
is as great as all the wind, waves,
tides, and currents in the seas combined.
And this has a huge impact
on the, the physics, the chemistry, and the biology of the seas.
All this churning of the sea
may be one of the ways the oceans help absorb heat from the atmosphere.
As animals swim through the water column,
it creates a powerful down-welling of the warmer surface waters
to mix with the colder waters below.
And although more research needs to be done,
the decimation of marine life may be interfering with this process,
and contributing to warmer sea temperatures.
The bottom line, the oceans and the life within it
play a much bigger role in climate than we ever expected.
And it turns out that the life in the oceans
is absolutely crucial for holding on to carbon
and preventing it from being released to the atmosphere.
We understand that leaving trees or planting trees
really helps the carbon equation,
but nothing matters more
than maintaining the integrity of ocean systems.
I mean, these big animals,
even the little ones,
they take up carbon.
They sequester carbon when they sink to the bottom of the ocean.
The ocean is the biggest carbon sink on the planet.
If you want to address climate change, the first thing you do
is protect the ocean.
And the solution to that is very simple: leave it alone.
I always equate it to this being a spaceship.
The Earth is a spaceship. It's on a trip around the galaxy.
It takes 250 million years just to make one orbit.
And every spaceship has a life-support system,
provides us with the food we eat, the air we breathe,
and regulates the climate, the temperatures.
That life support system is run by a crew of earthlings,
and there's only so many crew members you can kill
before the machinery begins to break down, you run out of engineers.
And that's what's happening, we're killing off the crew.
I discovered that one of the most important crew members
on this spaceship Earth
were actually marine plants.
Per acre, these coastal plants can store
up to 20 times more carbon than forests on land.
In fact, 93% of all the world's CO2 is stored in the ocean
with the help of marine vegetation, algae, and coral.
And losing just 1% of this ecosystem
was equivalent to releasing the emissions of 97 million cars.
By, uh, continued extraction of fish out of our oceans,
you're essentially deforesting our oceans
by not only removing the fish,
but the act of removal,
the methods of removal are devastating to habitat, to ecosystems.
And it's even more so there because it's out of sight, out of mind.
Trawling was by far the most destructive form of fishing.
The largest trawl nets are so big
they could swallow whole cathedrals
or up to 13 jumbo jet planes.
The nets drag heavy weights at the bottom,
scarring the sea floor that were once abundant with life,
leaving nothing but a barren wasteland behind.
This was just like bulldozing pristine Amazonian rain forest,
except it was much, much worse.
Every year, approximately 25 million acres of forest are lost.
This was equivalent to losing about 27 soccer fields per minute.
However, bottom trawling wipes out
an estimated 3.9 billion acres every year.
This was equivalent to losing 4,316 soccer fields every single minute.
Tallied up across the year,
this was equivalent to wiping out the land area
of Greenland, Norway, Sweden, Finland,
Denmark, the UK, Germany, France, Spain,
Portugal, Italy, Turkey, Iran, Thailand,
and Australia combined.
Where are the big environment groups?
Why aren't they all over this like a rash?
It's so obvious.
It's just shouting in our faces.
It is the fishing industry that is destroying the fish
How much more obvious does it need to be?
And yet, for the most part, they are silent.
They're not speaking out against it.
They are deliberately not engaging
with the most important issue of all.
Many, uh, researchers feel
that we should be at about 30% of our oceans being protected.
But, in reality, we're at 5% now of marine protected areas.
But that's misleadingÂ because over 90%
of those marine protected areas still allow fishing.
So in reality,
less than 1% of all of our oceans are being regulated.
We hear a lot from governments
about these marine protected areas.
And one of the government ministers was interviewed and asked,
"In this particular protected area,
what is the additional protection you're actually giving it?"
"Are you gonna protect it against industrial fishing?"
"No."
"Are you gonna protect it against oil drilling?"
"No."
"So, what are you actually protecting it against?"
"Well, we're going to put some more restrictions
on sea kayaking."
Seriously?
Kayaking?
This was the only thing she could come up with?
It's an utter disgrace.
With virtually no marine protected areas that didn't allow fishing,
and global fish populations on the brink of collapse,
I began to question
whether sustainable seafood could even exist.
I have looked long and hard,
seriously, at trying to find an example
of where a large-scale extraction of wildlife is sustainable.
It just doesn't exist.
It's hard to say,
"In some areas, fishing is okay,
and in others, it's not."
Because who will draw the line?
How would you know if a fish is, like, caught illegal,
or is coming out of a sustainable fishing method?
Well, first of all, there's no such thing. It's impossible.
There's no such thing as a sustainable fishery.
There's not enough fish to justify that.
Everything is now sustainable.
It's not sustainable. Just a marketing phrase, that's all.
So don't you agree with organizations
that recommend people eat more sustainable seafood
as a way to protect the ocean?
No, I disagree with it completely.
You know, basically what they're trying to do
is to appeal to the big tent.
They want the people who eat fish to support them.
And this was a problem when I was National Director for the Sierra Club,
that was their problem.
They didn't wanna come out against hunting, against fishing,
or against meat-eating.
Because they thought they would lose membership support if they did.
A lot of these groups aren't interested in solving the problem,
they're interested in exploiting the problem.
There's a lot of groups out there, climate change,conservation, whatever.
It's a business. It's a feel-good business.
I looked on Oceana's website.
They were the world's largest marine conservation group,
but there wasn't a single mention
of reducing or eliminating seafood consumption.
Instead, the organization recommends
one of the best ways to save fish
was to eat fish.
Oceana were advocating for sustainable fishing,
so I decided to meet with the group so they could explain what that meant.
What does sustainable fishing actually mean? Who defines it?
That's a really thoughtful question.
Uh, sustainable...
Sustainability is not defined as such.
There is not a definition of sustainability,
as a whole, for fisheries.
Isn't it confusing, then, to say,
"Eat sustainable fish,"
if there's no universal definition for it?
Uh, absolutely.
No, the consumer can't assess right now, uh, properly
what fish is sustainable, what is not.
Uh, there is full of advices,
but it's true that the consumer can't make an informed decision right now.
So if no one really knows what it means,
wouldn't a more effective strategy be
to, say, reduce or eliminate seafood consumption?
Wouldn't that be the best for the ocean?
That's...
I mean, it's difficult to answer a question
with such a deep reflection
with, uh, so little time to think about, right?
Um, because we don't have a position in that respect.
We're never asked that question.
Oh, it would just be on the website.
You know, "Number one thing you can do for the ocean,reduce fish consumption."
- Something like that. - Um...
I left the Oceana officeÂ with less faith in the group than when I walked in.
Disappointed that they were unable to answer such a simple question
about sustainable fishing.
Perhaps contacting governmental authorities
would better answer my question.
After all,Â it was the second-best thing to do on Oceana's website.
So I went straight to the top
and managed to secure a rare meeting
with the European Commissioner of Fisheries and the Environment,
who was recently passing laws to ban single-use plastic.
What is the definition of sustainable fishing?
Imagine that you have money in a bank,
you have capital, you put, I don't know, â‚¬100 in the bank.
That â‚¬100, which is the capital,
is giving you interest.
As long as you are taking the interest, and spending the interest
without touching the capital,
then that is sustainability.
As soon as you start taking away the capital as well,
then you've entered the unsustainable cycle.
Well, using your economic analogy,
today's oceans aren't only in debt, but they're in a major depression.
Shouldn't we just stop spending what we can't afford?
Obviously, we cannot go to the other extreme, and say,
"The only solution is not to fish at all."
We cannot... I don't think we can do that.
But your government are taking extreme measures
to ban single-use plastic,
when fishing causes far more destruction.
So why is the fishing industry getting special treatment from this?
Yes. For me, the idea is not to stop fishing.
For me, the idea is to do more sustainable fishing. To do more sustainable fishing.
More sustainable fishing
meant doing more of something that isn't working,
and can't even be defined.
I wondered though, with no clear definition,
where did that leave sustainable certification groups, like the MSC,
who still haven't got back to me?
Oh, you mean the Marine Stewardship Council?
- Yeah. - Oh, God.
Getting me onto the subject of the Marine Stewardship Council, you know.
How much do I want to say?
Well, they have certified fisheries
that produce astonishing levels of bycatch.
And those are ignored because the level of kill
is considered to be "sustainable" in itself.
But that's not what a consumer is looking for.
They want to know that no marine mammals are being killed,
no seabirds are being slaughtered,
in order to put that fish on their plate.
The label on the tin isn't worth a damn in some cases.
They make it appear on paper as if, uh, eating,
on one hand, uh, sustainably-produced salmon
is, uh, better than killing a bluefin tuna,
and therefore creates a justification in the eyes of the consumer.
But that's like essentially saying that it's more sustainable
to shoot a polar bear than shooting a panda.
When in reality,
uh, neither one is sustainable, and neither one is right to do.
So, do you think it's gonna be possible
to do an interview with the MSC at any point?
Um, I don't think that's gonna work out.
Um, there's nobody in the office at the moment.
There's loads of conferences on.
After having our interview request turned down countless times over phone,
we decided to visit their head office instead.
Hi, my name's Ali.
I've been trying to organize an interview with someone at MSC for months now,
and I just had some questions about sustainable fishing.
Would there be anyone around I could speak to really quickly?
We were told to wait in the waiting room while they found someone to speak to us.
But after half an hour of panicked looks between the members of staff,
we were asked to leave.
Just got palmed off again by the MSC.
The world's largest sustainable seafood organization
doesn't wanna talk to me about sustainable seafood.
The only thing left to do was to try and follow the money.
And it didn't take long to find the massive conflict of interest.
One of the founders of the MSC
was the Unilever corporation,
who at the time were a major seafood retailer.
And despite countless fisheries clearly being depleted and destructive,
I could only find a couple
that had ever been denied certification in over 20 years.
But most shocking of all
was learning that over 80% of the almost Â£30-million-a-year income
was from licensing their logo on seafood.
Basically, the more blue ticks they handed out, the more money they made.
So as far as I was concerned,
there was no way I was gonna trust these labels again.
In fact other attempts to regulate the industry were also failing,
with government observers
who are given the task of monitoring fishing activity on ships
being murdered at sea, thrown overboard,
like Keith Davis, a 41-year-old American observer,
never to be seen again.
In Papua New Guinea,
18 observers went missing in the space of just five years.
And in the Philippines, in 2015,
an observer by the name of Ms. Gerlie Alpajora
received death threats from the family of a tuna fisherman
who was arrested for illegal fishing.
Soon after, armed men entered her home,
and she was assassinated in cold blood with a gunshot to the head
in front of her two young boys.
When we look at fisheries crime,
we have to look at it within the context of transnational organized crime.
And the same syndicates that are behind illegal fishing
are the same criminal groups that are behind drug trafficking,
human trafficking, and other crimes.
If you get in the way of their business, you are risking your own life.
But also don't be surprised at the extent at which governments will go
to prevent you from exposing
the economic activities that they subsidize at sea.
A subsidy is taxpayer money given to an industry
to keep the price of a product or service artificially low.
And in an increasing number of countries,
more money was going out than the value of fish coming back in.
So if you don't eat fish,
you're still sustaining fisheries
because you're paying for it in your taxes.
So if you think about it, it's really shocking
that we subsidize the fishing industry
somewhere in the region of $35 billion,
which is the same amount that, according to United Nations,
we'd need to combat world hunger.
Subsidies were originally started as a means to ensure food security.
But ironically,
they are now the cause of food insecurity
in many developing regions.
Fishing by the European Union in places like West Africa
is driven by European Union subsidies.
And that means that local businesses can't compete
with the economic might of the European Union.
Really it's just a continuation
of a history of plundering the African continent.
These intensive fishing operations weren't only wiping out the fish,
they were also destroying economies.
In the United States,
up to one in every three wild-caught fish imported
had been caught illegally, and therefore sold illegally.
Stolen, often from countries in most need,
where there are now wars over the fish.
One of the causes for the infamous pirates of Somalia,
now feared across the world,
was actually illegal fishing.
They were once humble fisherman working to feed their families.
But when Somalia fell to civil war,
foreign illegal fishing vessels, the real pirates of today's oceans,
invaded their waters and began taking the fish,
effectively pulling food from their mouths,
giving Somali fishermen no choice but to move into another line of work.
This plundering of the African Coast, though,
was happening across the continent.
And Sea Shepherd was on a daring mission to end this,
working with governments
to track down and arrest illegal fishing vessels
in places like Liberia.
Despite the warnings of traveling to this region of the world,
we decided to join Sea Shepherd
to get up close to the front line of this problem.
We have mostly international fleets coming from countries
and they're pushing further and further away to try and make up for that.
And using more and more sophisticated technology
to increase their catch numbers.
When we look at international fleets,
they come here, and they either fish illegally...
And what they're catching is worth huge, huge amounts,
so it's like a gold rush.
Our coastal waters had now become a free-for-all,
until, quite recently, when we decided to pay attention to that,
and try to police it.
For us, with the military, when we go on these operations,
we assume the highest alert.
We know that it's piracy going on.
So indeed, it's a dangerous operation.
Upon arrival,
it became clear why the ocean around West Africa
was so worth protecting.
It was home to one of the last strongholds of life in our oceans.
Teeming with rare and wonderful wildlife of all kinds.
Countless species journeyed across the Atlantic Ocean
to find themselves in these waters.
A refuge for mating and feeding.
Living in as close to harmony and balance as I'd ever seen.
But there was another species,
journeying to these waters for a very different purpose.
It didn't take long to witness how Sea Shepherd
and the Liberian Coast Guard tracked down and boarded fishing vessels.
Species I had never seen in my entire life
were dying in the nets before I could even appreciate them.
But the scenes continued below deck,
where it became clear that these vessels were more like floating slaughterhouses.
This is the hold of just one purse seiner ship.
And this is just the tip of the iceberg, it goes down the whole size of the ship.
There could be hundreds of thousands of fish.
Seeing how hard it is to get on this ship, you need pretty much a military operation.
Plus, they could be fishing unsustainably, and no one would ever know.
They could sell this as sustainably certified.
So I just don't see how you could possibly enforce sustainable fishing laws
with all these boats this far out at sea.
I just don't see how it's possible.
It's at nighttime
that illegal fishing thrives under the cloak of darkness.
Vessels entering the waters of other countries without detection
and stealing the fish.
But that was also prime time for Sea Shepherd to do their work.
Yeah, we gonna board the vessel, we have to do it as soon as possible.
Copy that.
So, Sea Shepherd have just spotted a boat on the horizon.
It's on the radars.
Could be an illegal fishing vessel.
We're about to go and find out.
The ship was a Chinese trawler.
In its hold were huge quantities of illegally-caught fish.
The vessel was detained and fined.
It was only one victory,
but it sent a clear message to the other ships in the area,
that there were now real consequences to their illegal actions.
Still on the illegal fishing vessel after sunrise,
as the ship was getting ready to be taken back to port,
I saw some men rowing up to the ship.
I remembered the piracy warning from the Minister of Defense,
but these men didn't look like pirates.
Why were they risking their lives in open waters on a small canoe?
Suddenly, I saw this.
They were hungry.
If you look along the coast, these are people who've lived here
from time immemorial.
That's their livelihood, that's their way of life.
But when we allow the industrial fishing to come so close into their zone,
it doesn't give them a chance to get a good catch out of there.
'Cause if he cannot catch what he's supposed to catch
because a commercial vessel has come up and scoop up everything from here,
he's destined to go further out.
These guys are out here without life vests.
It's dangerous. Anything can happen.
You get kicked out of your boat, or your canoe, that's it.
Fisheries workers at sea
have some of the most dangerous jobs on Earth.
In context,
over 4,500 US soldiers were killed
in the Iraq War over the course of 15 years.
But during that same time,
360,000 fisheries workers died doing their job,
as an estimated 24,000 workers die every year.
And West African canoe fishermen
happened to have the highest mortality rates
of any fisheries job on the planet.
Huge numbers of people depended on the fish,
which is now mostly gone.
That's caused a great deal of hunger,
not just on the coast, but up to a thousand miles inland.
So, what do people do for fishing instead?
They'll hunt wild animals on land.
And that has not only had devastating impacts
on animal life on land,
it also seems to have had a very major impact on human life,
because it's the bushmeat trade
which is responsible for the Ebola epidemics.
You can actually stand this up, it's in the scientific literature.
The theft of fish stocks is enhancing
or causing Ebola outbreaks of West Africa.
As our trip in Liberia drew to a close,
I questioned whether there was any alternative fishing method
that could provide some kind of solution
to both the environmental
and humanitarian ramifications of this industry.
And a glimmer of hope presented itself in the form of fish farming,
an industry with the reputation
of beingÂ an eco-friendly way to feed the world
without all the problems of wild-caught fish.
With no bycatch, no illegal fishing,
no sea-floor damage,
no killing of endangered species,
and no dangerous working conditions,
it was exactly what I was looking for.
Yeah, so a lot of people jump to the conclusion
that sustainable seafood comes from farming fish
and not high seas fishing,
but it's really not the case.
Uh, there's so many issues involved with farming fish,
uh, being pollution, disease, and we have to ask the question,
"What are these fish being fed?"
What were they being fed?
The industry claim that to produce one kilogram of farmed salmon,
only 1.2 kilograms of feed is needed.
But when I looked further, I found the feed is heavily processed,
and is made of dried fish meal
and extracted fish oil,
which requires a massive amount of fish to produce.
So in reality, you need many times more fish
going into the farmer's feed
than will ever come out.
So fish farming
was just wild fishing in disguise.
And what made this even more shocking
was the scale fish farming already operates at.
Today, around 50% of the world's seafood
is coming from farms like these.
Huge cages in the ocean containing tens of thousands of fish.
So we decided to leave Liberia
and journey back to the UK, for Scotland,
one of the world's leading producers of farmed salmon.
Since none of the major companies wanted to speak to us,
we decided to meet with some of the industry's whistleblowers instead.
The salmon farming industry in Scotland is extremely powerful.
And we're talking about billion-dollar multinationals,
which have the resources and the skills to dominate the narrative,
and ensure that the only information that gets out
is the information they're comfortable with.
So when I went to document the issues,
ended up making my way out to one of the farms.
And there, I filmed some of the most severe sea lice infestations
that's ever been recorded.
Corin was able to capture footage of salmon being eaten alive
by an infestation of sea lice parasites.
A common reality of fish farming across the world.
It was sad to think that this incredible species,
which had evolved for millions of years
to migrate across entire oceans and navigate up rivers
to reach the exact same spawning grounds they were born in,
were now confined to swim in circles in their own filth.
So, it's estimated that each salmon farm in Scotland
produces organic waste equivalent to a town of 10 to 20,000 people.
And taken together, it's estimated that
the Scottish salmon farming industry produces organic waste
equivalent to the entire population of Scotland each year.
The next activist I wanted to meet was Don Staniford,
who'd been going undercoverÂ to expose the reality of fish farms for years.
And we agreed to go undercover with him.
So, we're here at Marine Harvest Salmon Farm,
and it's disgusting.
This is the... This is the stench of Scottish salmon.
This is where salmon go to die from the farms.
Maybe 50% of the salmon are dying from egg to plate, from hatch to catch.
And this is the Mortality Mountain.
This is a symptom of factory battery salmon farming.
These fish are dying from anemia,
lice infestation,
infectious diseases,
chlamydia, heart disease.
This is welfare abuse.
So, far from being a panacea for the world food problem,
salmon farming is a waste of resources.
It's biological nonsense.
The stench was horrifying.
These weren't the bright orange and pink salmon
I'd seen in the commercials.
So, farmed salmon,
without colorants being added to its feed, would be completely gray,
to the extent that salmon farmers can actually select from a color chart,
much like you get when painting your house.
You can select the pinkness of the salmon that you're gonna produce.
So it wouldn't be for me to say,
but it does seem like people are eating gray fish that's painted pink.
This was the real monster in the lochs of Scotland.
But the environmental impact of farming marine life
didn't end with fish.
One of the world's most important habitats is mangroves.
Now, mangrove forests are absolutely crucial storm barriers.
They protect communities from storm surges, even from tsunamis.
And yet, 38% of the world's mangroves have been destroyed
by shrimp and prawn farming.
However, it's the shrimp feed which is having the greatest humanitarian impact,
because it depends on slavery.
We hear a lot about blood diamonds.
This is blood shrimp.
This recent aerial footage shows a fisherman in Southeast Asia
writing a secret message to the drone,
out of sight of the captain.
Slavery at sea is a massive problem.
I think it's very hard to give precise figures,
precisely because it operates under the radar.
Those people who are driving these abuses,
for obvious reasons, don't want to get found out.
In that regard, I would point to Thailand.
So there are now somewhere in the region of about 51,000 boats fishing
in Thai waters under the Thai flag.
They had to find a way of fishing ever more cheaply to catch fewer fish.
And that's where the inherent vulnerability begins.
Most of those boats would not be economic without this free, cheap labor.
I had no idea when I started my journey that it would lead me here,
but it was hard to believe the fishing industry could be this corrupt.
The information I was finding online was conflicting,
so I wanted to ask the industry myself, at an international seafood expo
open only to industry insiders.
We created fake business cards
for a fake seafood company to sneak in,
which actually worked,
and secretly filmed my interaction
with a representative from Thai seafood.
I was doing some research...
Research?
Research. And I found out that a lot of, uh, Thai shrimp and prawns
are coming from slave labor. People kidnapped...
- Oh, no, no! - It's not true?
No, not true!
- Whoa! So they're lying? - Lying.
- So there's no slavery going on? - No, no.
So why would they say that?
I don't know. You ask them that.
- Yeah. So it's... - Business, huh? It's business.
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, it's business.
I was so fed up by all these companies and NGOs bluewashing the truth,
but honestly, I didn't know what to think.
The only way I could find out for sure
if fishing slavery was still going on today
was by actually speaking to these fishing slaves ourselves.
Would you say there's any safety concerns for me making this film?
The safety concerns are serious.
And I think, ignore them at your risk.
You can see people are being murdered.
So some of those involved are murderers.
Somebody might kill you, and that is possible
if you're foolish, and if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time.
You can be victim of unfair or unreasonable actions by the law
who have been paid, i.e. a victim of corruption.
So you have to be extremely careful,
and the security protocols that you apply
may well mean the difference between life and death.
We arrived in Bangkok
with the details of a halfway home for escaped slaves.
We knew that just by filming these interviews
and shining a light on the criminal activities in the country,
we were putting ourselves and those around us at risk.
Don't film my face.
I can be hunted down for helping you.
All we could do was cross our fingers,
and hope we got the answers we were looking for.
Could you start off by telling me how long you were on these ships for?
I was at sea for 10 years, 2 months, and 2 days.
I was scared, let me be straight with you.
Nobody could get off the ship, there were guards that kept eyes on us.
I was at sea for six years.
I was so depressed I tried to take my own life three times.
When I first met the captain on land, we drank and had a good time.
But once I was on the ship and the ship left the shore,
the captain changed from white to red.
He changed, like we didn't know each other.
He bullied and abused me like we didn't know each other.
He splashed us with boiling water when we were sick and tired,
hit us whenever he wasn't happy by using an iron bar,
and threatened us with a gun.
On the ship I was on,
sometimes they kept dead human bodies in the freezers after killing them.
On my ship, boys dropped into the sea and drowned.
I saw their dead bodies floating on the water surface days later.
I felt sorry for their parents,
they would never know of their son's death.
When ships are in the middle of the ocean, where problems occur,
they can throw you overboard into the sea.
They can just say to the authorities
that you were sick and fell into the sea.
People don't see how we catch seafood,
they only care for consumption.
A lot of the seafood we're consuming today is from slavery,
from forced labor.
I would like to see everyone stop supporting them
if that's possible.
Would you be able to take us to the slave ships,
or is it too dangerous to film?
It's dangerous for you to make this documentary, and film these ships.
If you're scared of dying, go home.
At this point, off-camera,
we were notified that we had to end the interview right then and there
as police were on their way.
Someone had reported us for filming without permits,
and we needed to get out of there immediately.
I was sad to be leaving Thailand so suddenly,
knowing there were young men just like me trapped on fishing boats
who'd never be able to go home.
But after risking our safety, I felt powerless to do anything about it.
Especially knowing the authorities were involved in covering it up.
Back home, it'd been weeks since I picked up a camera.
The gravity of everything had caught up with me,
and frankly, I was overwhelmed.
However, months earlier,
we had booked a trip to the Faroe Islands,
a small archipelago in the North Atlantic that practiced an old form of whaling.
We'd booked the trip back when I thought whaling
was one of the biggest threats facing the ocean.
But after witnessing much greater impacts and the human rights abuses that followed,
it seemed like a step backwards.
However, this particular form of whaling, called a "Grind,"
had recently received attention in the media as a sustainable form of whaling,
claiming the species of whale aren't endangered and that hunting them
caused no environmental damage.
Whales were the whole reason I set out on this journey in the first place,
and I was skeptical about how sustainable it could possibly be.
So we decided to make one final trip to the Faroe Islands,
in the hopes of witnessing one of these hunts
and speaking to a whaler.
Some years on the islands,
a whale hunt may only occur a handful of times.
Other years, none at all.
We patiently awaited news of a hunt for ten days,
until finally, we received the call.
There's a Grind? How far?
Okay.
Hvannasund?
How do you spell that?
H-V... yeah.
Yeah, I know where it is. Okay, okay. See you later.
In the chaos of everything that happened,
I finally understood sustainability.
It just meant that something could continue on and on forever
regardless of how much suffering it caused.
In reality,
the Grind was about as sustainable as you could get.
But I began to wonder whether sustainability
was truly the right goal for how we took care of the ocean.
So, I don't feel like I'm a bad person.
If somebody want to say, "Yeah, you're a bad person for killing a whale."
Uh, I would rather kill one whale than 2,000 chickens.
That's about the same amount of meat.
Uh, so if the world wants to take 2,000 lives,
and we are taking one, you're welcome.
And at that point,
I feel like I'm a better person than many other people
that are thinking about,
"Yeah, we had salmon for dinner last night."
Yeah?
Four people, salmon,
that means two, three salmons killed.
Do you really feel good about yourself killing two salmons
for eating dinner?
Uh, I can follow the thoughts that people are saying,
"If you want to eat, don't kill anything."
Like, just eating vegetables, and fruits, and stuff like that.
I can go along with that,
but I really can't go along with people that are saying,
Uh, "You must not kill Grind."
And then, they are killing or eating other animals.
For me, a fish, a chicken, a whale,
exactly the same value.
It has one life.
And...
some say it doesn't need to be taken for getting food,
but that's what we are doing.
Although I didn't agree with everything he said,
the whaler had a point.
All this time, I had only looked at fish
and other marine life in terms of sustainability and ecological impact,
but I never considered the lives of these animals in their own right,
or whether they could feel.
To me, it's remarkable that the question is even asked that,
"Do fish feel pain?"
As a scientist, it's common sense.
They have a nervous system, fish do.
They have the basic elements that all vertebrates have.
They have the capacity to feel on a level
that I almost can't imagine we can.
We feel pain, we feel touch.
But fish have a lateral line down their sides
that senses the most exquisite little movements in the water.
So you see a thousand fish moving like one fish.
Those who say, "Doesn't matter what you do to a fish, they can't feel anything."
Or that they... Their consciousness, they can't relate to pain,
or they can't sense danger in the future.
Well, they haven't really observed fish.
I think it's a justification
for doing dastardly things to innocent creatures.
It's the only explanation I can think of for treating fish
with such a barbaric attitude.
So you don't eat fish?
Oh, I don't eat fish now, or any animal.
A scientific panel for the European Union
concluded that fish do in fact feel pain and experience fear.
Just like dolphins and whales,
fish can also have complex social lives,
even teaming up with other species to find food.
With research proving, once and for all, the intelligence,Â memory capabilities,
and sentience of these animals,
fish, and even crustaceans, were more like us
than we ever expected.
Fishes probably invented all of the familiar senses to us.
Uh, they've been around a long time.
So they have excellent vision, hearing,
sense of touch, sense of smell and taste.
They have the right kind of pain receptors
for physical, chemical, and heat types of pain,
the same three kinds that we have.
And also, there's evidence that fishes show, uh, curiosity,
perhaps concern, perhaps, uh, fear,
when they can see other fishes being taken out of their tanks,
and chopped up on a block right outside the tank.
It could be family members, or relatives,
or just individuals who they've gotten to like over time.
There's emerging scienceÂ on how animals do use democratic decision-making.
One example is herrings, they have a very curious way of communicating.
They actually fart to communicate.
So, if 60% of the herrings in the school are farting,
then that means it's time to leave, maybe not surprisingly.
But they actually use that as a communication tool.
I can't keep a straight face.
As hilarious as that was,
I'd always been taught that seafood was an important part of a healthy diet,
and I still had some questions.
What am I going to miss out on if I stopped eating seafood?
Well, what you're gonna miss out on,
if you stopped eating seafood,
is you're gonna miss out on all that toxic heavy metal.
Mercury, right?
You're gonna decrease your intake of dioxins and PCBs,
these other, you know, persistent organic pollutants.
The aquatic food chain
is the most concentrated source of industrial pollutants.
The thought of clean fish?
There's just dirty fish and then dirtier fish.
And so if you look at the number one source of dioxin exposure,
of toxic heavy metal exposure, PCB exposure,
of hexachlorobenzene,
plastics compounds, flame-retardant chemicals...
I mean, you name your industrial pollutant,
it's found most concentrated in fish.
Again, because that's just where the pollutants eventually end up.
Mercury is totally a toxicant to the body.
Let's say mercury from some industry pollutes the air or the water.
Small bacteria, plankton, they start picking up on the mercury.
And then, small creatures eat those.
Then you've got the smaller fish eaten by the bigger fish, and so on.
In essence, this is called bioaccumulation.
So there's other things in fish, it's not just omega-3 fatty acids.
Those contaminants oftentimes outweigh the benefits of the nutrients.
A common belief is that fish are the best source
of these essential omega-3 fatty acids,
but people don't realize that fish don't make omega-3 fatty acids.
It's the algae cells that are making the omega-3 fats,
and the fish swallow the algae cells.
And the algal DHA is what winds up in the fish's flesh,
that when we kill the fish, and crush its flesh,
and squeeze out the "fish oil" for the omega-3s,
it was really algae oil in there all the time.
So why not just eat the algae that has those great benefits we're looking for?
Why even mess with the middleman,
and just eat the direct source.
We started New Wave Foods with the mission to disrupt seafood,
not oceans, by creating seafood from sea plants.
So you're not gonna miss out on taste, it's there for you. It's delicious.
But you will miss the cholesterol, there's no PCBs,
no mercury, no heavy antibiotics.
You get the things you want from seafood, but none of the negative things.
Plant-based solutions, I think,
is definitely one of the best options that we have to go forward.
Traditional animal agriculture, raising cows and chickens on land,
have huge impacts in the ocean.
The runoff from those procedures create dead zones in the environment.
And fishing and fish farming, too. So if we can find alternatives
that are just as delicious, just as healthy for you,
but better for the environment, why wouldn't we do it?
My journey had taken me far.
And despite witnessing catastrophic destruction,
I had more admiration for the ocean than ever before.
I felt empowered by what I'd learned,
and couldn't wait to put it into practice.
Although I still pick up trash on beaches,
and have embarked on a project to continue investigating
and reporting on environmental issues,
with so many plant-based alternatives
emerging for almost every seafood product I could imagine...
I realized the single best thing I could do every single day
to protect the ocean and the marine life I loved,
was to simply...
not eat them.
If we protect more and fish less,
and restore that kind of balance
and healthy ecosystem,
they've got a good chance of making it through the tough times ahead.
There is real hope here
because marine ecosystems bounce back so quickly
if they're allowed to.
You would see the reefs coming back,
you would see these incredible shoals of fish returning,
you would see the whales returning to our coast.
This is within our grasp.
We can do this.
The prospects for marine recovery,
for rewilding, are incredibly exciting,
but it can only happen if very large areas of sea
are closed to commercial fishing.
And while governments are not prepared to take action,
and while the industry is basically unregulated,
the only ethical thing to do
is to stop eating fish.
It isn't too late to take the best hope we will ever have
of having a home in this universe.
To respect what we've got, to protect what remains,
don't let any of the pieces escape.
Most of the positive and negative things
that bring about change in human civilization
start with someone.
Some "one."
And no one can do everything,
but every one can do something.
And sometimes,
big ideas make a big difference.
That's what we can do.
That's what you can do right now.
Look in the mirror, figure it out.
Go for it.
â™ª You see the truth â™ª
All right, let's try somethin' else.
Uh, from the top. Ready. One, two, three.
One, two, three, four.
Stay on the beat.
Two, three, four.
That's C-sharp, horns.
Two, three... I see you, Caleb.
Rachel, now you.
Forgot my sax, Mr G.
Okay, she forgot her sax. And now, all you, Connie.
Go for it!
Way to go!
Hang on, hang on. What are y'all laughing at?
So Connie got a little lost in it.
That's a good thing.
Look, I remember one time
my dad took me to this jazz club,
and that's the last place I wanted to be.
But then I see this guy,
and he's playing these chords with fourths on it,
and then with the minor...
Oh, oh, whoo.
Then he adds the inner voices, and it's like he's...
It's like he's singing.
And I swear, the next thing I know...
...it's like he floats off the stage.
That guy was lost in the music.
He was in it, and he took the rest of us with him.
And I wanted to learn...
...how to talk like that.
That's when I knew...
I was born to play.
Connie knows what I mean. Right, Connie?
I'm 12.
I'll be right back. Practise your scales.
Sorry to interrupt, Mr Gardner.
You're doing my ears a favour.
- Hey! - Not you, though, you're good.
He's not.
What can I do for you, Principal Arroyo?
I wanted to deliver the good news personally.
No more part-time for you.
You're now our full-time band teacher.
Job security.
Medical insurance. Pension.
Wow. That's, uh, great.
Welcome to the M.S. 70 family, Joe. Permanently.
Thanks.
After all these years, my prayers have been answered.
A full-time job.
Working man, coming through.
Yeah, Mom, but I...
You're going to tell them yes, right?
Don't worry, Mom, I got a plan.
You always got a plan.
Maybe you need to have a backup plan, too,
for when your plan falls through.
A backup plan never hurts.
Joey, we didn't struggle giving you an education
so you could be a middle-aged man
washing your underwear in my shop.
Walking around with a hole in his pants.
- Yeah, but... - With this job, you'll be able
to put that dead-end gigging behind you.
And Lord knows we need more teachers in this world.
And just think,
playing music will finally be your real career.
So you're going to tell them yes, right?
Please say yes.
Yeah, definitely.
Good.
Hello?
How you been, Mr G?
Uh, it's Curley. Lamont. Lamont Baker.
Hey, Curley! Hey, good to hear your voice, man.
Uh... Listen. You can call me Joe now, Curley.
I'm not your teacher anymore.
Oh, okay, Mr Gardner.
Hey, look, I'm the new drummer in the Dorothea Williams Quartet,
and we're kickin' off our tour with a show at The Half Note tonight.
Dorothea Williams! Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me? Congratulations, man. Wow!
I would die a happy man
if I could perform with Dorothea Williams.
Oh, well, this could be your lucky day.
- Whew, there he is. - Hey, Curley.
Leon skipping town really put us in a bind, man.
- Yeah. Uh, I'll bet. - I'm glad you made it.
My boy, Bishop, said he sat in with you on a set last year in Brooklyn.
Said you were great.
Well, you know, for a coffee shop.
Hey, Dorothea.
This is the cat I was telling you about.
My old middle school band teacher, Mr Gardner.
Call me Joe, Dorothea.
Uh... Uh, I mean, Miss Williams.
It's a pleasure. Wow. This is amazing.
Uh, Joe is Ray Gardner's son.
So, we're down to middle school band teachers now.
Get on up here, Teach, we ain't got all day.
What... What are we playin'?
Uh, sorry.
I zoned out a little back there.
Joe Gardner, where have you been?
I've been, uh, teaching, middle school band.
Uh, but on the weekends, I...
- You got a suit? - Uh...
Get a suit, Teach. A good suit.
Back here tonight. First show's at 9:00.
Soundcheck's at 7:00.
We'll see how you do.
Yes! Whoo-hoo!
You see that, Dad? That's what I'm talking about!
Hey, look up, look up.
You know what that's gonna say? Joe Gardner!
You're never gonna believe what just happened.
I did it. I got the gig. Yes!
I... I know.
Dorothea Williams! Can you believe it?
Hey, pal, you're gonna get hurt!
Just don't tell my mom about this. Okay?
Forget class. I'm in a different class.
I'm in a Dorothea Williams class, buddy.
You know what I'm saying? I'm...
Whoa! Sorry!
What the...
Hello?
Hello?
What the...
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hello!
Hello.
Oh, what's your name, honey?
Uh, I'm Joe. Joe Gardner.
Look, I'm not supposed to be here.
Ah. Must have been sudden for you.
You see, Joe, I'm 106 years old.
Been waiting a long time for this.
- For what? - The Great Beyond.
The Great Beyond?
- As in, as in beyond life? - Yeah.
That's death right there?
Exciting, isn't it?
No, no, no, listen.
I have a gig tonight. I can't die now.
Well, I really don't think
you have a lot to say about this.
Yes. Yes, I do.
I'm not dying the very day I got my shot. I'm due.
Heck, I'm overdue.
Uh-uh, uh-uh. I'm outta here.
I don't think you're supposed to go that way.
This can't happen. I'm not dyin' today.
Not when my life just started.
What was that?
Wait. I'm not finished. I gotta get back.
I don't wanna die!
I'm not done. I'm not done. Run!
- Why aren't you running? - I don't know.
- What's wrong with you people? - I don't know.
I'm not done.
Ahh!
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Help! I'm not done. I gotta get back.
Oh, my... Oh, my goodness.
What?
Ow!
Now, now, everyone,
let's give the mentor some room.
Sorry, new souls. 37, that's enough.
- Hey, everyone, look here. - Quiet coyote.
Shh. Quiet coyote.
Who... Who are you?
I am the coming together
of all quantised fields of the universe.
Appearing in a form your feeble human brain can comprehend.
- What? - You can call me Jerry.
Jerry, okay.
Uh, hey, is this heaven?
No.
Is it H-E-double hockey sticks?
- Hell. - Hell, hell, hell.
- Shh. Quiet coyote. - Hell.
It's easy to get turned around.
This isn't the Great Beyond. It's the Great Before.
The Great Before?
Oh. We call it the You Seminar now. Rebranding.
Hell.
No, no. You're here!
Does this mean I'm dead?
Not yet.
Your body's in a holding pattern.
It's complicated.
I'll get you back to your group.
Come on, little souls, get on up here.
Welcome to the You Seminar.
You are in for a treat.
- Mm, that's weird. - What is it?
- The count's off. - Excuse me?
There's a soul missing. The count's off.
Huh.
Okay, first stop is the Excitable Pavilion.
You four. In you go.
You five, you'll be aloof. And you two, why not?
Oh, wait a minute.
This is where personalities come from?
Of course. Do you think people are just born with them?
So, uh, how do they get to Earth, then?
Well, they use the Earth portal.
Once they get a complete personality, of course.
Hello? Hello?
Goodbye.
Whee!
Whoo-hoo!
Wait, wait, wait.
You sure get lost a lot.
All righty, mentors.
- Just find your name here... - Hello, Jerry...
...and join us inside.
...got a lost mentor for you.
Thanks, Jerry.
Uh, look, I'm not sure I'm supposed to be here.
I understand.
Mentoring isn't for everyone.
You're more than welcome to opt out.
Actually, on second thought,
you know, the mentoring sounds like fun.
I'm glad to hear it. Jerry will take it from here.
Thanks, Jerry. Head right on over there to Jerry.
Thank you, Jerry.
Is everyone here named Jerry?
Good luck!
Jerry, we've got a problem.
Oh, hello, there, Terry.
The count's off.
I seriously doubt that.
The count hasn't been off in centuries.
151,000 souls go into the Great Beyond every day.
That's 105.2 souls per minute, Jerry.
1.75 souls per second.
And I count every single one of 'em.
Yep. I'm aware.
It's my job to keep track of this stuff, Jerry.
I'm the accountant.
And we all think you're doing a wonderful job,
- don't we, everyone? - Absolutely.
Looks good from where this guy's standing.
I'd say no.
I'm always counting. I'm counting right now.
You blinked five times since I started talking. Six.
Right. Since accounting is your job,
why don't you figure out the problem?
- Maybe I will. - Wonderful.
Hello again, Terry.
Don't play dumb with me.
Okay, here we go.
"A."
Hello, there, mentors.
I'm Jerry, a counselor here at the You Seminar.
Now you don't remember it, but you've been here before.
But don't worry, forgetting the trauma of childbirth
is one of the great gifts of the universe.
Here at the You Seminar,
all new souls are given unique and individual personalities.
I'm an agreeable sceptic who's cautious yet flamboyant.
I'm an irritable wallflower who's dangerously curious.
I'm a manipulative megalomaniac who's intensely opportunistic.
Oh-ho, this one might be a handful.
But that's Earth's problem.
You'll notice these souls are all missing something.
What goes in this spot?
Well, these souls need their "spark".
And that's where you come in.
Maybe you will find their spark
in the Hall of Everything,
where literally anything on Earth could inspire.
Or perhaps you'll prefer the Hall of You,
featuring a selection of moments from your own inspiring life.
And just what is this spark?
I know you're all excited to get to work,
so good luck finding the spark.
Find the spark.
Wow, that was informative.
Now, it's time for my favourite part of the programme,
matching you mentors with your soul mates.
Our first mentor is Maria Martinez.
Maria, come on down.
Maria was a rare disease specialist
from the University of Mexico.
I'm cured. I'm cured.
She'll be matched with one of my favourites,
soul number 108,210,121,415.
Congratulations! Off you go.
Our next mentor is Bjorn T. Bargensson.
Dr Bargensson is a world-renowned child psychologist
who was recently awarded a Nobel Prize.
I see pain, death, destruction.
- How about now? - A pretty butterfly.
Dr Bargensson will be matched with soul number 22.
Oh, we're gonna get into this now. Excuse me.
22, you come out of this dimension right now.
How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't wanna go to Earth.
- Stop fighting this, 22. - I don't wanna.
You will go to Earth
- and have a life. - Make me!
22 has been at the You Seminar for quite some time
and has had such notable mentors as Gandhi,
Abraham Lincoln, and Mother Teresa.
I made her cry.
Ignore that.
Put me down.
We're truly glad to have you here, Dr Bargensson.
It is an honour having you prepare 22 for Earth.
I'm gonna make you wish you never died.
Most people wish that, 22.
Off you go. Bye!
Where are we?
That's great progress.
You should be very proud. Step by step.
In celebration of Dr Bargensson's body of work,
we are pleased to present him this honorary...
These past few weeks, I have seen such growth.
So many people I'd like to thank, of course.
Okay, look, I'm sure your life was amazing
and you did amazing things,
but here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna stand here in silence for a little bit,
then we go back out, you say you tried,
I go back to not living my non-life and you go to the Great Beyond.
- No, look. - Talk all you want, Bjorn.
It's not gonna work, anyway.
I've had thousands of mentors who failed and now hate me.
Mother Teresa...
I have compassion for every soul.
Except you. I don't like you.
Copernicus...
The world doesn't revolve around you, 22.
Muhammad Ali...
You are the greatest pain in the butt.
Marie Antoinette...
Nobody can help you! Nobody!
Thanks, but no thanks, Doc.
I already know everything about Earth,
and it's not worth the trouble.
Come on, don't you want to fill out your pass?
You know, I'm comfortable up here.
I have my routine.
I float in mist, I do my Sudoku puzzles,
and then, like, once a week,
they make me come to one of these You Seminars.
It's not great, but I know what to expect.
Look, kid, I'm not... Can I just be honest with you?
I'm not Bjorn Borgenstein
or whatever his name is. I'm not even a mentor.
Not a mentor?
Ah...
Reverse psychology.
You really are a good shrink, Doctor.
Carl Jung already tried that.
Stop talking! My unconscious mind hates you!
Is there any way
to show a different life in this place?
Wait. You're really not Bjorn Bargensson?
It's my life.
Um, excuse me, what's going on here?
Binaca breath spray? Cheap cologne?
Man, who curated this exhibit?
You did.
Oh, my goodness. It's Cedric's rap group. No!
No, don't look at that stuff. Let's look over here.
Dad, I don't wanna go.
I don't like jazz.
Black improvisational music.
It's one of our great contributions to American culture.
At least give it a chance, Joey.
This is where it all started.
This is the moment where I fell in love with jazz.
Listen to that.
See, the tune is just an excuse to bring out the you.
And that's why I became a jazz musician.
It's not what we're looking for.
Wait a minute, that's not how I remember it going down.
Come back when you have something.
- Sorry, Joe. - Sorry, Joe.
We're looking for something different.
Two, three, four.
My life was meaningless.
No, no, no.
No, I will not accept this.
Kid, give me that badge. I'm goin' back to my body.
Oh, yeah, sure. Here.
Unless it becomes an Earth Pass, I'm stuck with it.
Well, what if I help you turn it into an Earth Pass?
Will you give it to me then?
Wait...
I've never thought of that. I'd get to skip life.
So, yes!
But we gotta get this thing to change first,
and I've never been able to get it to change.
Come on. I know all about sparks.
Because mine is piano.
- Really? Nothin' at all? - Eh.
Oh, no, not jazz, just music. I don't like music sounds.
It feels like a little too much.
Well, I'm not going out like this.
Where's that, uh, Hall of Everything?
I'll be right back.
Don't get ahead of yourself, pal.
By the way, why do you sound like a middle-aged white lady?
I don't.
- This is all an illusion. - Huh?
This whole place is a hypothetical.
I could sound like this if I wanted to.
Or sound like this instead.
I could even sound like you.
Life is so unfair.
I don't wanna die. Somebody call the wambulance. Wah!
I just use this voice because it annoys people.
It's very effective.
Don't worry, they're fine.
You can't crush a soul here.
That's what life on Earth is for.
Very witty.
Okay. Here we are.
This is the Hall of Everything.
Whoa!
Yes!
- Whoa. - Congratulations!
So, where do you want to start?
Come on.
Croissants, cakes. Baking could be your spark.
Yeah! But, um, I don't get it.
- Just smell it. - Can't, and neither can you.
What?
You're right. I can't smell.
We can't... We can't taste, either?
All that stuff is in your body.
- No smell, no taste. - Or touch. See?
Okay, I get it. Moving on.
Isn't this exciting?
The fire is so pretty.
I kinda wanna let it spread.
Nope.
Hands are hard.
How about a librarian? They're cool.
Yes, amazing.
Who wouldn't like working at a thankless job
you're always in danger of losing due to budget cuts?
Though I do like the idea of randomly shushing people.
- Look, obviously this... - Shh!
Oh, yeah, that's good.
Meh.
Meh.
Meh.
Meh.
Well, I think that's everything.
- Sorry. - You told me you'd try.
I did. I'm telling the truth.
If there's one thing I'm not, it's a liar.
Unlike Abraham Lincoln.
You're really okay being on a penny?
Well, of course. It's an honour.
Okay, but they put Andrew Jackson on the 20.
Jackson!
What can I say, Joe? Earth is boring.
Well, what else can we do, then?
Because we're running out of time.
Yeah, you know, time's not really a thing here.
Time's up!
Nice try, Bjorn, but no need to feel bad.
22 here can be a bit of a challenge.
Even though I can't feel it, please don't touch me.
So, let's get you to the Great Beyond.
Um, wait. We forgot to try breakdancer.
Yeah! I think that's gonna be my thing.
Poppin' and lockin'. Windmills.
Settling my disputes with dance.
Can we have one more minute to go back and try breakdancer?
Please, Jerry?
You look really good today, Jerry.
Oh, okay. I've never seen 22 this enthused.
Good for you, Dr Bargensson.
Run.
In here.
Here it is.
Where does it lead?
Hey, you ask too many questions.
How about you zip it for a minute, m'kay?
- And we're going there why? - 'Cause I know a guy there.
A guy who can help. A guy like you.
Like me? As in, alive?
Wait, are you actually helping me?
Joe, I have been here for who knows how long,
and I've never seen anything that's made me want to live.
And then, you come along. Your life is sad and pathetic.
And you're working so hard to get back to it.
Why? I mean, this I gotta see.
Okay, let's go.
What is this place?
You know how when you humans are really into something
and it feels like you're in another place?
Feels like you're in the zone, right?
- Yeah. - Well, this is the zone.
It's the space between the physical and spiritual.
Wait a minute. I was here. Today, doing my audition.
This must be where musicians come when they get into a flow.
Not just musicians. Watch this.
O, Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou...
Line!
Oops.
Check this out.
I have been messing with this team for decades.
And the Knicks lose another one.
All right. All right. Where's this guy you know?
I gotta get back to my gig.
- Okay. I mean, he's usually down here. - What the...
Make a trade.
Make a trade. Make a trade.
- What is that? - Shh!
Make a trade. Make a trade.
Run!
Make a trade, make a trade, make a trade!
Oh! Ahoy there, fellow astral travellers.
Good to see you again, 22.
Moonwind, how are ya?
On the brink of madness, thanks for asking.
Hey, got a request for you.
Uh, yeah. I'm trying to get back to my body.
Can you help me?
That's what we do.
We are the mystics without borders.
Devoted to helping the lost souls of Earth find their way.
I'm Moonwind Stardancer at your service.
That's Windstar Dreamermoon, Dancerstar Windmoon,
and that's Dreamerwind Dreamerdreamer.
These weirdos are going to help me get back?
Just wait.
Let's get this lost soul back home.
Make a trade.
Make a trade. Make a trade.
Poor fellow.
Some people just can't let go of their own anxieties and obsessions,
leaving them lost and disconnected from life.
And this is the result.
Make a trade. Make a trade.
Make a trade. Make a trade.
Make a trade?
Looks like another hedge fund manager.
Now, to reconnect to your earthly body.
Whoa. That's me.
Thank you.
What am I doing with my life?
I'm alive! I'm alive! Free yourselves!
It's beautiful!
Whoa. He got back just like that?
So this is all I had to do to get back to my body?
Egads, man!
Joe, are you dead?
No, no. Well, not yet.
Can you help me get back?
We've never connected an untethered soul back to its body before.
But perhaps if we travel to a thin spot...
Yes! All aboard!
Anchors away!
So if your souls are here, where are your bodies?
Well, on Earth, of course.
My body is in a trance in Palawan.
I'm playing the Saraswati veena in Tibet.
I'm a shamanic healer meditating in Berkeley, California.
Mm-hmm. And let me guess, you're drumming, chanting, and meditating?
Yes. Something like that.
I'm in New York City, on the corner of 14th and 7th.
Oh, yeah, that's right up from Tony Tony Tonios.
Yes, precisely.
And what about you? I thought you hated Earth.
Yeah, I'm not stuck with a body.
So I can go wherever I want.
I'm a nobody, get it?
We mystics meet in this glorious landscape every Tuesday.
So many of them. Sad.
You know, lost souls are not that different
from those in the zone.
- What? - The zone is enjoyable,
but when that joy becomes an obsession, one becomes disconnected from life.
Gotta find it.
Gotta find it. Gotta find it.
For a time, I was a lost soul myself.
- Really? - Tetris.
There you are.
We'll have you back in no time.
Now, since you don't have a connection to your body,
you will have to tune back into your physical surroundings.
Close your eyes.
Breathe into your crown chakra.
Do we really need all this?
Yes!
Do you have a piano on board? I could focus with that.
No pianos, Joe. You must focus.
Imagine silence.
Shh.
Now, concentrate on where your body is.
Listen for cues.
That's it. You're doing it.
No peeking. Maintain your meditative state
or you'll break the connection.
Now, see if you can smell and feel where your body is.
I hear a heart monitor.
I can smell hand sanitiser.
Yes. Yes! Good.
I think I can feel my feet.
Hmm. I feel fur.
Did you find a next of kin?
I feel fur.
Did you hear that?
Oh, the therapy cat is working.
Am I close? When can I jump in?
Look! There I am.
There I am.
His heart rate is increasing.
I'll get the doctor.
Mr Mittens, you stay right there.
- What are we waiting for? - No, Joe, don't rush this.
- It's not the right time. - No, it's my time.
Wait, not me!
I did it. I did it! I'm back.
What the...
No.
No. No. No.
I'm in the cat?
Wait a minute. If I'm in here, then who...
- What? - You're in my body!
- You're in the cat? - Wait, wait, that's my body.
- I'm in a body! No! - Why are you in my body?
I don't wanna be a cat. I hate cats!
Oh, it's disgusting.
That Moonwind guy, he messed this up.
Doc, you gotta help me. That's my body, but I'm trapped...
Oh, no, they can't understand me.
They think you're me. You gotta try.
Miss Doctor, we have a problem.
I'm an unborn soul and I wanna stay at the You Seminar.
Yes, well, that drug doesn't seem to be working at all.
No, no, no, you don't understand.
- I'm not Mr Gardner. - Shh!
They're gonna think you're nuts.
I mean, that I'm nuts.
Oh, how did this happen?
I fell into your body because it doesn't have a soul.
Then why am I in a cat?
I don't know!
Is there anyone we can call, Mr Gardner?
A next of kin or friend?
- Tell her no. - Uh, no.
Can you tell me what day it is?
It's the worst day of my life.
I don't wanna be here. I hate Earth.
Tell you what. We're going to keep you here
for observation. Just for a bit.
Perhaps our therapy cat can go to his next appointment.
Okay. Okay.
- You gotta talk to her. - Okay.
Miss Doctor, this body's soul is in this cat.
Stop talking.
So naturally, he wants to stay close.
Uh, keep the cat. Just get some rest.
A lot of it. Okay?
I'll come get Mr Mittens in ten minutes.
Ten minutes? We gotta get outta here.
No way! I am not moving!
I can't believe I'm in a body on this hellish planet.
I have bendy meat sticks.
I can feel myself feeling myself.
Hey! Focus! Listen to me.
We gotta get out of here before they take me away.
Take you away? You're gonna leave me?
No way! That's my body you're in.
Okay, do you think you can walk?
I don't know!
I failed Body Test Drive, like, 436 times.
But will you try?
Okay. Gotta find Moonwind, he can fix this.
I'm a cat. I can make this.
Okay, come on, you're doing great.
Keep going. Keep going.
I'm just gonna rest here for a minute.
No, no, no, no. They'll be back any minute. Come on.
Okay!
In here!
Whoa.
Okay, good.
Now push the down button.
Move your... Nope. Careful.
Those fingers are my livelihood.
Ugh.
Now get in.
Phew!
Okay, what did Moonwind say?
He said on the corner of 14th and 7th.
Yeah, that's Chelsea. Near Jackson Square Park.
Exactly. Wait. How do you know all that?
It's all in this stupid brain of yours.
Hey, hey, hey, stay outta there.
Oh, relax. There's not much here.
Jazz, jazz, more jazz.
Oh, and someone named Lisa. Who's that?
Uh, never mind.
I, um...
It's all happening too fast, you know.
Let's just take a minute and, um...
Come on, let's go. They could be here any second.
Don't worry, it's okay. Just keep walking.
Aah!
No, don't stop. What are you doing?
This is New York City.
You don't stop in the middle of the street. Go, go, go.
Oh, no. 22. 22!
22. Oh, no. Oh, no. 22. 22.
22! 22!
22, I didn't know I had claws, okay?
Look, I'm sorry. But come on, let's go.
No way.
I am staying right here until your stupid body dies.
Which will happen any minute now because your stomach is earthquaking.
Yeah, this place is worse than I thought.
It's loud, and bright, and...
Hmm. What is that in my nose?
That's smell.
And if you think that's good, just imagine what it tastes like.
Hmm.
Go on.
It's so good!
It's, uh...
It's not horrible.
Good. You can eat on the way. Let's go.
Or you just take a few minutes. Sure.
Hmm. Strange, I don't feel so angry anymore.
That's great. Ready to find Moonwind?
Maybe.
I'm telling you, Joe, it's pronounced yee-row.
Yeah, but in New York, we call them gyros. It's Greek.
No, I got in a fight with Archimedes about this.
He said it's...
- Yee-row. - Yo-yo.
- Yee-row. - YOLO.
- Yee-row. - Sergio?
Yee-row!
I miss that guy.
This is 14th and 7th.
That's gotta be him.
Moonwind, you gotta help me.
Joe! You made it into your body.
No, he didn't.
That is my body.
You're in a cat?
That's marvellous!
Hey, Moonwimp!
That sign won't spin by itself, hear me?
But, Marge, look! I put this man's soul in a cat.
Who cares? And you!
We only have room for one weirdo here, so, scram!
Get back to work!
No one understands my art.
Moonwind, listen,
I gotta get out of here and back in there.
Well, we'll have to perform
an old-fashioned astral transmigration displacement.
- A what? - It's simply a way
to get your souls back where they belong.
And it's a glorious ritual, indeed,
full of chanting, dancing, and best of all, bongos.
I need to be at The Half Note by 7:00, so this needs to happen right now.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Not so fast.
You must wait for another thin spot
to open between Earth and the astral plane.
And that won't occur
until Orcus moves into the house of Gemini.
When is that?
Well, the government calls it 6:30.
Look, I'll meet you at The Half Note.
6:30? You serious?
I'll gather all the necessary provisions...
I said, get out of here! Go!
See you at The Half Note at 6:30!
I'll take care of everything!
And stay away!
Sure are a lot of Garcias in here.
You're out there somewhere, little soul,
and I'm gonna find ya.
All right, this is the last snack.
I can barely fit into my pants as it is.
6:30 is cutting it close. Too close.
We gotta get back to my place and get you cleaned up and...
Ahh!
We gotta hail a cab. Hold your hand out.
Hold it up and out.
Man, this would be hard even if I wasn't wearing a hospital gown.
Go, go, go! Just run to that one.
Is that Teach?
Mm, pepperoni.
Aah, Dorothea Williams saw me.
What am I gonna do? She's gonna think I'm crazy.
Maybe you should call her up
and tell her that we're not crazy.
I've only been a person for an hour, and even I know that's a bad idea.
I just gotta get back in my body and really bring it tonight.
How come this part is stinky but this part smells fine?
Never mind. Just put those pants on.
Sheesh, I can't believe I've been
walking around in this city with no pants on.
I don't even wanna be here, remember?
I don't want you here either. I just...
I just wanna get back to my body,
then get back to the club.
What's the matter with you?
Uh... I don't know. It's the sun. It's just so...
My phone!
Um... Okay, your clothes are rumbling again.
Curley! Uh... No, no.
Hey, Mr G, it's Curley. Um...
I hope you're doin' okay.
Dorothea freaked out when she saw you, and she called this other guy, Robert.
He's got the gig now. I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
Look, honestly,
your class was the only reason I went to school at all.
Like, I owe you a lot.
So, here's the plan.
Clean yourself up, put on a killer suit,
and get to the club early.
I'm gonna try and talk to her.
Just make sure you show up looking like a million bucks, all right?
I hope I see you, man. All right. Peace.
Oh! I can get the gig back, 22.
I need your help. I have a suit.
I'm gonna need you to try it on.
No, no, no.
And then I can line my hair up a little bit,
- and I can... - Nope. No way, no how.
22!
- Mr Gardner? - Ah!
It's Connie. She's here for her lesson.
- What do I do? - I can hear you!
Just tell her that you can't do it today.
Hi, Connie.
Sorry, but Joe can't do it today.
- You're Joe! - I mean, me.
Me can't do it today.
Good. Now let's go check out that suit.
I came to tell you that I quit.
Quit?
We don't have time for this. The suit is in the closet.
Band is a stupid waste of time.
This kid is talking sense.
What are you doing?
Here, I quit. I think jazz is pointless.
Oh, yeah, jazz is definitely pointless.
Hey!
In fact, all of school is a waste of time.
Of course. Like my mentor, George Orwell, used to say,
"State sponsored education
"is like the rattling of a stick inside a swill bucket."
Yeah!
The ruling class's core curriculum stifles dissent.
It's the oldest trick in the book.
What are you talkin' about?
She doesn't care about any of that.
I've been saying that since the third grade.
You know, you seem really smart.
What is your position on pizza?
- Uh, I like it? - Me, too!
What are you doing?
I'd rather hang with Connie.
What? Come back here! You open this...
Um, I think your cat wants to get out.
Ugh, he thinks he knows everything.
22! Don't you walk away from me.
Come here right now.
I'm gonna go in and I'mma scratch up the sofa.
Oh, wait a minute, that's my sofa.
You really got things figured out, Connie.
I'd better give this back. It belongs to the school.
Sure.
You know, I really am glad there's someone else
who sees how ridiculous this place is.
You're right to quit. I learned about quitting...
You know what, Mr G?
I was practising this one thing yesterday
and maybe you can listen to it and tell me to quit after, okay?
Uh, okay.
Wow. You really love this.
Yeah.
So, maybe I'd better stick with it?
Yeah.
Bye, Mr G.
See you next week!
22!
So, Connie came here to quit,
but then she didn't.
22, forget about that. Listen.
I need to know this, Joe. Why didn't she quit?
Because she loves to play.
She might say she hates everything, but trombone is her thing.
She's good at it.
Maybe trombone is her spark, I don't know.
Please. If I'm gonna get this gig back, I need your help.
Okay.
Really?
I'll help you, but I wanna try a few things.
'Cause I don't know,
some of it's not as boring as it is at the You Seminar,
and if Connie can find something she loves here,
maybe I can, too.
- Great! - So, what do we do first?
- This water hurts! - It's okay.
You just have to turn the other knob.
Oh, okay, that's better.
And I wouldn't be mad
if you put a little lotion on me when you're done.
I washed your butt for you.
Ah! Spicy! Spicy!
You five will be insecure.
And you 12 will be self-absorbed.
We really should stop sending so many through that pavilion.
Found him!
See that, everybody?
Who figured out why the count's off?
That's right, Terry did.
It's Terrytime.
- Wow. Nice work. - Well, who is it?
Right.
Uh... Joe Gardner is his name.
Looks like he's back down on Earth.
That's not good.
That... That's the mentor we set up with 22.
All right, all right. Easy on the hysterics.
Terry's got this under control. I'll handle it.
How?
I'll go down there and get him.
Set the count right, lickety-split.
Okay, whoa. Are you sure that's a good idea?
Look, you all are the ones who beefed it.
I'm trying to un-beef it.
But you cannot be seen.
By anyone.
Don't worry. I'll make sure no one else sees me.
I'll move among the shadows, like a ninja.
Please, just do it quickly and quietly.
And also quickly. And quietly as well.
This won't be a disaster, that's for sure.
Mm. Trusty old brown suit. Still a perfect fit.
It's a little tight in the back-here part.
It'll loosen. Sit down.
I'm a cat.
I'll do it.
You couldn't call an elevator, remember?
No way. I just need to line me up. Now be still.
Uh, it's like a little tiny chainsaw.
- Don't move. - I'm not moving. You're moving.
Oh, no!
Don't worry, I'm okay.
Oh, no, no, no! My hair! My hair is not okay!
This is a disaster!
We gotta fix this. Right now.
- Okay. How? - We gotta go see Dez.
Great. Who's Dez?
Yo, Ian, man, how you get
that big peanut head? What happened to you?
Man, shut up, man. You know I'm sensitive about that.
Dez is the guy in the back.
He can fix this.
Talk about havin' a spark.
This guy was born to be a barber.
But I can't pass for you in front of all your friends.
Dez is the only one that I talk to.
We usually talk about jazz,
but this time, just sit there, get the cut, and get out.
Hey, Joe. What are you doing here on a weekday?
You didn't call for an appointment, man. It's gonna be a while.
Ah, I was afraid of this. Go ahead and sit down.
Oh, my Lord.
You gotta wait, son. This is an emergency.
What? That ain't cool, Dez.
You could always let Harold cut your hair.
His chair's wide open.
Nah. I can wait.
Joe, get your butt in this chair now.
Should I even ask you how this happened?
- The cat did it. - Stop sounding insane.
I mean, um, I was distracted
getting ready to play with Dorothea Williams tonight.
Dorothea Williams? That's big time, Joe.
Congratulations!
Joe ain't getting no gig, Dez.
You know he Mr Close-But-No-Cigar.
This guy.
Joe, ignore him. Now let's fix you up.
You keeping that cat on your lap?
Is it okay that I do that?
Suit yourself. You're the boss.
- I am? - When you're in this chair,
yeah, you are.
So can I have one of those?
Uh... Sure, Joe.
Cool.
Mmm. I like being in the chair.
Hey, get your head in the game.
Little chainsaw.
You need to settle down. If you keep this...
Look, I can deal with some freaky stuff,
but if this cat don't chill,
we're gonna have to put it outside.
Well, what's it gonna be, kitty?
Meow.
Sometimes, change is good.
You have been rocking that same style for a while.
Well, Dez, for hundreds of years, I've had no style at all.
You can say that again.
Mmm. But then my life changed.
Oh, yeah? What happened?
I was existing as a theoretical construct
in a hypothetical way station
between life and death.
I heard that.
And by the time I got to mentor number 266,
I was seriously asking, like, what is all the fuss about?
Like, is all this living really worth dying for?
You know what I mean?
I never knew you had such an interesting education, Joe.
I just thought you went to music school.
And another thing, they say you're born to do something,
but how do you figure out what that thing is?
I mean, what if you pick up the wrong thing?
Or somebody else's thing, you know?
- Then you're stuck. - Been there before.
I'll take one of those.
I wouldn't call myself stuck,
but I never planned on cuttin' heads for a livin'.
Wait, but you were born to be a barber, weren't you?
I wanted to be a veterinarian.
So, why didn't you do that?
I was plannin' to when I got out of the Navy.
Then my daughter got sick,
and barber school is a lot cheaper
than veterinarian school.
Well, that's too bad.
You're stuck as a barber and now you're unhappy.
Whoa, whoa, slow your roll there, Joe.
I'm happy as a clam, my man.
Not everyone can be Charles Drew inventing blood transfusions.
Or me, playing piano with Dorothea Williams.
I know.
You are not all that.
Anyone could play in a band if they wanted to.
Don't pay Paul any mind.
People like him just bring other people down
so they can make themselves feel better.
Oh, I get it.
He's just criticising me to cover up the pain of his own failed dreams.
You cut deep, Joe.
I wonder why sitting in this chair makes me want to tell you things, Dez.
That's the magic of the chair. That's why I love this job.
I get to meet interesting folks like you,
make them happy, and make them handsome.
Wow! Am I crazy or do I look younger?
I may not have invented blood transfusions,
but I am most definitely savin' lives.
I don't know about this crazy cat guy thing, man,
but it is nice to finally talk to you about something other than jazz, Joe.
Huh. How come we, um, never talked about your life before?
You never asked.
But I'm glad you did this time.
- Looking good, brother. - Have a great show.
I grabbed a couple of road lollies.
Dr Charma, call 3-1-6-2.
Julia Child didn't succeed till she was 49.
Hey, Paul. Here, have a lollipop.
Oh, yeah, thanks. Thanks, man.
There you are.
No hard feelings, right? All right.
Just friends.
Just friends goofing on each other. All right.
Okay. Goodbye, Paul.
Come to Terry.
Gotcha!
Thought you could cheat the universe?
Well, you thought wrong.
I'm the accountant, and I'm here to bring you in...
Oh, whoa... You're not Joe Gardner.
My mistake.
We'll just get you back into your meat suit.
There you go.
No harm, no foul.
Oh, boy. Look, uh, fella,
I'm thinking there's no reason
we can't keep this little incident between us, eh?
Mistakes happen. And, uh, it's not your time.
Unless you keep eating
those processed foods, am I right?
But seriously, stay away from those processed foods.
You know what, you did all right back there.
How did you know how to deal with Paul?
I didn't. I just let out the me.
Hey, like you said about jazz. I was jazzing.
First of all, "jazzing" is not a word.
And second, music and life operate by very different rules.
It says take one.
Don't... Or do. Okay. Fine.
"Man with a van."
I got a few in case we need a lot of vans.
Uh-huh. Now, let's get back to the plan.
We go to The Half Note and wait there for Moonwind.
It's around 4:00 p.m. now...
You know what?
You are really getting good at using those legs.
Why don't you try runnin'?
Hey! I made a song. I'm jazzing.
Okay, enough of the jazzing and everything like that.
We need to get somewhere. Now, I...
- That tickles. - Uh, what are you doing?
Whoops. I got it.
Would you hurry up?
Okay.
You were right. These pants are loosening.
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't let people see your butt!
- It's your butt. - It doesn't matter whose butt...
Take off the jacket. Tie it around your waist.
Quick! Cover the butt!
What are we gonna do?
I can't find a tailor this late...
Oh, no. We're gonna have to go to Mom's.
Okay.
No, no, no, you don't understand.
Mom doesn't know about this gig.
And she's not gonna like it.
Okay.
We don't have any other choice.
Okay.
She's the only one that can fix this.
- Okay. - Stop saying "okay"!
We gotta catch the subway across town. Come on.
Okay... Got it.
My mom doesn't know anything about the gig,
and I wanna keep it that way, okay?
Right, because she thinks you're a failure.
- What? - I didn't say that.
You did. Up here.
Uh, look, my mom has her own definition of what success is,
and being a professional musician isn't it.
So, let me see, I need the suit fixed for a, uh, school band recital.
I'm not looking forward to this, but there's no reason she needs to know...
I don't know. All the times I've been
so close to getting to my dreams,
something always gets in the way.
You know what I mean?
How true lovin' began
He's good.
And I've heard music before, but I've never felt like this inside.
Of course, you love music now, because you're me. Let's go.
Whoa!
Hey, take it easy, eh?
I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.
It's the subway. It does that to some people.
- Does what? - It wears you down.
It stinks. It's hot. It's crowded.
Every day the same thing, day in and day out.
But once I get on the stage tonight,
all my troubles are going to be fixed.
You're gonna see a brand-new Joe Gardner.
Where'd you get that?
Under the seat. Can you believe it?
It's still half-full.
All right, remember,
I need the suit fixed for a band recital. Got it?
- Joey! Oh, baby boy... - Joey!
- Oh, I'm so proud of you. - ...we heard the news.
Oh, crap. She knows.
Your momma's in the back.
- You gotta go in there. - No, I don't want to.
You have to. We need the suit fixed.
You forgetting something, Joey?
- What? - Kiss her.
I always kiss Melba when I see her.
Just do it.
No, no, no. Not on the lips.
Joey! What has gotten into you, boy?
Let him finish.
Cougar. I knew it.
I'll take another kiss when you get back, Joey.
So much for being done chasing after gigs, huh?
I hope that cat isn't supposed to be some kind of peace offering.
Come. Come on.
Just say you rescued it.
Um, no. It's mine. I rescued it.
Hmm. Too bad you can't rescue your career.
Just ask her nicely if she can fix my suit.
So, Mom, is there any way you can fix this?
Whoa! I don't need to see that.
I know. Embarrassing, right?
So, you'll fix it?
- No. - What?
How long are you going to keep doing this, Joey?
You tell me you're going to accept the full-time position...
Here it comes.
...and instead, I hear you've taken another gig.
Tell her that this one is different.
This one's different!
Does this gig have a pension? Health insurance?
No? Then it's the same as the other ones.
It's like you can't even be truthful with me anymore.
Fine, we'll get the suit off the rack somewhere.
My mom has never understood what I'm trying to do with my life.
Fine, we'll get the suit off the rack somewhere.
My mom has never understood
what I'm trying to do with my life.
- 22! - What did you just say?
Oof. Can I run away now, like you usually do?
No. Not this time. Repeat after me.
Mom, I know we've had some rough times,
but you're right,
I can't be truthful with you.
Because it seems like no matter what I do, you disapprove.
Look, I know you love playing.
Then how come except for church, you're the happiest when I don't?
I finally land the gig of my life and you're upset.
You didn't see how tough being a musician was on your father.
I don't want to see you struggle like that.
So Dad could pursue his dreams, and I can't?
Your father had me.
Most times, this shop is what paid the bills.
So when I'm gone, who's gonna pay yours?
Music is all I think about.
From the moment I wake up in the morning
to the moment I fall asleep at night.
You can't eat dreams for breakfast, Joey.
Then I don't want to eat.
This isn't about my career, Mom.
It's my reason for living.
And I know Dad felt the same way.
I'm just afraid that if I died today,
that my life would've amounted to nothing.
Joey.
Let's make this work instead.
That's my dad's suit.
Lulu. Melba.
Bring your good scissors in here. We got work to do.
Wow. This feels really nice.
- You look marvellous. - It fits perfectly.
You see how I did that?
That is one fine wool suit, if I do say so myself.
- Can I try on that? - Of course you can.
Just handsome.
Thank you, uh, Mom.
Ray would have been so proud of you, baby.
Like I've always been.
You heard me, right?
The suit is wool, not polyester.
So, don't go putting that cat on your shoulders again.
Yes, ma'am!
Oh, there's a nice little taper there.
Thanks, Mom.
Oh, that was amazin'.
You know what that felt like? It felt like jazz.
Yeah, you were jazzing.
Ha-ha. Okay, jazzing.
I'm telling you, Joe.
You really should call Lisa again.
I don't really have time for a relationship right now, 22.
Oh, busy right now?
Wanna wait till you die a second time?
Cool, cool, cool.
I can't believe I'm getting romantic advice
from an unborn soul.
I can think of worse.
There it is.
We made it! This is going to work.
Whoa! I can't believe how good I look.
The suit, the cut. Just look at me.
- Ooh, just turn a little bit right there. - Like this?
- Angle the shoulders, and... - Oh, hey, who's that?
- And from this side. - That's it.
What? Who's back here?
- Still me. Uh-huh. - That's a winner.
Right?
This can't be happenin'. Now, I'm not gonna believe this.
The Half Note.
He made you pay for dinner?
Yeah...
- So, you ready? - Huh?
To go home.
I bet you're ready to get off of this stinky rock, huh?
What do you think of Earth, anyway?
I always said it was dumb. But...
I mean...
Just look at what I found.
Your mom sewed your suit from this cute spool.
When I was nervous, Dez gave me this.
A guy on the subway yelled at me. It was scary.
But I kind of liked that, too.
Truth is, I've always worried
that maybe there's something wrong with me. You know?
Maybe I'm not good enough for living.
But then you showed me about purpose and passion,
and maybe sky-watching can be my spark.
Or walking. I'm really good at walking.
Those really aren't purposes, 22.
That's just regular old living.
But, hey, when you get back to the You Seminar,
you can give it an honest try.
No, but I've been at the You Seminar for thousands of years
and I have never felt this close.
Joe! Who's ready to go home?
Moonwind.
The stars are almost in alignment.
All right.
I'll have you back in your bodies in no time.
No. I've gotta find it here, on Earth.
This is my only chance to find my spark.
22, you're only loving this stuff because you're in my body.
You can find your own thing to love when you get back to the You Seminar.
Now, come on, I need my body back. Now!
No.
I'm in the chair.
- 22! - Leave me alone!
I'm trying to find my purpose!
22, you come back here!
22!
Mr Mittens.
Oh.
{\an8}There they are.
You come back here right now!
You stole my body!
It's your time to go, Joe Gardner.
Oh, no, you don't.
Gotcha!
No, no, no.
No, no!
I was gonna play with Dorothea Williams!
And I was about to find my spark!
Find your spark? My life was finally going to change!
You promised, but you wouldn't even give me five minutes!
I lost everything because of you!
Joe!
You cheated.
Found him.
- Joe Gardner. - You're back!
Terry, you found them.
No need to thank me.
It's so nice to have everything back in order, and...
22 got her pass?
- Oh, my goodness. - 22! You got an Earth Pass!
This is amazing!
I knew you could do it.
This is cray cray.
But what... What filled in the last box?
I'll tell you what filled it in. I did!
It was my spark that changed that badge.
She only got that because she was living my life in my body.
- I was... - Come on, Mr Gardner.
Joe, it's time for you
to accompany 22 to the Earth portal.
Give you a chance to say goodbye.
Of course. It's standard procedure.
Just hold on a minute. I get to set the count right.
Terry, you have done a super job.
We'll take it from here.
You're amazing.
Well, thank you.
Terrytime.
Go ahead, you two.
You don't know.
You can't be sure why my pass changed.
Come on, 22. Think about it.
You hated music until you were in my body.
You hated everything until you were me.
I hope you enjoy it.
Uh...
I have to ask, how the Dickens did you do it?
Get that Earth Pass to change?
Oh. You know what, I... I just let her walk
a mile in my shoes, you could say.
Well, it worked.
Yeah.
Well, you should probably get going to the Great Beyond.
Hey, um, we never found out what 22's purpose was.
- Excuse me? - You know, her, uh, spark.
Her purpose. Was it music? Biology? Walking?
We don't assign purposes. Where did you get that idea?
Because I have piano.
It's what I was born to do. That's my spark.
A spark isn't a soul's purpose.
Oh, you mentors and your passions.
Your purposes. Your meanings of life. So basic.
No, no, it...
It is music. My spark is music. I...
I know it is.
I'm no good.
I got no purpose.
No purpose.
No purpose.
Mr G?
Curley, I made it. I'm ready to go.
You're too late, man.
Let me talk to Dorothea.
No, no, no, man. She don't play that.
These rappers act like... Who let this lunatic in here?
Listen, you gotta give me another chance.
This is my band. I decide who plays.
And if you don't go with me,
you'll be making the biggest mistake of your career.
Oh, yeah? Why's that?
My only purpose on this planet is to play.
It's what I was meant to do. And nothing's gonna stop me.
Well, aren't you an arrogant one?
I guess you really are a jazz player.
Tell Robert he's out. For now.
Nice suit.
Get ready, Joe Gardner, your life is about to start.
Welcome to the quartet, Teach.
That's my Joey!
- What a show! - That last solo was brilliant.
That was amazing!
I'm not gonna cover that bridge for you again.
- Whoo! Later, Mr G. - Congratulations.
You did great. We love you.
I'm so proud of you, Joey.
Gotta get to bed. We old.
You play 100 shows, and one of them is killer.
You don't get many like tonight.
Yeah.
So, uh, what happens next?
We come back tomorrow night and do it all again.
What's wrong, Teach?
It's just I've been waiting on this day for my entire life.
I thought I'd feel different.
I heard this story about a fish.
He swims up to this older fish and says,
"I'm trying to find this thing they call the ocean."
"The ocean?" says the older fish.
"That's what you're in right now."
"This?" says the young fish. "This is water.
"What I want is the ocean."
See you tomorrow.
- Hey, man. - Sorry.
Maybe sky-watching can be my spark.
Or walking. I'm really good at walking.
Those really aren't purposes, 22.
That's just regular old living.
- Joe? - Huh?
Joe!
Good heavens, man. What are you doing in the zone?
Moonwind. I messed up. I need to find 22.
I'm afraid she's become a lost soul.
- What? - I'll explain on the way.
When neither of you returned to The Half Note,
I suspected something had gone wrong.
I came back here, and that's when I spotted her.
Lost souls are obsessed by something that disconnects them from life.
And now that 22 has technically lived, she's become one of them.
- There! - Good show.
22!
- Ready the net. - I'm on it.
She's got us!
Moonwind!
A captain always goes down with the ship.
It has been a...
22!
Come back, 22. It's me, Joe.
Easy, 22, easy.
I just came back to give you this.
Easy.
22, listen. Come back!
And for correcting our absent-minded mistakes
and setting the count right,
we are awarding you, Terry, this trophy. As you requested.
I am happy to accept this very special award I requested,
but that I absolutely deserve.
Joe Gardner?
And I'll just take that back.
Hey.
Oi, noob! You're not where you belong.
22, stop. I have something to tell you.
Stop that. No.
22!
Whoa, watch out!
Take it easy.
- There, there. - There's no need to be afraid.
Don't worry. Calm down.
You have to stop running. Please.
22, stop.
22, I was wrong.
Please, will you listen? You are ready to live, 22.
I'm not good enough. Nope. No.
Nothing. I just need to fill out that last box.
22!
You're dishonest.
All you make are bad decisions.
You are unwise and you won't make it in the world.
You're so selfish.
No one would ever want to be around you.
Loser.
Oh, the world needs remarkable people
and you are the least remarkable soul I've ever met.
You'll never find your spark.
Imbecile.
I cannot help you.
22!
I just need to fill out that last box.
I'm not good enough at all.
You will never find your spark.
There's no point.
Those aren't purposes, you idiot.
That's just regular old living.
This is a waste of time.
You only got that badge because you were in my body.
That's why you ruin everything.
Because you have no purpose.
No, no, no.
There's no point.
You'll never find your spark.
Because you have no purpose!
I'm not good. Nope.
Nothing. I just need to fill out that last box. I give up.
You ready?
To come live.
I'm scared, Joe.
I'm not good enough.
Anyway, I never got my spark.
Yes, you did.
Your spark isn't your purpose.
That last box fills in when you're ready to come live.
And, the thing is
you're pretty great at jazzing.
But, Joe,
this means you won't get to...
It's okay. I already did.
Now it's your turn.
I'll go with you.
You know you can't do that.
I know. But I'll go as far as I can.
Hey! Take a look!
Wow!
Mr Gardner?
Yes?
Do you have a moment?
I think I'm speaking for all the Jerrys when I say thank you.
For what?
We're in the business of inspiration, Joe,
but it's not often we find ourselves inspired.
Huh. Really?
So, we all decided to give you another chance.
Hopefully, you will watch where you walk from now on.
But what about Terry?
We worked it out with Terry.
Mm. That's weird.
Hey, Terry, what's that over there?
Look immediately.
What? What are you talking about?
- Oh, nothing. You were saying? - Hmm?
Were you even talking? I can't remember.
Never mind.
Well?
Thanks.
So what do you think you'll do?
How are you gonna spend your life?
I'm not sure.
But I do know...
I'm going to live every minute of it.
Hey! Movie's over.
Go home!
Previously on "The 100"...
This land is ours now.
Resist, and you will be greeted by death.
The only thing that matters now is killing Pike.
- Echo? - Bellamy.
- You know her? - Yeah. She's Ice Nation.
She was in the cage next to mine.
Where the hell is Echo?
Ai haiplana.
Alie. controls people one person at a time
until there is no one left.
What we're doing is too important.
We need to increase the population
in the City of Light.
No!
We will not be done until everyone is with us.
I know how to stop Alie.
I see it. It's a kill switch.
Come on, Clarke.
The nuclear power plants that were destroyed by the bombs
have begun to melt down.
The Earth's surface will be uninhabitable,
so, you see, the City of Light
is the only thing that can save you.
Would you really condemn the human race to die
in 6 months?
I'll figure something out. We always do.
John?
Hey, hey, it's ok.
Clarke, you're not acting like someone
who just saved the world.
Because we didn't.
Indra?
Indra. Indra.
Indra.
- Alie.? - Gone. It's over.
And Pike?
I waited until it was done.
Mm.
Oh... no.
She'll be ok.
Octavia can take care of herself.
That's not what I'm worried about.
She won't be charged.
Everyone will say that Pike had it coming.
Maybe we all do.
How do we tell these people that the world
is ending after everything they've been through?
We don't, not until we know Alie.
was telling you the truth.
It was the truth.
Still, keep it to ourselves
until we know what we're dealing with
and how to stop it.
Damn.
You're afraid of how people will react.
Yes. Besides, I could use a break
from keeping you alive.
You gave them back their pain, Clarke.
Let's not add to it by telling them
they're gonna die in 6 months.
Good.
Once everyone's down, we go home, we get to work.
We didn't survive this long just to let
a little radiation takes us out.
Thank you for keeping me alive.
You don't make it easy.
He didn't fall.
He chased me in the City of Light.
Lexa killed him.
Wanheda.
Sorry about the... you know.
Smashing my face into a wall or pistol-whipping me?
Can I plead the chip?
When you save the world, you're supposed to celebrate.
I think it's a rule.
I'll celebrate when we know the others are ok
and when I get the mainframe back online.
Is it weird I want to go back in?
It's not weird, Jasper.
It is weird that you can code
when you're not a coder, though, right?
It's like Alie. upgraded your brain.
You ok?
Are you?
You've been through more than anyone.
There's nothing like a little pain
to remind you you're alive.
Wish I got an upgrade.
Ok. Everyone out. Go on.
Take the music with you.
I need quiet to fix the radio.
Raven, we won.
I'm sure everyone's fine in Polis.
I hope so, but until I'm certain...
Do you need help with the radio?
No. I got this.
You sure?
Rule one of engineering... no drinking on the job.
Go on. Celebrate. Please enjoy yourselves.
I'm starving. Help me raid the kitchen.
Uh...
Oh...
Bellamy, are you there?
Polis, this is Arkadia. Come in, Polis.
Come on. Where are you?
What have I done?
What have we done?
I told you to stay upstairs with the rest of the wounded.
Do you need another shot?
Do Miller and Jackson have everything
they need up there?
Yeah.
They blame us for the chip.
It's not safe for us here anymore.
Wanheda.
Wanheda.
Clarke.
Good. You're down. We have to go.
The rover's in the north woods.
What about the wounded?
Grounders don't want our help.
Our people we'll treat at Arkadia.
Hello?
Bellamy, please, come in.
Raven, you ok?
Yeah. Yeah. We're all in one piece.
That's good.
There's something we need you to look into.
First, tell me how my friends are.
Did everyone make it? Clarke?
I'm here, thanks to you.
Oh...
Raven, did Alie. ever tell you
why she created the City of Light?
No. Why?
- Clarke? - Fill Raven in.
- All right. Raven... - They need a doctor.
Roan?
He got shot trying to help me. I thought he was dead.
Not yet, but he's close.
No exit wound.
We need to get the bullet out quickly.
Get away from our king.
Wait. Please, no.
You're making a mistake. We're part of the coalition.
I could save him, but you have to let me.
We have our own healer.
Echo...
Hey, Bellamy, don't.
- Man, stop. - Let her go, Echo. Let her go.
Back off, Bellamy.
Your king is my friend. Let us help him.
I saw you in the City of Light.
I know you destroyed it. Thank you for that.
Look around you.
Skaikru did this to us.
Because of them, Ontari, your rightful commander,
is dead.
This imposter stole her Flame.
No. Wanheda saved us,
all of us... Grounder and Skaikru.
There would have been nothing to save us from
if not for you.
Azgeda has no authority here.
We do now.
In the name of King Roan, as rightful caretakers
of the throne of the Commanders,
Polis is now under Azgeda rule.
Like hell it is.
Where's your war chief, girl?
Our war chief is dead, Ambassador.
As a member of the queen's guard,
command of the army has fallen to me
until the king awakens.
If he awakens.
Until a new Commander can ascend,
Polis is to be ruled by ambassadors of the coalition.
If Azgeda wants it, they must take it by force.
Consider it taken. No Skaikru leaves this city.
Looks like saving the world will have to wait.
That's it.
Let me help you, please.
It's good to see you're making friends.
Hello, John.
Glad to see you made it down.
I could use some help with the dead.
Go float yourself.
These dead are on you, too, Chancellor.
Hey, what are you doing?
Stocking up. What's it look like.
Stocking up for what, exactly?
It's not safe for my kind here.
Are forbidden.
I have to leave this place, John.
So, what, you're gonna bail on me again?
I didn't bail on you.
I came back,
took the damn chip because Jaha said
he would take me to you.
Hey...
come with me to Arkadia.
I'm serious, Emori, ok?
We can be together there. My people will protect you.
Are you sure about that?
How many times have they cast you out?
It's different now. They owe me, ok? Please.
Come on.
- Ok. - Ok?
Ok.
We can still pick up a few things first, right?
Sir, that's everyone we could find.
Stationed 10 guards at the temple door.
Are you sure you don't want me to stay?
You lead them home, Major.
We'll be there as soon as we can.
- Marcus... - I'm ok.
We focus on what comes next.
- Well? - You're not gonna like it.
When you destroyed the City of Light,
there were a thousand Azgeda warriors
inside the city of Polis.
Good timing.
Only way to remove them is by force.
- Then let's remove them. - Slow down.
You're talking about a war.
Yes. Rockline, Flokru, and Broadleaf
will join Trikru without question,
but we'll still be short.
This is madness.
We should be leaving with the others
while we still have time.
They know where we live. If we run, they'll follow.
There are 8 other clans. How do we get them to join us?
I can do it, but I'll need the Flame.
No.
Clarke, the clans
- will follow whoever has the Flame. - Azgeda won't.
Then we fight.
- That's the point. - No, it's not.
The point is, there's no time for a fight.
We have to save Roan.
Save him? They won't let us near him.
Wait a second. What don't we know?
The reason Alie. created the City of Light.
Why?
Nuclear reactors inside power plants
that survived the bombs are melting down.
Radiation levels are already rising.
If we can't figure out a way to fix it,
all of us will be dead in 6 months.
- Alie. told you this? - Yes.
- And you believe her? - Raven's looking into it.
I believe her.
Even if it's true, that's 6 months away.
There are a thousand Ice Nation warriors
on the street who want to kill us today.
They won't kill us.
How could you possibly know that?
Because we're gonna surrender.
Ontari belongs with her people.
Tell them I only talk to Bellamy.
It worked. She's in.
Your king's on the table.
Well, go save him.
She won't talk to you.
I don't like this, John.
Bellamy's right there. Just wait here.
She's Ice Nation. She can't be trusted.
Never a dull moment, huh?
Bellamy, pay attention.
She's part of the royal guard, spies.
That's why she's not marked,
very dangerous, very loyal.
Not to the people who saved her life.
Bellamy, I know how you feel about her,
but you can't lose control.
You offer them technology, guns,
whatever it takes to keep her talking.
Is that clear?
I didn't agree to give them guns.
Well, that's probably because you're not an idiot.
It won't get that far.
Our objective is to buy time
for Abby to save the king,
and if you want to help, grab a weapon,
stand a post.
Take mine.
I got this.
I'm sorry, Bellamy.
What is it?
Do you know what I said about being safe with my people?
Your plan was better. Let's go.
Before you say anything, remember,
I saved your life by taking you
out of Mount Weather.
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you to bring the girl,
but I was following orders, Bellamy.
I wish it was that easy.
Today, you guys.
I need more time.
I know how it feels to lose someone
you care about to war,
but we do what we do for our people.
You slaughter us, we slaughter you.
That all went away in the City of Light,
but it's back now,
so here we are.
The bullet is pressing against his carotid.
It's cutting off blood flow to his brain.
As soon as I get it out, he should wake up.
What are the terms of your surrender?
We recognize Ice Nation rule,
and you honor Lexa's coalition,
including the 13th clan.
No.
Come on. Come on. Almost there.
We'll give you guns
and show you how to use them.
- Got it. - Oh, good job.
- What now? - Now we wait.
Trikru accepts this?
They're not happy about it.
Not much they can do now, though, is there,
without an army.
You were there.
Then you know why everyone hates Skaikru
and why we can never accept your terms.
The alternative is war. Is that what you want?
No one wants war.
Lay down your guns, and we'll let your children live.
His breathing is still too shallow.
You said his lungs were fine.
No. I said I thought so.
It's possible a bone fragment
could've lodged in the tissue.
I'll give you time to decide.
Hey...
I wasn't done talking.
You are now.
Screw this.
- Come on. - It's time to go.
No. He needs more time.
If Roan doesn't wake up, we're all dead.
Guns on the ground, or he dies.
We disarm, we're done.
Abby'll come through.
Do what she says.
Guns on the ground now.
- They're here. - Back door.
I have to close, or he'll bleed out.
No. We have to go, or we'll bleed out.
- This is gonna have to do. - Good job.
Go.
No. We were trying to save him.
Oh...
Roan, help us.
Tell them we're friends.
You shouldn't try to stand so soon.
Where is Ontari?
Dead, Sire, killed by them.
We couldn't save her,
but we did what we came here to do.
Now I need you to honor your promise
to protect my people.
Yeah. That was before your people shot me
and killed my Commander.
We just saved your damn life.
Roan, your people are hungry
for you to lead them.
Do so now as your mother would have.
Kill Wanheda.
Take her power and rule over everything.
- That was something. - I know.
Hey, look.
Um, now that everybody's coming back, I just...
I don't want you to think
that I expect anything.
Uh, what if I do?
Well, yeah. That's be good, too.
- Yeah? - Yeah.
Ok.
Sorry.
Knocking's not your thing, is it?
Get dressed and meet me in Engineering.
Why? What's wrong?
We're all gonna die.
Oh, I'll get Jasper.
Jasper.
One second.
What were you doing?
Uh, no... nothing. Sleeping.
Raven needs us in Engineering.
Let's go.
After the second Fukushima disaster,
Panacea Power patented a failsafe system
with multiple redundancies.
By 2048, two dozen mega reactors
were built to withstand any disaster,
even a nuclear attack.
But that's good, right?
There's always a catch.
The plants were built to be
self-sustaining for a hundred years.
So the warrantee just ran out.
This is us.
Yes.
It's been yellow since we've landed.
Yellow we can handle...
our bodies adapted in space...
but it's rising when it should be falling,
and when it hits red...
We're dead.
Uh, how long?
At the current rate of increase,
6 months,
but it'll be bad way before that.
Can we stop it?
No.
Oh... oh, man.
I'm gonna watch the sunrise.
Wanheda and her friends are locked up.
The rest of Skaikru appears to have fled,
but we're ready to ride them down on your command.
Not yet.
Forgive me for saying so,
but we can't afford for our people
to think you're weak.
Call me weak again.
I meant no offense.
Yeah, you did.
Say your piece.
You haven't been home in more than 3 years.
You act as if that was my choice.
Of course it wasn't.
You were a bargaining chip.
It almost broke your mother to send you away.
Killing Lexa in soulou gonplei
was to be your triumphant return,
but you lost.
Our war chiefs don't respect you.
Then I'll get new war chiefs.
The army is loyal to them, not you.
And who are you loyal to...
Spy?
I'm loyal to my clan,
to my king.
Let me serve you.
I can help you do what your mother never could,
what Ontari never could.
- Rule everything. - Yes.
Trikru is weak and ready to fall,
and Skaikru is more hated than ever.
Give the order to take them both out,
and our war chiefs will follow you.
Show them Wanheda's head while you do it,
and they will worship you.
Bring honor to your grandfather's crown.
I know that look.
I loved her, Mom.
I know.
Wanheda, on your feet.
Where's the king?
Hey, I need to see Roan.
Hey. Hey!
- No! - Hey!
- Wait! No! No! - Wait! Echo! Echo!
- Wait! - Echo, listen to me.
- Where are you taking her. - Echo!
Echo!
No.
- Sire... - Get out.
It's always something with you,
isn't it?
Roan, we need your help.
Well, this should be good.
Something's coming,
something unlike anything we've seen before.
What's coming?
You know the fire that ended the world.
Lexa called it Praimfaya.
It'll be like that, a wave of radiation
that'll kill everything in its path.
Our ancestors survived Praimfaya,
and so will we.
No, you won't, not this time,
not without us.
Look.
I don't know if we can stop it,
but if we can't, all of us will be dead
in 6 months.
Science is our only hope.
Please, honor Lexa's coalition.
Recognize Skaikru as the 13th clan
so we can go home and come up with a way
for us to survive, all of us.
Listen to that.
I let you live, I'll be dead in 6 days,
not 6 months.
Sorry. Can't.
Jus drein jus daun!
Jus drein jus daun!
Jus drein jus daun!
Jus drein jus daun!
Jus drein jus daun!
Jus drein jus daun!
Jus drein...
I'll give you this.
We were told it was lost.
You give me one good reason why I shouldn't
just take that and cut your head off.
I just gave you one, and you know
I wouldn't be offering this
unless what I was saying were true.
Take it.
The clans will follow you. That's what you want.
I want what's best for my people,
same as you.
Then help me save them.
Roan, listen to me.
You wanted an Ice Nation Commander.
With this, you control who ascends.
There will never be a Commander to rule
over Azgeda unless you allow it.
I know you've all come here for an execution,
but no one else will die here today.
The City of Light has fallen...
And there is no Commander left to rule us.
Until another Nightblood ascends,
I... King Roan of Azgeda,
eldest son of Nia,
grandson of Theo...
am caretaker of the throne
and keeper of the Flame.
Until another ascends, Azgeda honors and will defend
the coalition of the last true Commander...
Lexa kom Trikru, including the 13th clan.
Let it be known that an attack against Skaikru
is an attack against us all.
From your king.
With this, you'll be safe
in any of our lands.
You think we'll ever be able
to trust each other again?
I doubt it.
Welcome back to the coalition.
Time to go.
We'll do our best
to keep the king on his throne.
We'll find a way to beat the radiation.
If either of you screw this up, we die.
No pressure.
This is serious, O.
If anyone finds out why Roan helped us,
it'll be every clan for itself.
The king will fall, and they'll come after us.
It's getting dark. Let's do this.
- May we meet again. - May we meet again.
You turn the page.
You turn the page, and you don't look back.
You do better today than you did yesterday.
You understand?
Before you know it,
you'll deserve to survive.
I hope so.
The youth that inherited the earth.
And they have 6 months to save it.
Ok, Princess. What now?
Now we survive.
Hey.
Previously on "The 100"...
In the name of King Roan,
Polis is now under Azgeda rule.
The reason A.L.I.E. created the City of Light,
nuclear reactors inside power plants
that survived the bombs are melting down.
If we can't figure out a way to fix it,
all of us will be dead in 6 months.
There are a thousand Ice Nation warriors
on the street who want to kill us today.
They won't kill us.
How could you possibly know that?
Roan, we need your help. Something's coming.
Our ancestors survived Praimfaya.
Not this time, not without us.
I, king Roan of Azgeda, let it be known
that an attack against Skaikru is an attack against us all.
We'll do our best to keep the king on his throne.
We'll find a way to beat the radiation.
If either of you screw this up, we die.
Ok, Princess. What now?
Now we survive.
No.
No.
No!
Do it. She'll break.
No!
No.
Put the knife to your own throat.
No. Ohh...
Clarke, don't.
No.
You are a terrible influence.
Roan is expecting me.
Abby...
Jake's a part of who you are.
Go. The king needs you...
but be careful.
The tower's safe enough,
but we're on dangerous ground here.
Welcome to your throne room, my King.
Now that the lift has been repaired,
I've doubled the guard on the doors at every floor.
Expecting trouble?
I trust only Azgeda.
Your mother taught me that. Our people loved her for it.
Our people feared her, Echo.
Because she was fierce and vicious.
My mother's ambition, her disregard
for Lexa's alliance got her killed.
If I may, why do you insist on ruling as Lexa did
when it's not what's best for our people?
At least tell me there's a reason.
Forgive the intrusion, Your Highness.
May we have a word...
privately?
You can wait like the other ambassadors.
Echo, leave us...
please.
We were right to be concerned about Trishanakru.
Rafel is gonna challenge you for control.
Bold move for a new ambassador.
So? Let him come.
With respect, you're still recovering.
The law says you could pick someone
to fight in your place.
No. The clans will never accept
a leader who hides behind the law
or another warrior's blood.
You'll lose.
Lexa kicked your ass without a bullet hole in your chest.
We should cancel the gathering
or delay until you're strong enough.
No. Letting the ambassadors
have a voice keeps the peace here.
Azgeda holds this city through force alone,
and the Flame won't keep the clans at bay forever.
If they unite against us,
we could lose, and if we lose...
They come for Skaikru.
And the radiation comes for us all.
No one has to die.
The point of our arrangement
is to give us time to find a solution to save everyone.
And how is that solution coming?
We're working on it.
In the meantime, I'm here to keep you in power.
Let me talk to the ambassador.
Go ahead. Talk...
but...
if you fail,
I'll have no choice but to fight.
We've been at this for two days.
There must be something we're not thinking of.
What if we could reach
the nearest nuclear reactor?
I told you, the meltdown started months ago.
There's no magic button to turn them off.
Today this isn't black rain, but it will be soon.
That's why we have to focus on riding out the radiation,
finding someplace safe and big enough
to hold all 500 of us.
This isn't just about saving us.
I made a promise to Roan. It's about saving everyone.
And that's why we need to tell everyone.
Crowdsource it.
If there's another Mount Weather out there,
the Grounders will know about it.
And you think they're just gonna tell us
just like that?
If we tell everybody they're gonna die,
the coalition is over, Roan falls,
and the Grounders will be at our gate.
Then just tell our people.
We need more minds on this problem.
On the Ark, people volunteered
for the culling because they were told the truth
and given a choice...
A choice your dad died for.
You think I've forgotten that?
Ok. We'll tell everybody the truth
as soon as we have a viable solution.
Without one, it'll start a panic.
- You don't know that. - That's it.
What are you talking about?
Think.
Alpha Station survived for 97 years in space
through elevated radiation levels
and extreme temperature fluctuations.
Sound familiar?
All we have to do is patch up the ship.
We're standing in our viable solution.
Raven says we can get it sealed up in a month.
- The Ark is our ark. - I get it.
Ok, so freeze-dried meat until we can grow our own food.
We got oxygen scrubbers, but hot do we store
enough water for 500 people?
We don't.
That's why we're heading to Farm Station.
Why the hell would we do that?
It's in the damn Ice Nation.
You just said it.
We need a hydro-generator,
and Farm Station has one for the crops.
Think you can get us there?
No way. Find another machine.
Look. There are no others, and without it,
we won't last a year inside this ship,
let alone 5.
Fine. I'm in. Bryan stays here.
His leg's still healing.
I'm in, too.
Good. We roll in an hour.
You don't have to do this.
Actually, yeah, I do.
Since Octavia murdered Pike,
I'm the only one left who knows where it is.
Why are you defending him? Pike was a dictator.
He was an elected chancellor,
and if you don't care about that,
he kept me alive for 3 months.
Then why did you help us turn him over to the Grounders?
To save you, Nate.
Sorry.

You know you're wasting our drinking water, right?
You know we're all gonna die in 6 months, right?
Not if we find what we're looking for today.
Oh, please.
Tell me about another pointless task
Clarke has roped you into
or, better yet, don't.
I don't want to keep any more of her secrets.
We're going back to Farm Station.
Why don't you come with us?
Monty...
Look at me.
I'm really trying not to.
I'm fine, all right? I'm having fun.
Jasper...
I'm not gonna kill myself...
what's the point? But you know what?
If you want to cheer me up,
while you're at Farm Station,
get that weed we stashed
behind the wall of your old bedroom.
Huh?
Don't leave me hanging, man. Just...
yes.
Music to my ears.
Hey, you want a hug?
Hey, uh,
blueprint for the hydro-generator,
and don't forget, it's filled with hydrazine
that combines with oxygen to make water,
so go slow.
Or the hydrazine could go boom.
I know. Raven, I got this.
Don't you have a ship to fix?
Battery's full.
If we're lucky,
we won't have to stop to recharge.
Even luckier if Roan's seal will work
the way it's supposed to.
If you get in trouble, just show this.
Got it. Thanks.
Load up.
You can still come with us.
No. I can't.
Arkadia is just Plan "B." It doesn't help the Grounders.
I'm not stopping until we have a solution
that saves everyone.
We save who we can save today.
All right. Let's go.
This is as close as we can get.
From here, we go on foot.
We get the machine and get out of here.
I don't want to stay here any longer than we have to.
Guys, got a problem.
The barn isn't empty.
They moved in.
If it's the same guys who attacked us,
with our guns, we could take them.
I'm sure we could,
but we didn't come here to fight.
They butchered us, killed kids,
our friends, our families.
I don't like it any more than you do,
but Bellamy's right.
We need that machine.
Uh, guys?
Weapons down. Now.
Now!
Bryan, now.
Ok. It's just...
Where did you get this?
King Roan.
Skaikru and Azgeda are allies.
He sent us to get
a part of the ship, a machine.
Look.
If we'd come to take this place back,
there'd be a lot more of us, and you know that.
Where is this machine for the king?
We've got a lot of work to do
to get the ship ready for winter.
Sector 4... the crack in the outer wall,
we need to patch it up.
Start by repairing the damaged panels.
Sector 5... we need to get that tree
out of the hole and seal it up.
Any questions?
Ok. Go.
You ok?
There is so much to do, and I get a total
of 5 volunteers to help me fix the ship?
That's a start.
I can't run this repair alone, Clarke,
even if I had complete mobility,
even if Sinclair was still alive.
Who... who the hell am I giving them orders?
I'm... I'm not the Chief.
I'm not the Chancellor,
but here we are.
For what it's worth, there's nobody
I trust more to do this than you.
As soon as Bellamy gets back with that machine,
we go public with everything
and get you the help that you need.
Am I interrupting?
What do you want?
I was an engineer before I was chancellor.
I supervised the redesign of Sector 5.
And how many people died from Sector 5
in the culling when you sucked
the air out of their lungs?
42.
Would you like to know their names?
Raven, wait.
We could use the help.
You do know he made me cut my wrist
to force your mom to take the chip, right?
He was chipped, too.
He searched for the City of Light.
He bought A.L.I.E. here.
He showed her how to overcome free will.
Yes. Those are my sins...
And I have to live with them.
Raven...
You want to help?
Go sort the scrap.
Whatever you need.
Ever meet a Grounder who could power up a spaceship?
Do what you came to do.
No.
Up there, the generator.
Let's go.
Riley? Riley...
Bryan, wait.
We thought you were dead.
Only the machine. The rest is ours.
Come on.
Let me take a look.
You're healing, but you need more time.
I don't have time.
I would be honored to take your place in this fight.
I will not run from this challenge.
Echo's right.
I didn't save your life so that you
could tear yourself apart again.
Since when are you two on the same side?
And if you can't help me,
why the hell are you still here?
This fight can still be avoided.
Protecting Skaikru gives the other clans
an excuse to challenge you.
Let me take care of the problem.
Let me do what your mother would have done.
Then please just tell me,
what did Wanheda offer?
What deal is worth losing
the faith of your people?
Chance to survive the end of the world.
That's what they're offering to all of us.
Soon, Praimfaya will once again destroy everything.
Skaikru's trying to stop it.
My King, they're lying to you.
They'd say anything to save themselves.
Let me prove it to you.
Send me to Arkadia.
Your only concern now should be helping me win.
Once I do, you may go to Arkadia,
prove my trust in Wanheda's deserved.
Ambassador,
may we speak privately?
We know you plan to challenge King Roan.
I'd like to ask you to reconsider.
Ask? After everything your people have done,
you expect diplomacy?
Skaikru's not your enemy.
Skaikru made me murder my entire family.
I have no one left.
I'm sorry for your loss,
but the chip, the technology,
it affected all of us, every clan.
You blame Skaikru for the City of Light.
Shouldn't you also credit us for destroying it?
After everything we've suffered,
why spill more blood?
The clans are stronger together.
Heh. You see, Ilian?
The king can't fight, or his minions
wouldn't be here trying to stop us.
If the king wasn't hurt,
do you think this coward would give a crap
about your family?
Since you landed here, your people have done
nothing but rip our world apart.
Rafel, I urge you...
You reap what you sow, Ambassador.
The time of Skaikru is over.
Well, that went well.
Oh, there's too many people.
Damn it!

Hey...
Can we talk?
Sure.
I got about 6 months, no waiting. What's up?
I'm trying to make sure that we have
more than 6 months, which is why
these people need to get back to work.
I didn't force them to stop.
I guess they think it's the end of the day,
not, you know, the end of days.
Don't you want us to survive, Jasper?
No. I don't want us to survive.
I want us to live.
If we don't repair that ship,
none of us will have that chance.
And what about free will?
That's why you destroyed A.L.I.E., right?
Why don't you tell them all the truth?
Keep your voice down.
Should let them decide what they want to do
with their last 6 months.
What are you so afraid of?
We can't just go to them with no solutions.
- People will panic. - Ah, I see. Hmm.
That's spoken like the council

♪ Ooh ooh ooh ♪
I don't care that we're unarmed.
We can't just leave them.
We're in the coalition now,
so we ask the king to free them.
That's our best bet.
Not if it means leaving Riley.
No. We won't, ok, but Harper's right.
We try diplomacy first.
If that doesn't work, we come back
with reinforcements for the slaves
after we take home the machine, right?
Yeah.
They're moving them.
Hey, it's now or never.
Are there any other exits in here?
No. This is completely sealed.
Came down from space in here
because it's the most secure room in the ship.
It's designed that way
in case the hydrazine blew.
What?
We have a bomb.
Wait a second.
The end of the world is coming, and you want to destroy
the one thing that'll keep our people alive?
Yeah. Not all of our people.
What about Riley?
I vote that we take it home.
No. Blow it up.
I'm with Bryan.
I know what it's like to be locked up and afraid.
You didn't leave us in Mount Weather.
We shouldn't leave them here.
Can we build another machine?
No way. The tech's too advanced.
We have 6 months. We have Raven.
Are you telling me she can't figure out
another way to make water?
Yes. Look.
I know you want to make up for the things you've done...
believe me, we all do...
but we need to think of the big picture...
25 people instead of 500.
We're talking about the human race, Bellamy.
We need to get this machine back to Arkadia.
It's the only way.
It's two to two, your call, Bellamy.
What's it gonna be?
- Watch it, Miller. - Wait. Wait. Wait.
Just set it down here.
Now!
- Bryan, come on! - Run! Move! Move!
Ok, Nate. This isn't your kill. This isn't your kill.
This is Monty's kill.
What are you talking about?
This is the man that murdered your father.
You don't have to do this.
Yeah. I do.
Get off!
Get off! Get off!
Raven? Raven, you here?
Polyethylene silicone elastomers.
We don't need that for a winter storm
or to protect us from a Grounder attack.
What are we really bracing Alpha Station for?
Heavy lies the crown.
I know the burden of keeping a secret
you think is going to destroy your people.
You locked me up.
You floated my father.
And now you understand why.
No leader starts out wanting to lie
or imprison or execute their people.
The decisions you face just whittle you down
piece by piece.
So what do I do?
I'll tell you what I told your mother
after the culling.
We make the best decisions that we can
with the information that we have,
then hope that there's a forgiving God.
Can Roan fight?
It's too soon.
One simple task, and I'm failing.
No. You'll figure it out.
Hmm.
What's wrong?
There's nothing more that I can do for Roan.
Ah.
You need to go back to Arkadia, to Clarke.
Your necklace.
What the hell do you want?
I'm here to ask you
one last time to back down.
Hmm, you trying to frighten me, little girl?
If your problem really is with Skaikru,
not Roan, then challenge me instead.
We can settle this.
You're not worth my blade.
I came here to change your mind.
Hmm. You can't.
Trishanakru will have its justice.
Now leave before I...
Long live the King.
Roan, please, it's not too late to cancel.
You failed. We do this Azgeda's way.
Take your seat, Ambassador.
Where is Rafel kom Trishanakru?
The ambassador was found dead this morning.
His heart stopped.
Let us begin.
You're gonna kill me, too?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I honor Lexa kom Trikru.
We are stronger together.
Hey, Bry...
we ok?
Just tell me you think
saving these people was worth it.
I wish I could.
- Hey... - I can't.
I can't. I'm sorry.
Bryan...
Riley?
Clarke.
Riley...
I can't believe you're alive.
I am now.
Get Riley and the others to medbay
and tell them we'll take them
to their villages in the morning.
Where is it?
We didn't get the machine.
It didn't survive landing?
No. It did, but I had a choice...
bring the machine home or use it to save them.
Oh, we are so screwed.
We have time, but I am not sacrificing
any more innocent lives.
You just did.
I made the call, and I'll live with that.
Yeah. You're not the only one
who has to live with your call,
as usual.
Well, go tell them.
Go tell Riley I should've left them to die.
Ok. How many of us will the ship sustain
without a hydro-generator?
No more than a hundred.
What am I supposed to tell the people now?
The truth.
Crowdsource it like we talked about.
Call for a general meeting.
What are you gonna do?
Hope that there's a forgiving God.
So now you know the truth.
I know you're afraid.
I know you're angry, but when I shut down A.L.I.E.,
I knew there was a way for us to get through this together.
Alpha Station is that way.
Every single one of us
will survive on this ship.
It won't be easy.
Raven needs volunteers if we're gonna get it ready in time.
It'll be a lot of work,
but now you understand why we need to do it.
If we stick together,
I give you my word,
we won't just survive.
We'll thrive.
Nice speech.
Sometimes hope is more important than truth.
Your dad would be so proud.
You wanted workers. You got them.
Everyone to the hangar bay. Now.
We save who we can save today.
So if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it2
and either slit is observed, it will not go through both slits.
If it's unobserved, it will.
However, if it's observed after it's left the plane
but before it hits its target, it won't have gone through both slits.
Agreed. What's your point?
There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt.
- Excuse me. - Hang on.
One across is "Aegean."
Eight down is "Nabokov."
26 across is "MCM."
14 down is... Move your finger...
"Phylum" which makes 14 across "Port-au-Prince"
See, "Papa Doc's capitol idea," that's "Port-au-Prince."
Haiti.
- Can I help you? - Yes.
Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?
If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
I think this is the place.
- Fill these out. - Thank you.
- We'll be right back. - Take your time.
I'll just finish my crossword puzzle.
Oh, wait.
Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
What, are you kidding? You're a semi-pro.
No. We are committing genetic fraud.
There's no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high-IQ offspring.
Think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix
who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
Sheldon, this was your idea.
A little extra money to get fractional T-1 bandwidth in the apartment.
I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads.
But there's some poor woman who's gonna pin her hopes on my sperm.
What if she winds up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should use
an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve?
- I'm sure she'll still love him. - I wouldn't.
Well, what do you want to do?
I want to leave.
What's the protocol for leaving?
I don't know... I've never reneged on a proffer of sperm before.
Let's try just walking out.
- Bye. - Bye. Nice meeting you.
Are you still mad about the sperm bank?
You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Not really.
If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimeters,
- most people will trip. - I don't care.
Two milli... That doesn't seem right.
No, it's true, I did a series of experiments when I was 12.
My father broke his clavicle.
Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
No. That was a result of my work with lasers.
New neighbor?
Evidently.
Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
200-pound transvestite with a skin condition?
Yes, she is.
- Oh, hi. - Hi.
We don't mean to interrupt. We live across the hall.
Oh, that's nice.
We don't live together. I mean...
We live together,
but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms.
Okay, well...
Guess I'm your new neighbor. Penny.
- Leonard. Sheldon. - Hi.
Well...
Welcome to the building.
Thank you. Maybe we can have coffee sometime.
Great.
- Well... bye. - Bye.
Should we have invited her for lunch?
We're gonna start season two of Battlestar Galactica.
We already watched the season two DVDs.
Not with commentary.
I think we should be good neighbors
and invite her over, make her feel welcome.
We never invited Louie-slash-Louise over.
And that was wrong of us.
We need to widen our circle.
I have a very wide circle.
I have 212 friends on MySpace.
Yes, and you've never met one of them.
That's the beauty of it.
I'm gonna invite her over.
We'll have a nice meal and... chat.
Chat? We don't chat. At least not offline.
It's not difficult.
You just listen to what she says
and then you say something appropriate in response.
To what end?
Hi... again.
Hi.
Anyway...
We brought home Indian food.
And...
I know that moving can be stressful,
and I find that when I'm undergoing stress,
that good food and company can have a comforting effect.
Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don't have to tell you
that, you know, a clean colon is just...
one less thing to worry about.
I'm no expert, but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation,
you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements.
You're inviting me over to eat?
Oh, that's so nice. I'd love to.
Great.
So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Today we tried masturbating for money.
Episode 1: Pilot Version 1.01
Transcript: swsub.com Sync by Jesslataree
Okay, make yourself at home.
Thank you.
You're very welcome.
This looks like some serious stuff.
- Leonard, did you do this? - Actually, that's my work.
Yeah. Well, it's just some quantum mechanics
with a little string theory doodling around the edges.
That part there, that's just a joke.
It's a spoof of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.
So you're like one of those Beautiful Mind genius guys.
- This is really impressive. - I have a board.
If you like boards, this is my board.
Holy smokes.
If by "holy smokes", you mean
a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff
you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT, sure.
- What? - Come on.
Who hasn't seen this differential below "Here I sit, broken-hearted"?
At least I didn't have to invent 26 dimensions
just to make the math come out.
I didn't invent them. They're there.
- In what universe? - In all of them... that is the point.
Do you guys mind if I start?
Penny...
that's where l sit.
So, sit next to me.
No... I sit there.
What's the difference?
- What's the difference? - Here we go.
In the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator
to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration
In the summer, it's directly in the path of a cross-breeze
created by opening windows there and there.
It faces the television at an angle
that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation,
nor so far wide as to create a parallax distortion.
I could go on, but I think I've made my point.
Do you want me to move?
- Well... - Just sit somewhere else.
Fine.
Sheldon, sit!
Well, this is nice.
We don't have a lot of company over.
That's not true. Koothrappali and Wolowitz come over all the time.
- I know, but... - Tuesday night,
we played Klingon Boggle till 1:00 a.m.
Yeah, I remember.
- Don't say we don't have company. - Sorry.
- That has negative social implications. - I said I'm sorry!
So...
Klingon Boggle?
Yeah. It's like regular Boggle, but...
in Klingon.
That's probably enough about us. So, tell us about you.
Me? Okay.
I'm a Sagittarius,
which probably tells you way more than you need to know.
Yes. It tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion
that the sun's apparent position
relative to arbitrarily defined constellations at the time of your birth
somehow affects your personality.
Participate in the what?
I think what Sheldon's trying to say
is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been our first guess.
Yeah, a lot of people think I'm a water sign.
Okay, let's see, what else.
I'm a vegetarian. Except for fish.
And the occasional steak. I love steak!
Well, that's interesting.
Leonard can't process corn.
Well... do you have some sort of a job?
I'm a waitress at The Cheesecake Factory.
I love cheesecake.
You're lactose-intolerant.
I don't eat it... I just think it's a good idea.
Anyways, I'm also writing a screenplay.
It's about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln, Nebraska,
to be an actress and winds up a waitress at The Cheesecake Factory.
So, it's based on your life.
No, I'm from Omaha.
If that was movie, I would go see it.
I know, right?
Okay, let's see, what else...
Guess that's about it.
That's the story of Penny.
It sounds wonderful.
It was.
Until I fell in love with a jerk!
What's happening?
God, you know, 4 years I lived with him.
4 years... that's like as long as high school.
It took you 4 years to get through high school?
It just... I can't believe I trusted him.
Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.
You? No, you'll only make it worse.
You want to know the most pathetic part?
Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts...
I still love him.
Is that crazy?
No, it's not crazy. It's a...
It's a paradox.
Paradoxes are part of nature. Think about light.
If you look at Huygens, light is a wave,
as confirmed by the double-slit experiments,
but then along comes Albert Einstein
and discovers that light behaves like particles, too.
Well, I didn't make it worse.
I'm so sorry. I'm such a mess.
On top of everything else, I'm all gross from moving
and my stupid shower doesn't even work.
Our shower works.
Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?
- Yes. - No.
It's right down the hall.
Thanks.
You guys are really sweet.
Well, this is an interesting development.
How so?
It has been some time since we've had a woman
take her clothes off in our apartment.
That's not true. Remember at Thanksgiving,
my grandmother with Alzheimer's had that episode?
Point taken. It has been some time
since we've had a woman take her clothes off,
after which we didn't want to rip our eyes out.
The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
So what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?
Excuse me?
That woman is not going to have sex with you.
I'm not trying to have sex with her.
Good. Then you won't be disappointed.
What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me?
I'm a male and she's a female.
Yes, but not of the same species.
I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals here.
I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.
Of course.
That's not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop,
that I wouldn't participate.
However briefly.
Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered
when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?
It's Darth Vader shampoo.
Luke Skywalker's the conditioner.
- Wait till you see this. - It's fantastic, unbelievable.
See what?
It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
This isn't a good time.
It's before he became a creepy computer voice.
- That's great. You guys have to go. - Why?
It's just not a good time.
Leonard has a lady over.
Yeah, right... your grandmother back in town?
And she's not a lady. She's just a new neighbor.
Hang on, there really is a lady here?
And you want us out because you're anticipating coitus?
I'm not anticipating coitus.
So she's available for coitus?
Can we please just stop saying "coitus"?
Technically, that would be"coitus interruptus. "
Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower...?
Hi. Sorry. Hello.
Enchanté, mademoiselle.
Howard Wolowitz, Caltech department of applied physics.
You may be familiar with some of my work.
It's currently orbiting Jupiter's largest moon
taking high-resolution digital photographs.
Penny. I work at The Cheesecake Factory.
I'll show you the trick with the shower.
Bonne douche.
I'm sorry?
It's French for "good shower. "
It's a sentiment I can express in six languages.
Save it for your blog, Howard.
All right, there it goes. It sticks. I'm sorry.
- Okay, thanks. - You're welcome.
You're just gonna to step right... Okay, I'll...
- Hey, Leonard? - The hair products are Sheldon's.
Can I ask you a favor?
A favor?
Sure, you can ask me a favor. I would do you a favor for you.
It's okay if you say no.
I'll probably say yes.
It's just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you just met.
I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.
- Must we? - Event A...
A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower.
Event B... we drive halfway across town to retrieve a television set
from the aforementioned woman's ex-boyfriend.
Query... on what plane of existence
is there even a semi-rational link between these events?
She asked me to do her a favor, Sheldon.
Yes, well, that may be the proximal cause of our journey,
but we both know it only exists in contradistinction
to the higher level distal cause.
- Which is? - You think with your penis.
That's a biological impossibility. And you didn't have to come.
Right, I could have stayed behind and watch Wolowitz try to hit on Penny
in Russian, Arabic and Farsi.
Why can't she get her own TV?
Come on, you know how it is with breakups.
No, I don't... and neither do you.
I broke up with Joyce Kim.
You did not break up with Joyce Kim. She defected to North Korea.
To mend her broken heart.
This situation is much less complicated.
There's some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend
as to who gets custody of the TV.
She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.
- So we get to have a scene with him? - No, there's not going to be a scene.
There's two of us and one of him.
Leonard, the two of us can't even carry a TV.
So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the university?
I'm sorry, do you speak English?
He speaks English. He just can't speak to women.
Really? Why?
He's kind of a nerd.
Juice box?
I'll do the talking.
- Yeah? - Hi, I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.
- Hello. - What did I just--
- We're here to pick up Penny's TV. - Get lost.
Okay, thanks for you time.
We're not going to give up just like that.
Leonard, the TV's in the building.
We've been denied access to the building, ergo, we are done.
Excuse me. If I were to give up on the first little hitch,
I never would have identified the fingerprints of string theory
in the aftermath of the Big Bang.
My apologies. What's your plan?
It's just a privilege to watch your mind at work.
Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360.
We should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.
What do you think their combined IQ is?
Just grab the door!
This is it.
I'll do the talking.
Good thinking. I'll just be the muscle.
Yeah?
I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.
From the intercom.
How the hell did you get in the building?
We're scientists.
Tell him about our IQ.
- Leonard... - What?
- My mom bought me those pants. - I'm sorry.
You're going to have to call her.
Sheldon, I am so sorry I dragged you through this.
It's okay. It wasn't my first pantsing and it won't be my last.
And you were right about my motives.
I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny
that might have someday led to sex.
Well, you got me out of my pants.
Anyway, I've learned my lesson.
She's out of my league, I'm done with her.
Got my work, one day I'll win the Nobel Prize
and then I'll die alone.
Don't think like that. You're not going to die alone.
Thank you, Sheldon. You're a good friend.
And you're certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.
This is one of my favorite places to kick back after a quest.
They have a great house ale.
Cool tiger.
Yeah, I've had him since level ten.
His name is Buttons.
Anyway, if you had your own game character
we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.
That sounds interesting.
You'll think about it?
I don't think I'll be able to stop thinking about it.
Smooth.
We're home.
My God, what happened?
Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards
and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.
I'm so sorry. I really thought if you guys went instead of me
he wouldn't be such an ass.
No, it was a valid hypothesis.
That was a valid...? What is happening to you?
Really, thank you so much for going and trying, you're just...
You're so terrific. Really.
Why don't you put some clothes on,
I'll get my purse, and dinner is on me, okay?
- Really? Great. - Thank you.
You're not done with her, are you?
Are babies will be smart and beautiful.
Not to mention imaginary.
- Is Thai food okay with you, Penny? - Sure.
We can't have Thai food,
- we had Indian for lunch. - So?
- They're both curry-based cuisines. - So?
It would be gastronomically redundant.
I can see we're going to have to spell out everything for this girl.
Any ideas, Raj?
Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado.
I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.
That sounds like fun.
I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole,
but as far as the population of this car goes,
you're a veritable mack daddy.
Here we go. Pad thai, no peanuts.
But does it have peanut oil?
I'm not sure.
Everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up.
Since it's not bee season, you can have my epinephrine.
- Are there any chopsticks. - No need. This is Thai food.
Here we go.
Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the 19th Century.
Interestingly they don't put the fork in their mouth--
they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth.
Ask him for a napkin. I dare you.
I'll get it.
Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.
- Hey, Leonard. - Oh, hi, Penny.
- Am I interrupting? - No. You're not swelling, Howard.
Look at my fingers. They're like Vienna sausages.
- Sounds like you have company. - They're not going anywhere.
So, you're coming home from work. That's great. How was work?
You know, it's a Cheesecake Factory.
People order cheesecake and I bring it to them.
So you kind of act like a carbohydrate delivery system.
Yeah. Call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage.
I was wondering if you could help me out
- with something. - Yes.
Great. I'm having some furniture
delivered tomorrow and I may not be here, so...
Hello.
- I'm sorry? - Haven't you ever been told
how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?
No, I haven't.
Get used to it.
Yeah. I probably won't.
- Hey, Sheldon. - Hi.
Hey, Raj.
Still not talking to me, huh?
Don't take it personally, it's his pathology.
He can't talk to women.
It can't talk to atractive woman, or in your case,
a cheesecake- scented goddess.
So there's gonna be some furniture delivered?
If it gets here and I'm not here, could you sign
and have them put it in my apartment?
No problem.
Great. Here's my spare key. Thank you.
Penny, wait.
If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us
for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
A marathon? How many Superman movies are there?
You're kidding, right?
I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter
and Superman swooshes down and catches her. Which one was that?
One.
You realize that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.
Yes, I know, men can't fly.
No. Let's assume that they can.
Lois Lane is falling,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second.
Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel.
Miss Lane, who is now traveling
at approximately 120 miles an hour,
hits them and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.
Unless Superman matches her speed and decelerates.
In what space, sir? She's two feet above the ground.
Frankly, if he really loved her, he'd let her hit the pavement.
It'd be a more merciful death.
Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption
that Superman's flight is a feat of strength.
Are you listening to yourself? It is well established
that his flight is a feat of strength.
It is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings,
an ability he derives from exposure to Earth's yellow sun.
And how does he fly at night?
A combination of the moon's solar reflection
and the energy-storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.
I'm just gonna go wash up.
I have 2,600 comic books in there. I challenge you
to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.
Challenge accepted.
We're locked out.
Also, the pretty girl left.
o/~ Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state o/~
o/~ Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! o/~
o/~ The Earth began to cool o/~
o/~ The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools o/~
o/~ We built the Wall o/~ o/~ We built the pyramid so/~
o/~ Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery o/~
o/~ That all started with a big bang o/~
Her apartment's on the fourth floor but the elevator's broken, so...
You're just gonna be done? Okay. Cool. Thanks
We'll just bring it up ourselves.
I hardly think so.
Why not?
Well, we don't have a dolly,
or lifting belts or any measurable upper-body strength.
We don't need strength-- we're physicists.
We are the intellectual descendants of Archimedes.
Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth.
It's just a matter of... I don't have this.
Archimedes would be so proud.
Do you have any ideas?
Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring.
Easy... easy.
Now we've got an inclined plane. The force required to lift
is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs,
call it 30 degrees, so, about half.
Exactly half.
Exactly half.
Let's push.
See, it's moving, this is easy.
It's all in the math.
- What's your formula for the corner? - What?
Okay, no problem.
Just come up here, help me pull and turn.
Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch.
You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds
of you having sexual congress with this woman.
Men do things for women without expecting sex.
Those would be men who just had sex.
I'm doing this to be a good neighbor.
In any case, there's no way it could lower the odds.
Almost there.
Almost there.
- Almost there. - No, we're not.
- I'm sorry. - No, we're not!
Watch your fingers.
Oh, God, my fingers!
- You okay? - No, her...
Great Caesar's ghost, look at this place.
So Penny's a little messy.
A little messy?
The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy.
This is chaos.
Excuse me.
Explain to me an organizational system
where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid.
I'm just inferring this is a couch
because the evidence suggests the coffee table
is having a tiny garage sale.
Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has
the compulsive need to sort, organize and label
the entire world around them?
No.
Well, they don't.
Hard as it may be for you to believe,
most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fiber content.
Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
- Come on, we should go. - Hang on.
- What are you doing? - I'm straightening up.
This is not your home.
This is not anyone's home. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.
When the transvestite lived here, you didn't care how he kept the place.
Because it was immaculate.
I mean, you opened that man's closet,
it was left to right evening gowns,
cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms.
What were you doing in his closet?
I helped him run some cable for a web cam.
This just arrived, we just brought this up... just now.
Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?
- No. - "No"?
No.
No.
Well, we'll get out of your hair.
Okay, great. Thank you again.
I just want you to know that you don't have to live like this.
I'm here for you.
What's he talking about?
- It's a joke. - I don't get it.
Yeah, he didn't tell it right.
Penny's sleeping.
Are you insane?
You can't just break into a woman's apartment
in the middle of the night and clean.
I had no choice. I couldn't sleep knowing
that just outside my bedroom was our living room,
and just outside our living room was that hallway,
and immediately adjacent to the hallway was... this.
Do you realize that if Penny wakes up,
there is no reasonable explanation as to why we're here.
I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
No, no, you gave me an explanation.
Its reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.
Don't be ridiculous. I have no peers.
We have to get out of here.
You might want to speak in a lower register.
What?
Evolution has made women sensitive
to high-pitched noises while they sleep
so that they'll be roused by a crying baby.
If you want to avoid waking her,
speak in a lower register.
That's ridiculous!
No.
"That's ridiculous."
Fine.
I accept your premise. Now, please, let's go.
I'm not leaving until I'm done.
If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.
Oh, what the hell.
Morning.
Morning.
I have to say I slept splendidly.
Granted, not long, but just deeply and well.
I'm not surprised.
A well-known folk cure for insomnia
is to break in your neighbor's apartment and clean.
Sarcasm?
You think?
Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox,
but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement
- to Penny's quality of life - You've convinced me.
Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet.
- You don't think that crosses a line? - Yes.
For God's sake,
do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth?
You have a sarcasm sign?
No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.
Do you want some cereal? I feel so good today,
I'm gonna choose from the low-fiber end of the shelf.
Hello, Honey Puffs.
Son of a bitch!
Penny's up.
You sick geeky bastards!
How did she know it was us?
I may have left a suggested organizational schematic
for her bedroom closet.
God, this is gonna be bad.
Good-bye, Honey Puffs. Hello, Big Bran.
You came into my apartment last night while I was sleeping?!
Yes, but only to clean.
Really more to organize. You're not actually dirty, per se.
Give me back my key.
I'm very, very sorry.
Do you understand how creepy this is?
Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night.
In my apartment, while I was sleeping?!
And snoring. And that's probably just a sinus infection.
But it could be sleep apnea.
You might want to see an otolaryngologist.
A throat doctor.
And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
Depending on the depth,
that's either a... proctologist
or a general surgeon.
I think what you're feeling
is perfectly valid and maybe a little bit later
when you're feeling a little less... for lack of a better word-- violated,
maybe we can talk about this some more.
- Stay away from me. - Sure, that's another way to go.
Penny, Penny!
Just to clarify,
because there will be a discussion when you leave,
is your objection solely to our presence
in the apartment while you were sleeping,
or do you also object to the imposition of a new organizational paradigm.
Well, that was a little non-responsive.
You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologize.
What's funny?
That wasn't sarcasm?
Boy, you are all over the place this morning.
I have a master's and two Ph.D.s, I should not have to do this.
What?!
I am truly sorry for what happened last night.
I take full responsibility.
And I hope that it won't color your opinion of Leonard,
who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear,
a gentle and thorough lover.
I did what I could.
Hey, Raj.
Hey, listen.
I don't know if you heard about what happened last night.
but I'm really upset about it.
I mean, they just... they let themselves into my place
and then they cleaned it. Can you even believe that?
How weird is that?
She's standing very close to me.
Oh, my, she does smell good.
What is that, vanilla?
if someone comes into your house at night, you shoot. Okay?
And you don't shoot to wound.
I mean, all right, my sister shot her husband,
but it was an accident, they were drunk.
Wait, what was I saying?
She's so chatty.
Maybe my parents are right.
Maybe I'd be better off with an Indian girl.
We'd have the same cultural background
and my wife could sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me.
It's obvious that they meant well, but...
I'm having a really rough time. I broke up with my boyfriend
and...
Just because most of the men I've known in my life happen to be jerks,
doesn't mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are.
Right?
She asked me a question. I should probably nod.
That's exactly what I thought.
Thank you for listening. You're a doll.
Turn your pelvis.
Grab a napkin, homie. You just got served.
It's fine.You win.
What's his problem?
His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Been there.
Sorry I'm late,
but I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny.
Really? You, Rajesh Koothrappali, spoke to Penny?
Actually, I was less the chatter than the chat-ee.
What did she say? Is she still mad at me?
Well, she was upset at first,
but probably because her sister shot somebody.
But then there was something about you,
and then she hugged me.
She hugged you? How'd she hug you?
Is that her perfume I smell?
Intoxicating, isn't it?
Hi.
What's going on?
Here's the thing.
"Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions
"to the first atomic bomb,
"so too I regret my participation in what was,
"at the very least, an error in judgment.
"The hallmark of the great human experiment
"is the willingness to recognize one's mistakes.
"Some mistakes, such as Madam Curie's discovery of radium,
"turned out to have great scientific potential,
"even though she would later die a slow, painful death "from radiation poisoning.
Another example, from the field of Ebola research..."
We're okay.
- Six two inch dowels. - Check.
- One package Phillips head screws. - Check.
You guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay?
I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was, like, 12.
I think I can put together a cheap, Swedish media center.
No, please. We insist. It's the least we can do, considering.
Considering what?
How great this place looks?
- Oh, boy. I was afraid of this. - What?
These instructions are a pictographic representation
of the least imaginative way to assemble these components.
This, right here is why Sweden has no space program.
Well, it looked pretty good in the store.
It is an inefficient design. For example, she has a flat screen TV,
which means all the space behind it is wasted.
- We could put her stereo back there. - And control it how?
Run an infrared repeater.
Photo cell here, emitter here, easy-peasy.
How are you gonna cool it?
- Hey, guys, I got this. - Hang on, Penny.
How about fans? Here and here.
Also inefficient, and might be loud.
How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here,
run some quarter-inch PVC...
Guys, this is actually really simple.
Hold on, honey. Men at work.
The PVC comes down here.
Maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.
Yeah? Show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice, and an overflow reservoir.
If water's involved, we're gonna have to ground the crap out of the thing.
It's hot in here. I think I'll just take off all my clothes.
Oh, I've got it.
What about if we replace
panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft-grade aluminum?
Right. Then the entire thing is one heat sink.
You and Sheldon go to the junkyard and pick up
6 square meters of scrap aluminum?
Raj and I will get the oxyacetylene torch.
- Meet back here in an hour? - Done.
Okay, this place does look pretty good.
Previously on The Big Bang Theory:
I'm going to the Arctic Circle with Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali.
- For three months? - Yes.
What did you mean when you said you were going to miss me?
It means I wish you weren't going,
Oh, thank God we're home.
I can't believe we spent three months in that frozen hell,
It was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening.
I don't know what Arctic expedition you were on...
...I thought it was a hoot and a half.
Oh, hi, Mom.
No. I told you I'd call you when I got home. I'm not home yet.
All right. I'm home.
The Arctic expedition was a remarkable success.
I'm all but certain there's a Nobel Prize in my future.
Actually, I shouldn't say that. I'm entirely certain.
No, Mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my safety.
The fact that I'm home safe doesn't prove it worked.
That logic is post hoc ergo propter hoc.
No, I'm not sassing you in Eskimo talk.
- I'm gonna let Penny know we're back. - Mother, I have to go.
Yeah, love you. Bye.
Hello, old friend.
Daddy's home.
Leonard, you're back.
Yeah, I just stopped by to say...
- Yeah, so hi. - Hi.
Damn it, I should've gone over and told her we were back.
Yeah, it was first come, first serve.
I just want you both to know, when I publish my findings...
- ...I won't forget your contributions. - Great.
I can't mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech.
When I write my memoirs...
...you can expect a very effusive footnote and perhaps a signed copy.
- We have to tell him. - Tell me what?
Damn his Vulcan hearing.
You are planning a party for me, aren't you?
Okay, Sheldon, sit down.
If there's going to be a theme, I should let you know...
...I don't care for luau, toga or under the sea.
Yeah. We'll keep that in mind. Look, we need to talk to you...
...about something that happened at the North Pole.
If this is about the night the heat went out...
...there's nothing to be embarrassed about.
- It's not about that. - We agreed to never speak of it again.
So we slept together naked.
It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.
- He's speaking about it. - For me it was a bonding moment.
Sheldon, you remember the first few weeks...
...we were looking for magnetic monopoles and not finding anything...
...and you were acting like an obnoxious giant dictator?
I thought we were gonna be gentle with him.
That's why I added the "tator."
And when we finally got our first positive data...
...you were so happy.
Oh, yes. In the world of emoticons, I was colon, capital D.
Well, ahem, in actuality, what your equipment detected...
...wasn't so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles...
...as it was static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off.
He just went colon, capital O.
- You tampered with my experiment? - We had to.
It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian.
You see that? I added the "ensian."
Did Leonard know about this?
Leonard's my best friend. Surely Leonard didn't know.
- It was his idea. - Of course it was.
The whole plan reeks of Leonard.
- I missed you so much. - I missed you too.
- I couldn't think of anyone else. - Me neither.
Except for one night when the heat went out.
Long story. It's... Don't ask.
Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.
Do not make a sound.
Whispering, "Do not make a sound"...
...is a sound.
Damn his Vulcan hearing.
Not a good time, Sheldon.
Penny. Penny. Penny.
Ugh, this is ridiculous.
- What? - Hello, Penny.
I realize you're currently at the mercy of your biological urges...
...but as you have a lifetime of poor decisions ahead, may I interrupt this one?
Great to see you too. Come on in.
Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception.
Do you have anything to say?
Yes, I feel terrible about it. I will never forgive myself.
I don't expect you to. I'd appreciate it if you'd leave me with Penny...
...for a session of self-criticism and repentance.
Can someone tell me what's going on here?
What's going on is I was led to believe I was making strides in science...
...when in fact I was being fed false data...
...at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy.
Is that true?
- It was the only way to make him happy. - Why'd you have to make him happy?
Because when he wasn't happy we wanted to kill him.
That was even a plan.
We were going to throw his Kindle outside.
And when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death.
- That seems like a bit of an overreaction. - No.
The overreaction was to tie your limbs to four different sled-dog teams...
...and yell, "Mush!"
Look, we kept the original data. You can still publish the actual results.
Yes,, but the actual results are unsuccessful.
I sent an e-mail to everyone at the university...
...explaining I confirmed string theory...
...and forever changed man's understanding of the universe.
Oh. See, yeah, you probably shouldn't have done that.
So write another e-mail. Set the record straight. It's no big deal.
You're right, Leonard. That's not a big deal.
All you did was lie to me, destroy my dream...
...and humiliate me in front of the whole university.
That, FYI, was sarcasm.
I, in fact, believe it is a big deal.
- Oh. That poor thing. - Yeah, I feel terrible.
Wait. Aren't you gonna go talk to him?
Well, I... He'll be fine. The guy's a trouper. Come here.
No, no, you're right. You shouldn't talk to him. I will.
Man, I cannot catch a break.
- Hey. Do you wanna talk? - About what?
Being betrayed by my friends?
Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing?
And I didn't even get to go to Comic-Con.
Oh, hon...
Soft kitty, warm kitty
That's for when I'm sick. Sad is not sick.
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't know your sad song.
I don't have a sad song. I'm not a child.
Well, you know, I do understand what you're going through.
Really? Did you have the Nobel Prize in waitressing...
...stolen from you?
Well, no.
But, uh, when I was in high school, one of my friends heard...
...I was gonna be named head cheerleader. I was so excited.
My mom even made me a celebration pie.
Then they named stupid Valerie Mosbacher head cheerleader.
Big old slutbag.
Are you saying that you think a celebration pie...
...is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?
Well, they're pretty tasty.
And on a different but not unrelated topic...
...based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits...
...do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?
Look, I just don't think that the guys and Leonard...
...really meant to hurt you. They just told an unfortunate lie...
...to deal with a difficult situation. You know what it's like?
Remember the new Star Trek movie? Kirk has to take over the ship...
...so he tells Spock stuff he knew wasn't true.
Like saying Spock didn't care his mom died.
I missed Comic-Con and the new Star Trek movie?
- I like the new look. - Thanks.
I call it the Clooney.
I call it the Mario and Luigi, but whatever.
Hey, how's Sheldon doing?
He came out of his room wearing his Darth Vader helmet...
...and tried to choke me to death with the Force, so I'd say a little better.
If I may abruptly change the subject, did you and Penny finally...? You know.
- Howard. - I don't care...
...but my genitals wanted me to ask.
Tell your genitals what I do with Penny is none of their business.
He says they didn't do it.
Sheldon, over here.
What are you doing?
Well, I feel bad for the guy.
Sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?
Because I am without friends.
Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone.
Even while seated.
Come on. We said we were sorry.
It's going to take more than an "I'm sorry"...
...and an apology pie from Penny to make up for what you've done to me.
Hey, Cooper. Read your retraction e-mail.
Way to destroy your reputation.
You see? People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.
It's not true.
People have been pointing and laughing at you your whole life.
All right, I've had enough. Attention, everyone.
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
As many of you in the Physics Department know...
...my career trajectory has taken a minor detour.
Off a cliff.
- My credibility may have been damaged. - Completely wrecked.
But I would like to remind you that in science there's no such thing as failure.
There once was a man...
...who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant...
...as the single biggest blunder of his career.
That man's name was, surprise, surprise, Albert Einstein.
Yeah, but research into dark energy proved...
...Einstein's cosmological constant was actually right all along.
So you're still, surprise, surprise, a loser.
Oh, you think you're so clever.
Well, let me just tell you. While I do not currently have a retort...
...check your e-mail periodically for a doozy.
So much for our friendship with Sheldon.
Well, we'll always have the night the heat went out.
- Hi. - Hey.
Since we got interrupted last night, I didn't have a chance to give you this.
Aw, Leonard. You shouldn't have.
Oh, boy. Ha, ha.
What is it?
It's a snowflake from the North Pole.
- Are you serious? - Uh-huh.
It'll last forever. I preserved it in a 1-percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.
God, that's the most romantic thing anyone's ever said to me...
...that I didn't understand.
It's actually a pretty simple process.
You see, cyanoacrylates are monomers, which polymerize...
Red alert. Leonard, Sheldon ran away.
Man, I cannot catch a break.
So how do you know he ran away?
I mean, he's not answering his phone, he handed in his resignation...
...and he sent me a text that said, "I'm running away."
Okay. Thanks for letting me know.
Well... Leonard. Aren't you gonna do something?
Well, of course I'm gonna do something.
Uh, Howard, check the comic-book store.
Raj, go to the Thai restaurant. I'll stay with Penny in her apartment.
Oh, damn it.
It's Sheldon's mother.
A break cannot be caught.
Hi, Mrs. Cooper.
He is?
Sheldon went home to Texas.
Yeah... No, I know he resigned.
Yes, I guess it kind of is our fault.
No, no. You're right. Someone needs to come talk to him.
Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Yeah. All right.
New plan.
Howard, you and Raj go to Texas, I'll stay with Penny in her apartment.
- You're not gonna go with them? - Well, you know...
...I gave you the snowflake, and we were kissing, and...
Come on. I don't wanna go to Texas.
Oh, right. And I do? My people already crossed the desert once. We're done.
Trust me, you'll be fine. See you.
Well, wait a second, Leonard. Come on. How can you not go?
- He's your best friend. - But I already saw him naked.
- Just come here. - No.
I promise I will be here when you get back.
Just go help Sheldon.
- Really? - Yeah.
We waited a few months. We can wait a few more days.
Maybe you can.
Go.
Boy, you cannot catch a break, can you?
- Here you go, Shelly. - Thanks, Mom.
Yeah.
Hold your horses, young man. Here in Texas, we pray before we eat.
Oh, Mom.
This is not California, land of the heathen.
Give me.
By his hand we are all...
Fed.
- Give us, Lord, our daily... - Bread.
- Please know that we are truly... - Grateful.
- For every cup and every... - Plateful.
Amen.
Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?
My objection was based on considerations other than difficulty.
Whatever. Jesus still loves you.
Thank you for carving a smiley face in my sandwich.
I know how to take care of my baby.
His eyes came out a little thin, but you can just pretend he's Chinese.
So do you want to talk about what happened...
...with you and your little friends?
- They're not my friends. - All right.
If you recall, when you were little we sat right here at this very spot...
...and talked about the problems you had getting along with the neighbor kids.
That was different. They were threatened by my intelligence...
...and too stupid to know that's why they hated me.
Oh, baby, they knew very well why they hated you.
I can't believe you bought a red cowboy hat.
Hello? I'm wearing a red turtleneck.
Plus it was the only boys' large they had.
I'm sorry. This does not look like Texas. Where's the tumbleweeds?
- Where's the saloons? - Saloons?
Like in the movies I saw growing up.
You know, uh, 4 for Texas, Yellow Rose of Texas.
This neighborhood is more Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
I was really hoping to see a cattle drive.
What can I tell you?
They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over there.
Will you please take that stupid hat off?
No, I wanna blend in.
To what? Toy Story?
Hi, boys.
- Howdy, ma'am. - Howdy to you too. You got here quick.
- We took the redeye. - Come on in.
Thank you kindly.
- Can I get you something to drink? - No, thank you.
If y'all don't mind, I got a hankering for a Lone Star Beer.
There's no alcohol in this household, stop talking like that and lose the hat.
Sorry. I'll take a diet Yoo-hoo if you have it.
You'll take a cola.
What about you? Raj, is it?
Oh, you still having trouble talking to the ladies? Ha-ha-ha.
Because, you know, at our church...
...we have a woman who's an amazing healer.
Mostly she does crutch and wheelchair people...
...but I bet she'd be willing to take a shot...
...at whatever Third-World demon is running around inside of you.
If you don't mind, there's a 3:05 nonstop back to Los Angeles...
...and you have no idea how much I wanna be on it.
- A girl? - Uh, yes, ma'am.
Oh, good. I've been praying for you.
Oh, Sheldon.
What are they doing here?
- We came to apologize. - Again.
And bring you home. Pack up your stuff and we'll head back.
No. This is my home now.
Thanks to you, my career is over. I will spend the rest of my life here...
...trying to teach evolution to creationists.
You watch your mouth, Shelly.
Everyone's entitled to their opinion.
Evolution isn't an opinion, it's fact.
And that is your opinion.
I forgive you, let's go home.
Don't tell me prayer doesn't work.
How about that? Finally caught a break.
Uh-huh.
You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?
Sure.
- Why does it have to get weird? - Pbbt. I don't know.
I mean, we were friends and now we're more than friends.
And we're whatever this is. But why label it, right? I mean...
It is what it is and...
- Leonard? - Yeah?
- It's weird. - Totally.
Sheldon, you're wrong.
Wolverine was not born with bone claws.
Howard, you know me to be a very smart man.
Don't you think if I were wrong, I'd know it?
- First of all... - Give it up.
You're arguing with a crazy person.
I'm not crazy. My mother had me tested.
Hey, guys.
What are you doing here?
What? It's new-comic-book night.
Since you and Penny hooked up...
...we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night.
There's more to life than sex, Raj.
Who had Leonard flames out in 24 hours?
I did.
Nothing flamed out.
We don't have to have sex every night.
You don't have to, but it's highly recommended.
Take advantage of that window of opportunity...
...before it slams shut on your little dinky.
It's not a matter of opportunity.
We're getting to know each other. There's a learning curve.
What's to learn? You get naked, do nasty things.
Then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami. Easy-peasy.
Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to...
...is the occurrence of sexual dysfunction.
Okay, who had Leonard gets a floppy disk?
Oh. A clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow...
...to the male sex organ.
Nothing like that happened, all right? The sex was just fine.
Just fine?
Oh, dude, the fourth Harry Pottermovie was just fine.
I'm not saying it was bad. I'm just saying it wasn't great.
Okay, you mean for both of you?
Because we can totally see it not being great for her. Am I right?
To tell you the truth, I think we were both a little... I don't know...
- Disappointed? Let down? - Ashamed? Horrified? Repulsed?
All I know is it wasn't the way I dreamed it would be.
Sex is never the way I dream it's gonna be.
That's because in your dreams, you're a horse from the waist down.
Excuse me, Wolverine: Origin Miniseries Issue 2, page 22.
Retractable bone claws.
If you spent less time thinking about sex and more time on comic books...
...we'd have far fewer of these embarrassing moments.
Sheldon, dinner's here.
Tandoori Palace?
No, we went somewhere new.
You're good-naturedly ribbing me, aren't you?
No, look, Mumbai Palace.
Why? Why would we change?
We had a perfectly good palace. Tandoori Palace is our palace.
Trust me, this will be just fine.
You are the authority on just fine.
What's that supposed to mean?
Exactly. Not bad, but not great.
- What are they talking about? - I don't know.
- I know. As I'm sure you're aware... - Dut! Dut-dut-dut-dut!
If that's Morse code, that's terrible.
As I was saying, you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter.
Earlier this evening, Leonard characterized it as, "Just fine."
So, what you're seeing is a continuation of the mocking that followed.
Okay. Yeah, well, I'm just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere.
Maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside.
Penny, wait. Aah.
What is wrong with you?
I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.
- Yeah, you... - Don't tell him.
Let's see if he can figure it out.
- Ugh. I am so embarrassed. - Please don't be mad.
- What did you tell them? - Nothing bad.
Just that last night was fine.
Fine? You said it was fine?
Yeah. It's a perfectly good word.
You put it in front of "wine" or "dining" and you've really got something.
Okay, well, let me ask you this, how was last night for you?
It was...
...okay.
Okay?
Yeah, it's a perfectly good word.
I mean, you put it in front of "dokay" and you really got something.
All right, let's not overreact.
It takes time to get to know each other's rhythms.
Learn what the other person wants and likes.
- So you've been through this before? - No.
Okay-dokay.
This is one of those things where talking about it is not gonna make it better.
- Want a glass of wine? Okay. - So much.
See, we should've done this last night, you know?
Had a little wine, take the edge off.
Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells...
...and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters...
...like gamma-aminobutyric acid.
Don't talk. Just drink.
No, you're misunderstanding.
A shiksa goddess isn't an actual goddess.
We don't pray to them. We prey on them.
Whatever, dude. The point is Leonard's got one and you don't.
Is this it?
It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny's sex life...
...in front of Leonard and Penny.
Good.
Now I can eat.
- What's that? - Sounds like a cricket.
Hang on.
Based on the number of chirps per minute and the temperature...
...it is a snowy tree cricket.
Oh. Give me a fricking break. How could you possibly know that?
In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined there was a fixed relationship...
...between the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature.
A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets.
How do you know the temperature of this room?
Under the terms of my roommate agreement I've had control...
...of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of '06.
Okay, you were right about Wolverine and bone claws...
...but you're wrong about the cricket.
Howard, don't embarrass yourself. The science chirps for itself.
Humorous word play.
No, no. Not this time. I know insects, my friend.
I spent many childhood years capturing them with nets, putting them in jars...
...sticking pins through them, mounting them on cardboard with labels...
...identifying the genus and species.
In Latin.
Oh. Dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess.
That is a snowy tree cricket. Oecanthus fultoni.
I was done with Latin by fifth grade.
Okay. Tell you what.
I am willing to bet anything that's an ordinary field cricket.
- I can't take your money. - What's the matter, you chicken?
I've always found that an inappropriate slur.
Chickens are not at all timid.
In fact, when I was young, my neighbor's chicken got loose...
...and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house.
- Chickens can't climb trees. - Thank God.
Okay, I believe a chicken made you his bitch.
The cricket thing, I don't buy. Bet me.
Fair enough.
What stakes do you propose?
I will put up my Fantastic Four Number 48...
...first appearance of Silver Surfer...
...against your Flash 123, the classic "Flash of Two Worlds" issue.
All right, you have a wager.
Hmm.
Great. Now, how are you gonna settle it? Hmm?
There is no way to determine the species of the cricket without examining it.
I wonder what the non-pathetic people are doing tonight.
- More wine? - Hit me.
- I don't see anything. - Shh.
Hallway.
Ahh.
One at a time.
What was that?
My stomach.
Indian food doesn't agree with me.
Ironic, isn't it?
Elevator shaft.
Help me open it.
Are you crazy? We can't go down an empty elevator shaft.
If you don't wanna proceed, then you forfeit the bet...
...and I'll take possession of your Fantastic Four.
Let's open her up.
Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?
Don't push me, Sheldon.
I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13...
...and I remember a good deal of it.
Oh, really?
I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister.
And I could easily best you in any physical confrontation.
Be it noogies, swirlies or the classic, "Why are you hitting yourself?"
Ooh. Big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken.
- Ahem. - What are we drinking now?
Peppermint schnapps.
Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?
Because I like peppermint and it's fun to say "schnapps."
- Hey, Leonard? - What?
Schnapps.
Schnapps.
You're right, that is fun.
Be careful.
If I were not being careful...
...your telling me to be careful would not make me careful.
Stairwell.
Uh-oh. Flashlight went out. I need some batteries.
Fellas?
Hello?
It's really dark down here.
Oh, sweetie, you really can't hold your liquor, can you?
I'm okay.
Just a little mouthwash and then I'm gonna rock your world.
Are you okay?
Oh. Toby, what did you do in a past life to be so disgusting now?
His name isn't Toby.
Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.
- What would you name him? - An appropriate cricket name.
For example, Jiminy.
All right, Sheldon, here we go.
Kleingast's Field Guide to North American Insects.
Hey, Toby.
Right here.
See it? "The common field cricket, a.k.a. Gryllus assimilis"...
...which is Latin for "suck it, you lose."
Hang on.
Voilà. "The snowy tree cricket, a.k.a. Oecanthus fultoni"...
...which is Latin for "I'll suck nothing."
Of course, I'm joking, because the Latin for that is "nihil exsorbibo."
That is not Toby, this is Toby.
Raj, what do you think?
Oh. I really don't care anymore.
- God, I had the most horrible night. - What happened?
Obviously another carnal fiasco with the "shiksi" goddess.
Shiksa. Shiksa.
Forgive me. Yiddish was not spoken in East Texas.
And if it was, it wasn't spoken for long.
Yeah, fine, whatever. The point is you're wrong, again.
We haven't established that I'm wrong once.
Let's go down to the Entomology Department...
...and let Professor Crawley tell us what kind of cricket Toby is.
He's a snowy tree cricket. And his name is Jiminy.
I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends.
Holy crap.
It's like Silence of the Lambs down here.
Don't do that.
Don't be such a girl. They're just bugs.
I don't like bugs, okay? They freak me out.
Interesting.
You're afraid of insects and women.
Ladybugs must render you catatonic.
It was a joke.
I made it to lessen your discomfort.
You're welcome.
Ha-ha. Don't knock. Just walk in.
Why be polite to the world's leading expert on the dung beetle?
Excuse me, are you Professor Crawley?
Who wants to know?
I'm Dr. Cooper, from the Physics Department.
- Couldn't wait, huh? - I'm sorry?
I haven't even packed yet and you're already measuring my lab...
...for one of your godless laser machines.
No, you don't understand. We just wanna ask you a question.
Let me ask you one first.
What's a world-renowned entomologist with a doctorate...
...and 20 years of experience, to do with his life...
...when the university cuts off the funding for his lab, huh?
Ask rhetorical questions that make people uncomfortable?
What's your deal?
Are they planning to outsource my job to Bangalore?
I'm from New Delhi.
- We should find another entomologist. - We're here. Let's settle this.
Professor, can you identify our cricket?
Of course I can.
I can identify every insect and arachnid on the planet.
Not that that's gonna keep me from having to move in with my daughter...
...in Oxnard. And we're not talking Oxnard at the beach. No.
We're talking Oxnard in the onion fields.
- Well, could you look at Toby? - Toby?
What a stupid name for a cricket.
Told you.
It's a field cricket.
- Yes. - No, wait.
Dr. Crawley, are you sure?
Young man, I've been studying insects since I was 8 years old.
You know what they used to call me in school?
Creepy Crawley.
Cruel as that may be, that is not in itself a credential.
Let me show you something.
See that? That's a Crawley's dung beetle.
I discovered it after spending six months...
...slogging through the Bornean rain forests...
...while my wife was back home...
...shacking up with a two-bit ornithologist...
...who lives on a sailboat and likes to wear boot-cut jeans.
So when I tell you that that's a common field cricket...
...you can take that to the damn bank.
Because God knows I can't.
That tramp took me for everything.
Well, apparently I was wrong.
Congratulations.
Enjoy Oxnard.
I'm sure your daughter's looking forward to having you.
Oh, hey, Sheldon. What you got there? New comic book?
Old comic book.
I just retrieved it from my safe-deposit box.
What do you have a safe-deposit box for?
Old comic books.
I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.
What, do they have Wii cricket now?
That can't be very popular.
Penny, I'd rather not talk about it.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'm not feeling so hot either.
Why would that make me feel better?
I don't know, empathy?
I'm just saying that you're feeling upset about something with Howard...
...and I'm upset about something with Leonard.
Yes, the disappointing sex.
That's an inexact parallel.
You and Leonard can always return to being friends.
I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me...
...like Mrs. Riley's chicken.
What's Mrs. Riley's chicken?
A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.
- Okay, forget the chicken. - I wish I could.
No, no. You may be right about me and Leonard.
Well, of course I'm right. What are the odds I'd be wrong twice in one week?
No, I mean, we can always go back to being friends.
I just said that... This conversation has started to circle. Meeting adjourned.
- Hello. - Hey.
What's going on?
Oh, you'd like to catch up on the events of the day. All right.
Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe-deposit box.
I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems.
And, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance...
...pride wenteth before my fall...
...causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz.
Wait a minute. You talked to Penny about our sex life?
Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial.
I lost a bet to Wolowitz.
- You're saying you talked to Penny? - Yes.
- Interesting. - Hardly.
Excuse me.
Have I crossed some sort of line again?
Little bit.
Hmm.
Oh. Who cares?
- Oh, hey. - Hey, what did Sheldon say to you?
Not a lot. That we always have the option of going back to being friends.
- Is that what you want? - I don't know.
I mean, you have to admit...
...things seemed simpler when we were just friends.
I guess.
- It would take the pressure off. - It would, wouldn't it?
So we'll just be friends.
Good. Good.
Come here.
Okay-dokay.

I'm not a chicken.You're a turkey.
This is your brain on drugs.
You gotta say no.
America, the not‐so‐distant future.
The economy is failing.
A despondent society has turnedto self‐medication.
Road fatalities, crime,
public disturbance, voice theft
all at record highs.
Just say no.
Something needed to be done.
Congress bravely votes to establisha modern day Prohibition.
Zero tolerance policy was adopted.
Overnight, the use, sale,and manufacturing of all alcohol
and narcotics of any kind became illegal.
Soon to emerge wasa better, sober America.
Inebriation, once viewedas socially appropriate,
was now taboo,
with just one exception.
Once a year, the embargo is lifted.
Narcotics once confiscated by policeare distributed to the highest bidder.
For 12 hours every year,
US citizens 18 and up are legally allowed
to participate in bill A2904,
known colloquially as simply.
'The Binge.'
♪ The Real McKenzies' Chip playing ♪
God bless America.
♪ Chip worked as a boatwrightas his father and his gran ♪
♪ A‐working in a boat yardbuilding on the River Thames ♪
Studies show that providing this outlet
to the populace just once a yearwould combat their urge
to indulge thereafter.
In fact only 23 percent of citizensattempt a second binge.
For a third, this number plummetsto just six percent.
Psychologists predict this mechanismmay annihilate
all clinical addiction by 2055.
Whether or not you choose to participate
or are merely an innocent bystander,
no one is left unaffected by The Binge.
Good morning, American High.
Flaming Eagles, I can't hear you!
As I said Flaming Eagles,I can't hear you!
For you seniors that are 18,in T minus nine hours,
you will be able to participatein your very first Binge!
We're gonna get so fucked tonight!
Hags, cậu phải điềm tĩnh mới được, rồi thể gì cậu cũng lươn lẹo thôi.
Guys, I only got two hobbies.Only two things I really spend my time on.
That's my woodworking, my elves,and that's making hummus.
And the other thing I do is protectthe reputation of American High.
My mom told me she usedto drink wine from a box
on the way home from work in college.
Ugh! We were born, like, way too late.
I can't control what you do out there,
but I can make a suggestion
as a concerned citizen and a mentor
and give you some pretty good reasonswhy we don't want you to Binge.
We've been prepping for this nightour entire lives.
I would fucking murder anyonewho gets in our way.
Now unfortunately for those of youthat do decide to Binge tonight,
all the regular laws,well, those are still in place,
and breaking those laws have consequences.
Yeah, consequences like you playingpenis Jenga with his daughter!
Will you be quiet?Lena almost heard you say penis Jenga.
Oh, I'm sorry, Lena almost heard mesay penis Jenga!
Hi, Lena.
See, bro, you gotta get her attention!I know.
I'm working on it. You just...You gotta let me do it my way, you know.
By writing a confusing sonnet?
It's not a sonnet,it's a series of haikus,
and I'm asking her to prom today.
Yeah, okay, you've been saying thatevery day for the past five months.
Well, tonight we Binge.
I'm gonna get you drunk enoughto finally make your move.
Yeah, except there's no wayLena's Binge‐ing,
and if Carlsen found out I binged,that'll be it.
He would never let me near Lena again.
You know, Amy Bagman thoughtit was rite of passage.
She binged.
And then a couple of uppers and downersand siders into it
she found herself on a private jetwith 12 'Saudi princes.'
Never to be heard from again.
- Oh shit!- Now, is she alive today?
Is she dead?Is she even worse off than that?
Even her family can't answerthat question.
Sad.
That's really what you want?
To be on a private jet?Abso‐fucking‐lutely!
One day, you'll have no one.
All you'll have left is the memories.
So you gotta make your life matter.
Let me assure you,I will spend...
Nothing matters.
Then there was Allen Reedwho was excited
about getting accepted into Stanford
until he was caught doingthe Brazilian tuck
outside a TJ MAXX.
Yeah, laugh it up. It's fun, right?
Maybe your name's Kimberly Jones?
Oh! There's my setup.
Please don't say 'I'll havewhat she's having.' Don't say that.
I have to say it,because it's hilarious.
It's not hilarious...
It is hilarious, brother.We went over this, okay.
Make everyone in the assembly laugh,
then we win the Gauntlet tonightat the Library Party.
You fellas need wristbandsfor the Library Party tonight?
We got some.
But the jet‐ski was still attachedto the dock, and it never took off.
And then eventuallyit exploded into flames.
Now, Kimberly Jones is here tonight.
Can you guys guess which one she is?
I'll give you a hint. You're cold, cold.
Getting warmer, getting warmer, red hot.
Burning hot. That's Kimberly Jones.
Wrapped up like a mummy becauseshe's ashamed of the way she looks.
She works here at the high school.
She makes the butterscotch pudding,and she does a wonderful job.
We're proud of you, Kim.
And she's never reallyallowed up before lunch
because again, she's disgustingand revolting to look at,
and it'll make your stomach churnand make you unable to eat.
And on that note,please stop emailing me, Kim,
about the Fantas in the mini‐fridge.
I'm gonna explode.I've said it to you six times.
I wanna treat you like a lady today,in front of everybody.
'Cause you are one.
I'd like to see everyone here go onand have a bright future
and not end up...like some of the people that we've seen
in front of us here today.
I'll have what she's having!
What?
You'll have what who's having?
Fucking dork.
You'll have whatthis burn victim's having?
Are you drawing attentionto the burn victim?
Kimberly Jones, who was tweaking
and got burned from her face to her feet?
And how do you think it makesa burn victim feel
when you single 'em outin front of everybody?
Kim, how's it make you feel?
Does it make you this?Does it make you happy?
Right? Or does it make you this?
I feel sad too.
I feel sad for Kim.
Sit down. You got30 minute detention on Tuesday.
You're gonna learn some empathy.I'm gonna have you read
about circus freaks, deformed people,
and people with the kind of burnsthat she has, how repulsive it is,
- and how hard it is to live with it.- Oh my god.
You'll get 'em next time, buddy.Oh my god.
Any questions?
Can I get a cawww!
Caw!
Can I get a cawww!
Cawww!
Let's go learn.
My uncle said his friend would do,like, a handstand
on a barrel of beer until he choked.
Yeah. It's called a keg stand.
What's a keg?
Man, did I misread the room.
Oh, I thought it was funny.
Thank you, Andrew,but I don't need your sympathies.
I was just rejected by my peers,and I'm in a bit of a fragile state.
I heard if you do Mollyand drink a Mountain Dew,
you start to see the future,but it doesn't even pertain to you at all.
Really?Yeah.
My older cousin sawsome random dude in Wisconsin's future.
Other Man's Future Syndrome. Sick.
I don't know, man. I workedreally hard to get into Brown.
Man, fuck college! What is this,the '90s? We have the internet.
Even if I wanted to go,our parents will never let us
skip out on their tradition.
Look, Griffin.I love our parents, right. I do.
But I'm not spending another Binge
at 'Soda‐Pop Game Night'doing the Root Beer Goat.
I won't do it.
What are you wearing?You look like my bubbe's couch.
Okay, see, you know nothingabout style, right.
You don't. Which is why I took the liberty
of getting youyour very first Gauntlet outfit.
Here we go.
Overalls, baby. Happy Binge, pal!
- FBF?- Mm‐hmm.
First Binge forever!
Hags, I'm not Binge‐ing, man.I'm definitely not wearing overalls.
Please take them back. Please.Okay, see, you are Binge‐ing,
and overalls are chick magnets, man.
They say if you keep it tight up top,
below the waist, it's anyone's guess.
Who says that?Who says that about overalls?
I do. And Lena's gonna love 'em!
I heard if you eat mushroomsand sacrifice an animal,
your entire world turns into a musical.
There's no way that's true, Kathleen.
Is that how you wanna end up?
Hey hey, ho ho...
Hell yeah, man, we can beat that.
When we win the Gauntlet tonight,I want our names to be etched in stone.
Will you put that away?
Principal Carlsen's gonna see it,and there goes any shot I had with Lena.
Who gives a fuck, Griffin?
You think he'd want some scared kiss‐ass
who volunteers to clean up shitsin the chem lab date his daughter?
No! He wants a man!
Come on now.Gotta you show you the closer.
The closer?
So you know my senior shop projectI told you I was working on?
Yeah, man, the one you hadthe GoFundMe for
when you were buildingthe reusable hydration systems
for third world countries.
I was really proud of you for doing that.
Yeah, man, fuck hydration. I lied.I put that money to much better use.
I donated $75.
Griffin, I give to you the mostimportant invention since the toilet,
The BoozeCycle!
Whoa, man. You built this?Yeah, man.
This is awesome.
Isn't it great?
Imagine if you put your mindto something useful.
Useful? This is the mostuseful thing I've ever done.
Is it a car? Kind of.
Is it a bicycle? Almost.
Griffin, this thing fucks!
I mean, it does. It's really cool.
It's just, how would we even pedal itwith two people? There's ten seats.
Hey, why you gotta be so negative, bro?
And El Pantera, that's just a myth.Like Santa Claus.
You know what , man. I'm sorry.I don't mean to be a Debbie downer.
I'm just‐I'm nervous, you know.Aren't you scared? Like, at all?
Scared of what? Becoming a legend?
No, of just‐I don't know. Everything.
Lena, Carlsen, alcohol poisoning,
our lives turning into a musical.
That sounds terrible.
Griffin, we'll be fine. I'll bewith you every step of the way.
That's what I'm scared about.
Ha ha. Oh, okay, you make jokes,
but you don't realize thatI'm a human, with emotion,
and it hurts my feelings.
I love you, okay. I really do.
And I appreciate yougetting me a wristband
and stealing from all those peoplewho desperately need clean water
to build a BoozeCycle...
Which is awesome.It is,
but I'm just gonna stick to tradition,
do Root Beer Goat‐Night with our parents,and wake up tomorrow
to continue my extended reignas mayor of Virgin City.
Good to know, Mr. Mayor!
Lena! Hey.
Lena, please don't call him Mr. Mayor.
Mr. Mayor is his father.
I like to refer to my brother hereAS BABE: Pig In The City.
Hmm. Because he's gotthe thickest hog in the game.
That's not...
I've never once heard anyonerefer to him as Babe,
and I've known him since preschool.
That's 'cause they whisper it to him.They don't do that.
They don't whisper anything.
So, you whisper 'Babe'into Griffin's ear
because he hasthe thickest hog in the game?
Okay, Lena. This is weird now.Right? So I'm gonna go.
Lena. Babe.
I have a normal‐sized hog,
probably no different than the next one.
Not that I've seen,
uh, but naturally you do find yourselfin positions where you see other hogs
and in those situations, I found that...
my hog is...
comparable, if not the same
in thickness to those...
That's good to know.
Um... so are you gonna Binge?
After your dad's speech?
You'd have to be a certified dip‐shitto go out tonight.
Well, I guess I'm the mayorof Dip‐Shit City
'cause I'm seriously thinking about it.
Me too, by the way.
I was completely joking beforeabout the dip‐shit thing. That's...
But, um...
Griff, is everything okay?
It is. Uh...
You know how our moms usedto go to Zumba class together?
Yeah! Yeah, we used to playfake house in the kid's room.
To this day, no one makesfake French toast as good as you.
And no one did our fake taxes forour fake mortgage better than you, so...
And now we're fake home owners!
That fake debt collectorwon't stop hounding me!
Um, anyways, I was just thinking how
we've always been in each other's lives.
Yeah.And, um,
Lena, I was wondering if...
Oh my god!
What is this?
'This promposal you can't ignore,
'because there's still so much more.
'Let's laugh and be merry,because the next clue you'll find
'at the Carnegie Library!
Here's hoping you will attend,and while you're at it, bring a friend!'
Holy shit!
Griffin, did you do this?
Um...
Are you kidding me? Oh my god!
When did this happenand why didn't you tell me?
No, no, no, it is happening right now.You are witnessing it.
This is awesome.Who do you think did it?
I don't know! Um, Max Keiser?
Maybe it was Ian Greenstein?
Ian Greenstein? Yeah, he...
He liked your tweet 18 months agolike a total creep.
I bet it's Ian Greenstein.So many guys!
I know!Exciting.
Holy shit! This is huge. They sold outfor this, like, six months ago.
Griffin, would you bethe ultimate friend and take a pic?
Totally.Thank you!
Yeah, I can do that.Thank you!
Say 'Ian Greenstein.''
Ian Greenstein!
You guys are gonna really like that.
Thank you so much.Of course.
- So that's‐So...- Okay, bye, Griffin.
Who do you think did this?
The packageis basically fully stocked
with, like, colorful frozen drinksand tiny umbrellas.
I fucking love tiny umbrellas.
Do you think pink drinks, too, because.
My grandmother's seenthis show, it's called Sex and the City,
and they would just drink pink alcoholand have meaningless sex
with strangers of foreign descent.
I would do disgusting thingsto a foreign guy tonight.
Hmm.I'm talking full spit roast.
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
Hags, what the hell is wrong with you?
I'm so sorry, I just dropped my passportsomewhere around here earlier today.
I'm just trying to get right backto the motherland right after I graduate.
What?
Oh, my homeland.
You know I'ma hundred percent foreign, right?
Like, from another place.
Ha ha. Anyhoo, will I be seeingyou ladies at the Library Party tonight?
You're going to the Library Party?
Hell yeah I'm goingto the Library Party.
And I'm hoping that you'll check me out.
For what purpose?Excuse me.
Uh, isn't that a saying?
No, it's not.Words have consequences, Hags.
Okay, that's what it is.It's the language barrier thing.
That's what... that's what it was.
Because I'm from another place.I'm fully foreign.
Have you ever even been on a plane?
Hell yeah I've been on a plane.
Ha ha. Of course.
I'm actually a current cardholderof the mile high club.
Oh yeah?And the big dick club.
- Really?- Mm‐hmm.
Well, why don't you whip it outand show us?
Mmm. You see, I would,
but they keep the band room real cold.
It's not really a accurate depictionof my genitalia.
Hmm.
That's what I thought.
Virgin.
This is dry.Okay.
Chad, how are we?
Kurt, how come I never see youwith your shorts off?
- Seem a little locker room shy.- S‐Sir...
Wanna see how a man walks aroundthe locker room?
Um...Wanna take a look at it?
I'll pull my pants down, I'll go takea shit, I'll get in the shower.
You wanna watch it?
Whatever it is, get comfortable with it.It ain't going away.
Let's get behind those ears,okay, Bennett?
Yes, sir. That's wherethe germs live and they reproduce.
Got it.Don't be a pussy.
Chin up. Griffin, my man, how are you?
How's it going, Principal Carlsen?
Well, I'm always a little bit on edgewhen it comes to Binge night,
people get pushed to their moral limits.Me too.
I, I can't believe people Binge.
One shake and you're done, Tommy!
No one wants to watchyour dickplay in here.
At your age, you're a hair‐trigger.You're liable to blow all over the place.
Have a story about you for the restof your life. You want that?
Put the dick down.
Okay.
You know, Griffin, uh, Lena sayssome really nice things about you.
She does?
Yeah. She says that you're nice,that you work hard,
that you havepretty terrific table manners.
You know, I'll tell you, Griff,
I'm pretty okaywith... my daughter being friends
with a nice Brown man.
Let me walk that back just a little bit.
That's not the kind of quotethat you want taken out of context.
Congratulations on getting intoa great university, Brown.
Thank you, sir. And thank you againfor making that call to Dean Eckhouse.
It really made all the difference.
Well, Griff, you know,when you have a history of
recommendingoutstanding guys, like yourself,
they tend to listen to you.
And by the same token, if you ask themto rescind someone they're thinking about,
they go ahead and they listen loudand clear on that as well.
Since we're talkingabout scratching each other's backs,
I have just the smallest little itch
I was wondering if you could getyour fingernails on.
It's called where the fuckis the party tonight?
Sarah Martin's 'Dank‐Ass Pre‐Game'is already on my radar.
I understand they're thinkingof smoking a little bit of pot.
Maybe some Lean? A little Purple Drank.
You know what I'm talking about?Oh, I do, but I wouldn't.
I personally wouldn't sniff glueor drink Purple Drank
or just associatewith Sarah Martin at all.
Well, that's good.
That bitch has chaotic energy.
She's like a scorpion in a toaster.
Anyway, the point isif you hear of anything...
Of course.
Fair?Totally fair.
Fair?Fair. Very fair.
The hell is...
Principal Carlsen, I‐Um...
It's a funny story, I‐Uh...
I...Oh.
Oh. Actually, Principal Carlsen,that's not Griffin's.
No, see, I found that in the hallway,
and I gave it to Griffinto hold onto it for me.
Yeah, I just had no idea what it was.
Could it be ticketsto a renaissance fair or...
a petting zoo.
Yeah.
You gentlemen be safe tonight.
Yes, sir.
And Hags, do me a favor.
Try to find a nicknamethat's a little bit more normal.
Something like Lucas or Quan.
I'll see you Tuesday? Thirty minutes?
Thank you, Quan. Griff.
David, thank your brotherfor the meatloaf.
Yes, sir.
Whoa, thank Christ.
Oh, Griffin?Yup.
You know, there's a prank turdin the chemistry lab.
I was wondering if you could be an angel,sweep in and scoop that up.
I would love to do that.
Thank you, Quan.
Fuck! Quan?
Who the fuck is Quan?
And so it begins.
As school lets out, sirens pierce the air,
Informing the civilian populationof what's to come.
For some, a warning.
To those not participating, to get home,
bunker down, and pray for safety.
For others, it's the sound of celebration,
excess, freedom.
Underground competitionsknown as Gauntlets
capture the nation's attention.
Creating local legends in those who win
and lasting memories for all who compete.
Ten, nine
eight, seven, six,
five, four,
three, two, one!
Yahtzee!
Whoo!
Yeah.
Oh. To our sixth Binge Night Game Night!
Yep.What a great tradition!
This is fun.
It's just great being able to hangwith family on the night
when nobody else is doinganything awesome.
Oh, and we are just gratefulthat you boys would rather...
- Uh... men!- Excuse me.
That you men
would still rather pal aroundwith us middle ‐ aged fogies
than go out drinking with allthe other high school boys and girls.
Yeah, well, makes me hopefulfor the future.
Yep.Well, who's ready for round two?
Yeah.
We don't have to dothe thing again, Dad.
- We don't...- Oh no, let's do it.
Root beer goat!Ha ha!
Ah, somebody didn't goat.
Well, everybody goated so I...
Come on, son, you do the best goat.
I do a very normal goat.No, you...
Come on, give us a goat!
Give us a goat!You're so good.
You got it.
This is what I'm talking about.
That's a damn good goat!
So, Griffin, I heard you're going to promwith the Principal's daughter?
- Oh.- Prom.
Yeah, I, I was,but somebody else already asked.
- That's too bad.- I'm so sorry.
Oh, it's okay, Ma.
Most, most peopleprobably don't even remember
who they went to prom with.
Exactly.
Unh‐unh, you're looking at him.
He was so nervous when he asked me.
He had written a little poem outand everything.
He didn't even end up reading it.
Well, for what it's worth,I always thought
you and Lena made an adorable couple.
Do you want me to call her father?That's okay, Dad.
No, no, no, I'm not afraid to call him.I am.
You don't have to do that.No, you shouldn't be.
I don't think you should do that.
- Okay. Okay.- I appreciate that.
Hey, everybody. What's happening here?
Too early to fall asleep.
I bought Big Bang Theory Clue.
- Big Bang.- Mm‐hmm.
Let me get this straight,
Sheldon... kills...
- Penny.- Penny.
In the library?
No.The lab.
The lab.
With a... Galaxy 6, 6S.
Galaxy...
Eh, 6, Salaxy 6...
Bazinga.
Mom. Mom?
Dad?
Dad? Dad? Paul?
Stacy?
Come on, Griffin,let's get the hell out of here!
What the‐Wait, what the hell is this?
Hags, did you do something?
No! I just gave thema couple sleeping pills.
You roofied our parents?
I did not roofie our parents.The pills were in their medicine cabinet.
This is crazy!Griffin!
Your parents are spooning.My dad is snoring.
Mom's asleep. Let's go!No!
Tha‐I'm not going. I'm not leaving.
You have a wristband, that's it, okay.
You go without me.
Go without you?
Lena's gonna meether promposal mate there anyway.
I don't want to witness that.
Griffin, I was lyingwhen I said I wasn't scared.
I am scared.
But I'm not scared aboutwhat's gonna happen tonight.
I'm scared aboutwhat's gonna happen after tonight.
You're going to Brown.
And I'm gonna be stuck hereworking at Chuck E. Cheese.
And that's life, Griff.
Look, you go and you beat thatDr. Seuss promposal asshole to the punch.
You look Lena in the eyes and tell her
exactly what you've wantedto tell her your entire life.
Tonight we become legends, Griffin.
We go to that partyand we win that Gauntlet.
This is our last chanceto make a great memory.
Wow! That was really good.
That was good.Thanks.
Did you practice that?
A couple of times. Yeah.
Ughhh!
I know that groan!
Ah, I still don't have a wristband.
What is that? Hags, why are you winking?
Man,I just don't know about this.
I haven't been over to Andrew's housesince, like, the second grade
when his mom did that thingwith the mousetrap.
Who cares? He saidhe has extra wristbands.
You need a wristband. Ring the bell.
Should we call him?
He don't believe in phones.
Hello?
Hello?Hello, hello.
Hello? Andrew?
Hello?
Hi, Mrs. Hellmuth?
What do you want?
Uh, sorry for bargingin your home like this.
Is Andrew here?
Andrew?
My, uh...
Your...Your son.
Yeah. Son.
You're looking for him?
Uh, yes, ma'am.It's kind of an emergency.
You guys cops?
No.No.
We're just...We're in high school.
Griffin? Hags?
- Andrew!- Holy shi...
Uh, it's okay, Mom. These are my friends.
Your friends? Yeah, right.
I have friends, Mom!Why don't you believe me?
Why don't I believethat you have friends?
Probably because your tendencytowards violence
caused us to be bannedfrom the fucking church.
You didn't give memy calming pills! That's why.
I canceled our family trip to Renoto pay for your freaking calming pills!
Why do you think your father left?
You said my dad leftto pursue his dreams.
His only dream was to leave this house.
Happy Binge!
Fuck you, Mom!
I'll bury you behind a Jiffy Lube.And my friends are gonna help me!
We will not be doing that.We're not, we're not gonna do that.
I mean, I don't even know him now.
You think I'm afraidof a couple of puto cops?
I spent 18 years in a Bangkok prison
hanging upside down from my labia.
Two of those years,I was pregnant with you.
That's not even true, Mom.Who are you trying to impress?
Take these two guys up to my room
and show them the Chai Ming Fist Bump.
I don't wanna see that.
What the fuck does that even mean, Mom?
I'll burn that tongue if you ever speakto me that way again.
Do it!
Dinner's in ten.
I love you!I love you, too!
Give Mommy a kiss.
I'm so sorry about that, guys.
My mom, she just lovesshowing off in front of my friends.
Listen, Andrew,we're in a bit of a rush.
Uh, we just wanted to knowhow much we would have to pay you
for those wristbandsyou said you can get us?
Well, currency is an illusioninfluenced by a false reality.
I live my life on a bartering system.
Okay, we can work with that.Oh.
So what do you want?
To be your wingman tonight.
Well, of course you can, man.Really?
Yeah. That's...Whoa, wait a minute.
You see, me and Griffin, we're a duo.
We've never been a trio.What are you doing?
Right. Right, right, right. Okay, okay.
Andrew, do you mind if Griffinand I just have a sidebar over here.
Not about you, at all.
Is that okay? Thank you.What's going on?
Whoa, we can't bring him, bro.He's not helping our cool factor.
And you're doing wonders forour cool factor bringing bonus overalls?
Look, Lena has a wristband.Sarah has a wristband! I need a wristband!
And having another person to pedalthat monstrosity outside
- wouldn't hurt either.- Fine.
Fine. Andrew.
Yes.We're back. Sorry.
Uh‐huh.
What...You're in.
Yeah, you can be our wingman tonight.
What?
- Yeah.- Yes.
What?
Oh‐kay.
- Yeah. It's all right.- Oh my god!
Wow! Uh...
I swear... I will not let you guys down.
How 'bout those wristbands?
Ah, yes.
Actually, I 3D printed them.
I 3D print a lot of stuff.
Oh, awesome, man. These things...
Andrew, these are purple.
The Library Party wristbands are orange.
Yes. Hags, that isa very good observation.
You see, unfortunately,the guy I usually barter with,
he was all out of the orange filament so...
Well, that doesn't help us at all.Right, right, right. Uh...
My twin brother Seb has real ones.
Seb? 'The Ice Russian?'
Didn't he go to juvie for stabbingsome guy with a screwdriver?
Wait, he's your twin brother?
Yeah. From a different father.
Excuse me.What?
Heteropaternal superfecundation.
It's actually pretty common.

Why won't he live?
We gotta give her more drugs.

Holy shit!
Is that Principal Carlsen?
Hey, guys.
- Hey, Tyler. How are you fellas?- Hi.
Just curious, do you guys know any of the,uh, parties that are happening tonight?
Tonight? I haven't heard anything.
No? No idea.No.
Oh!
Do you think because I participatein Wacky Wednesdays
I can't get a little crazy, huh?
Just because I participatein Wacky Wednesdays
doesn't mean I can't changethe course of your life!
Does that make sense, you stupid ass?
Look, most people are goingto Carnegie Library.
All right?
Smart.
Hiding in plain sight.
Come on, big guy. That wasn't so bad.
Proud of the way you've conducted yourselfon and off the field.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's this? You guys gettin'into some slamballs?
Run your pockets.What's a slamball?
This is how it starts.
Little sip of wine,
some slamballs,
and then you leave your family
for an ATV instructor named Gabriel.
And then you stop being a mom
and participating in the family
because you're so ashamedfrom a life of porn,
you can't look your daughterin the eye anymore.
And guess who gets stuck holding the bag?
Dear old dad.
Is that gonna be you?
Are you gonna be a mom
that leaves her family?
Let me ask you a question, big boy.
Look at me.
Are you a mom that could walk outon her family?
No. No, sir.
Are you a mom that could walk outon his family?
I would never leave you.
The fuck makes you thinkI'm talking about me?
I thought we were just role‐playing.
I know it wasn't you.
If I was a mother,I would never leave my family.
That's all I know. Here,these are, these are all my drugs.
I'm sorry I lied to you,Principal Carlsen.
Why didn't we just start here
and skip all the hitting in thethroat stuff, huh?
You guys have a great night, okay.
You know what, we'll do better next time.
Oh.
And if anybody asks you guys,
just let 'em knowthat the Panther sent you.
Oh!
Who's the panther?Where's he supposed to send us?
- Oh shit!- Did you see that?
We have just experienceda serious trauma, people.
- Hey, why won't anybody pick us up?- ...dickless!
Uber says it's gonna take two hoursand it's surging 350.
This night slaps.
Best night ever.
Griff, you good?
Mark fucking Maynard.
This night slaps!
Night of our lives!Whoo!
Who else could it be?
Listen, man,Mark did not ask her to prom,
I know that for a fact.
Look, we cannot give up now.We are 6.8 miles away from that party.
And then when Lena sees you,there's no way she can say no to you.
Well, what would thateven look like, man?
'Hey, Lena, it's me.
'I'm really sorry for calling youa bitch earlier.
'It's probably because I was highoff my ass on PCP.
'I almost just diedafter crashing into a cow
'and they got absolutely fuckingdemolished by an 18 wheeler
'and as I'm sure you've noticed by now,I'm missing an entire fucking eyebrow.
'But hey, don't worry about it.
'It'll probably grow backin six to twelve months.
You wanna go to prom?'
Hey, you sold me.I'd say yes.
Mm‐hmm.
- Ow! What the shit?- Griffin.
Oh, something's in my ass.What?
My entire ass is on fire!
- Oh, that hurts...- Hey!
Hey, lookie‐lookie.
Big bro.
My good friend here,he wanted to ask his girlfriend to...
Andrew? Andrew!
Oh no!
Get 'em in the truck.
Will I be able to driveif I eat two Binge‐A‐Ritos?
I would not recommend it.
You're so stupid.

Six for 12 bucks.

Magic mushrooms?

Your Majesty.
Everyone at the Post Office is delighted with the new profile, ma'am,
which they feel to be an elegant reflection
of Her Majesty's transition from young woman to...
Old bat?
...mother of four and settled sovereign.
The Postmaster General himself commented that the two images,
the young and the slightly older Queen,
are almost identical.
Postmaster Bevins is very kind.
He's also a barefaced liar.
Just the tiniest changes, in the hair...
A great many changes.
But there we are.
Age is rarely kind to anyone.
Nothing one can do about it.
One just has to get on with it.
But, somehow, Harold Wilson had to inspire the electorate
to thrust a wedge into the Tories, to win the floating vote for Labour,
and stop the Liberals stealing too much of the cake.
Sir Alec's position could likewise be affected by the Liberals.
They've had quite a revival.
In the 1950 election, the Labour majority crumbled.
Some of its great figures were already ill.
The pressures of Korea and rearmament were growing.
It's never easy to fight an election.
- Louder, please. - Sir.
Your opponent's promises often seem so much more enticing.
...so many unknowns.
Even the weather can wash your hopes down the gutter.
At once Harold Wilson's life changed.
Oh, no!
What?
Winston's had another stroke.
- Oh, poor old thing. - I'll go and see him today.
You do know, if that man wins today, he'll want us out.
- Who? - Wilson.
Half his cabinet would be made up of rabid anti-monarchists.
They'd want our heads on spikes.
Vive la rÃ©volution.
Except I doubt they speak French in...
...Halifax or Huddersfield.
- The old order. - Or wherever he's from.
The old boys' network, the cozy...
I even heard a rumor that he's a KGB spy.
Mr. Wilson? That's ridiculous.
That his predecessor, Hugh Gaitskell, was poisoned by the Russians,
so that their man might take over.
- Who did you hear that from? - A friend of mine at the lunch club.
He had a whole theory
about Wilson being turned while on a trade mission to Russia.
Said he even had a KGB code name.
"Olding."
Well, if you know it, and your chum knows it,
obviously MI5 will know it,
and they must have come to the conclusion that Mr. Wilson was fine,
or they would have done something about it.
Unless they never expected him to get this far.
- ...the ruthless application... - No one did.
...of scientific techniques in Soviet industry...
can see clearly that only the state should have this level of control.
Good morning, Your Royal Highness.
Sir, a reminder that lunch is at one at the Mirabelle.
Tell her I'm not coming.
A Labour prime minister...
- Go on. Off you trot. - Sir.
Good morning, Your Royal Highness.
Who are you?
I'm new.
I'm assuming "new" is not your name.
No.
- So, when I ask you... - Violet, ma'am.
Where's the other one?
The... the fat one.
She left, ma'am.
Nervous exhaustion.
Yes?
Morning, ma'am. Lord Snowdon sends his apologies.
- What? - He's heading out to take photographs.
- What? - Of election day.
- No! - He will try and join you for coffee.
No!
Tony.
Open the door.
Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness.
Sir Anthony, what's all this?
Preparations for the forthcoming exhibition
at the Guildhall Gallery, ma'am.
- Of our paintings? - Portraiture in early modern Europe.
I believe you kindly agreed to say a few words.
- Did I? - That was a mistake.
Probably.
- Who's that by? - Annibale Carracci.
Never heard of him.
This one?
- Artemisia Gentileschi. - No, never heard of him, either.
Her, sir.
I'm afraid we're not great connoisseurs of art in this family.
No, we're country people, really.
- Savages. - I wouldn't say that.
But I just did say that.
Are you disagreeing with me?
I've always said, both the Queen and Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother
have a very good eye.
What? Between them?
One each.
Right, darling.
I'm off.
Eyes left.
Good luck with Winston.
If I am to say a few words,
I wonder if you might give me another of your wonderful tutorials.
With pleasure.
Your predecessor had very little patience with me,
whereas you've always been kind enough to make me feel, if not scholarly,
then not stupid, which I appreciate.
So, to that end, what would you say constitutes early modern?
The end of the Middle Ages
to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.
Roughly late 15th century to late 18th century.
And what era are we in now, do you suppose?
The frighteningly modern?
I think that all depends on the result of the general election today.
Oh, yes. Have you voted? I know one shouldn't ask.
I have, ma'am.
- Conservative. - Really?
I always had you down as a man of the left.
Perhaps once. Not anymore.
- Who's this? - Rembrandt.
An Old Man in Military Costume.
Wonderfully enigmatic character.
Speaking of enigmas, what do we make of Mr. Wilson?
- One's heard the rumors, of course. - Rumors, ma'am?
Yes, whilst on a trade mission to Moscow, the KGB got to him.
Nonsense, I know.
I wouldn't dismiss them so quickly.
For a young socialist to visit Russia in those days,
with an impressionable mind.
It's not unthinkable he might have been turned to more... radical ideas.
But Mr. Wilson is an older man now,
and, I'm sure, a wiser one.
Harold Wilson's life changed dramatically.
From being a prominent opposition politician,
Harold Wilson became the opposition politician.
The potential prime minister and a servant of the Crown.
The Conservatives can afford to lose...
Sir, the Queen.
...a small but workable majority.
- Dear Winston. - Your Majesty.
Don't move.
How are you?
Gripped, ma'am.
It's a proper nail-biter.
...key battleground seats. The Midlands...
- You think Mr. Wilson has a chance? - I'm afraid I do.
I think we must face the cold wind of socialism
blowing through this land once more.
I probably shouldn't tell you this.
When I was Prime Minister...
a young Mr. Wilson came to me
asking my permission to go to Russia.
On behalf of...
the...
Board of Trade.
Yes. Board of Trade.
One of the first Western politicians to go behind the Iron Curtain.
I remember thinking then, "We'd better keep an eye on that one."
...see a clear picture emerging of who might be the likely winner.
I can't imagine what that would be like...
having a prime minister one didn't trust...
when one thinks what it was like with you...
I was a terrible bully.
You were my guardian angel.
The roof over my head.
The spine in my back.
The iron in my heart.
You were the compass that steered and directed me.
Not just me, all of us.
Where would Great Britain be without its...
greatest Briton?
God bless you, Winston.
After the generation of Conservative rule,
in which we have seen recession, scandal, national divide...
Go on, Margot. Do us one more song.
Yes, Margot. Your turn.
- Just one of those... - Jesus Christ.
Another gain for Labour there.
We've seen a 3.5% swing from the Conservatives so far tonight.
When we started painting the town
The haves and have-nots
and the fact that neither party has been able to secure the confidence
of a large majority of voters
is symptomatic not only of fundamental dissatisfaction with government,
but of the failure of the entire political class.
So goodbye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things
Bravo!
Thank you.
...arriving into us now.
Yes, it's a Labour gain.
The Labour Party will form the next government.
People will be waking up tomorrow in a new Britain,
a Britain whose destiny lies firmly in the hands of Mr. Wilson.
We now go over to Transport House,
where Labour staff and supporters are gathered to hear their celebration.
Then raise the scarlet standard high
Within its shade we'll live and die
Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer
We'll keep the red flag flying here
Sir, the protocol is as follows.
When you're announced, bow from the neck.
First time you see the Queen, you say, "Your Majesty."
After that it's "ma'am." Rhymes with "ham."
Until you leave, then it's "Your Majesty" again.
Don't sit until Her Majesty does. Don't talk until she does.
Absolutely no physical contact, other than taking her hand,
if and only if she offers it.
No small talk unless she invites it.
At the end, she'll buzz, and I'll come and get you.
Bow from the neck and walk back towards me.
The Leader of the Opposition, Your Majesty.
Mr. Wilson.
Thank you.
Your Majesty.
The country has spoken. Your party has won the election.
[Elizabeth[ The duty befalls me, as sovereign,
to ask you to form a government in my name.
Congratulations, Prime Minister.
Uh, well, I suppose I should kick things off with an apology.
- Whatever for? - Well, winning.
I'm aware of your affection for my predecessor
and doubtless you'd have preferred him to have continued in office.
It is my duty not to have preferences.
Well, we all do though, don't we? We can't help it. It's human nature.
And I can see the attraction of someone like Posh Alec.
Someone you can chat with about the racing,
someone well-bred, highborn, who knows how to hold his cutlery,
as opposed to a ruffian like me.
Hardly.
Still, the country said otherwise.
They'd had enough of the mess those Conservatives left us
and the havoc they wreaked.
Soaring land and house prices,
race riots, sex scandals,
large-scale unemployment, rejection from the EEC,
and an annual trade deficit of Â£800 million.
Yes, it's an unenviable legacy.
What will you do about the balance of payments? Will you devalue?
No, m-ma'am.
A Labour government devalued the pound once before, with little success,
and my party cannot risk being seen as the party of devaluation.
It is also a matter of national pride.
This is still a great country,
and the pound is a powerful symbol.
Can't have been an easy one to get used to.
What's that?
Well, you being part of that symbol.
Your face on every coin and banknote.
No.
I remember seeing my father's face on a shilling for the first time
and thinking how odd it looked.
At the same time realizing
I would probably, one day, have to look at my own face.
But one never knows what destiny has in store for one.
Did you ever imagine you'd be Prime Minister?
- Goodness, no. - How could you have done?
- Mr. Gaitskell was still such a young man. - He was.
No one could possibly have foreseen his death.
No.
- So sudden. - Yes.
And unexpected.
Yes.
Still, we make of our destiny what we can.
Indeed.
I'm not sure what I was expecting.
Each of his predecessors,
Churchill, Eden, Macmillan, even Alec,
each in their own way was formidable.
Statesmanlike.
But Wilson is neither old nor young,
tall nor short, loud nor quiet,
warm nor cold.
He seems to have come from nowhere and is entirely unremarkable.
Best qualities in a spy.
What did you say?
Aren't those the best qualities in a spy?
Well, to be forgettable, unremarkable.
Not stand out in a crowd.
We used to say that about Henry, didn't we, dear?
What?
That you would have made the perfect spy,
because no one could remember having met you.
I-I-I'd say that was marginally better
than everyone having nightmares having met you!
We do tease each other.
With Tony, one never knows quite who one's going to get
from one moment to the next.
He's changeable.
He goes from loving to hating. Mummy!
- You're not listening. - Hmm?
Of course I am, darling.
Tony doesn't hate you.
I think he may be starting to.
You must try not to let him consume you like this.
The two of you have your trip to America coming up.
Yes.
You'll be with each other round the clock, working together as a team.
Your father and I always found those trips very bonding.
Well, I hope you're right.
- Thank you. - Sir.
- From Margot. - Marvelous. Very good.
- How did you know? - Margot!
Seventeen minutes, door to door. I'm claiming that as a land-speed record.
Is there any food left, or have you eaten it all? Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty. A thousand apologies. - Hmm.
- Happy birthday, Henry! - Tony, where were you?
Oh, look.
- Hello. - Tony.
Tony, darling, come and sit next to your wife.
Why would I do that? I see her all the time.
Well, she was just saying she sees you none of the time.
Hmm, because he's always working, traveling, or waterskiing.
It's my new passion, ma'am.
Your Majesty, there's a telephone call for you.
- Oh, it's lovely there. - It's a ghastly little pond.
I think you'll find we own that pond.
I share a speedboat there with Simon Sainsbury.
You have to wind it up.
Well, the general idea is to stay out.
That's really charming. Elizabeth, thank you so much.
Really, really charming.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Henry
Happy birthday to you
- Hurrah! - That's enough.
Winston is dead.
Fire!
Sir, the CIA'S Director of Counterintelligence on the phone.
- I'll call him back. - He called on Juliet, sir.
Heads of state from around the world are arriving, crowding into...
Gentlemen.
...this great mother church of the Commonwealth.
- Jim? - Martin.
A man by the name of Michael Straight surrendered himself to us at the DOJ.
I need to speak to a senior intelligence officer.
He claims to be a sleeper agent working for the Russians.
He says he has information that will uncover a senior KGB mole
at the top of the British establishment.
- Where is he now? - Washington.
We can have him flown in to you by tomorrow.
We are assembled here as representing the people of this land
to join in prayer on the occasion of the burial of a great man,
who has rendered memorable service to his country
and to the cause of freedom.
We shall think of him with thanksgiving
that he was raised up in our days
of desperate need
to be a leader and inspirer of the nation,
for his dauntless resolution and untiring vigilance.
My name is Michael Straight.
And since all men are subject to temptation and error,
we pray that we, together with him,
may be numbered among those whose sins are forgiven...
and have a place in the kingdom of heaven.
I attended Cambridge University,
and it was during this time that I was first approached
by members of the Communist Party.
Right.
Right.
I'll confirm with Her Majesty and come back to you straight away.
Director General of MI5, Mr. Furnival Jones, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty. Thank you for seeing me.
It gives me no pleasure to tell you
that we have been approached by a former Russian agent
who has identified a mole at the top of the British establishment.
So, it's true.
- Ma'am? - I'd heard the rumors.
Initially, I dismissed them,
but spending time with him personally, in close proximity,
one had become more and more suspicious.
Indeed.
And that he should have been able to carry on for so long, undetected,
is a subject of enormous embarrassment to all of us.
This obviously needs to be handled very delicately.
That's what I've come to talk to you about,
to see if we might find a way to contain it.
What? We can't do that.
Have a Russian spy in Downing Street?
Oh. Those rumors. You're talking about Harold Wilson.
- Yes. - I'm so sorry, ma'am.
Yes, it's widely accepted
that repeated attempts were made by the KGB
to recruit Wilson when he was younger, working on trade missions.
He traveled to Russia a great deal in those years,
but the evidence for the Russians having succeeded is so weak,
we discounted it some time ago.
And the poisoning of Gaitskell?
Gaitskell wasn't poisoned. He died of lupus.
The fact is, even if the Russians had poisoned Gaitskell,
the most likely beneficiary would have been George Brown, not Harold Wilson.
Wilson was not favorite to take over the leadership at the time.
We don't have a Russian spy in Downing Street?
No.
But it seems...
we do have one in Buckingham Palace.
We look at a painting and immediately want to know it.
Understand it.
But can anything ever be fully understood?
Take our bearded trickster here.
A Venetian cardsharp originally ascribed to Titian,
until new evidence came to light,
proving the painting is actually by Lorenzo Lotto.
As time passes, so we learn.
Truths are revealed.
In the late Renaissance,
painting after painting, masterpiece after masterpiece
seemed full of hidden intentions, multiple meanings.
Annibale Carracci's Allegory of Truth and Time,
painted in 1584 or 1585.
This winged figure here
rescues a young woman, his daughter,
from the darkness.
He is time.
She is truth.
And this figure below,
trampled by truth, is deceit.
Carracci's message is clear.
Be patient. The truth will out.
I'm afraid I can now confirm that the Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures,
Sir Anthony Blunt, was the fourth man in the Cambridge spy ring.
The message encoded in the painting is repeated in reality.
As with the Lotto,
time passed, and the painting was restored
to reveal deceit is two-faced.
She has a second, monstrous visage.
And that alongside conducting a distinguished career as an art historian
and member of the royal household,
he spent 15 years as an active KGB mole
and passed almost 2,000 documents of sensitive military secrets
to the Kremlin.
Truth may lie beneath the surface, buried, forgotten,
but time has a way of uncovering it.
One thinks of The Merchant of Venice.
"Truth will come to light.
Murder cannot be hid long.
A man's son may...
but at the length, truth will out."
Thank you.
We had initially hoped the information was false.
We get these sorts of claims all the time. But...
we subsequently detained and interviewed Blunt, and...
I'm sad to say he has confessed.
In full.
What's the next step?
Well, as a traitor to his country,
he should, of course, stand trial, be put in prison,
and the key thrown away, quite frankly.
Unless it was felt that exposure of Blunt's treachery
could cause even more damage.
What, than keeping it silent?
How?
It could have a catastrophic effect
on the reputation of our intelligence services.
The fact that he had gone undetected for so long,
which could, in turn, seriously affect our relationship with the Americans.
We're on our last reserves of goodwill with them as it is.
One more operational failure,
and our credibility would be completely shot.
What are they suggesting?
That we turn a blind eye and allow a traitor,
an enemy of this country, to remain free, with his career and reputation intact,
just to spare MI5's blushes?
- The man should be shot. - I agree.
But instead, I have to get up and pay tribute to him at this exhibition.
How am I supposed to get through my speech?
I might choke on my words.
We stand here tonight,
surrounded by some of the Royal Collection's greatest treasures,
to admire the genius of Rubens, Titian, Rembrandt, and Holbein,
but that we are able to make sense of it all,
appreciate it, understand it...
speaks to the genius of another man,
whose exceptional scholarship and vision have brought us together today.
Sir Anthony Blunt.
Thank you.
It is he who has curated this exhibition,
and given meaning to mystery,
and revealed what really does lie beneath the surface.
I, for one, had never thought of art history in that way,
as the art of investigation,
solving riddles, finding clues,
unlocking secrets.
It's been quite an education.
I particularly enjoyed the portrait
which turned out to have another person lurking beneath the surface.
Have I described that correctly, Sir Anthony?
Or am I stumbling around in the dark, as usual?
Not another person, ma'am. The same person.
It was not uncommon in the early modern period
for an artist to finish a portrait,
and the patron would take a look
and ask for a more flattering version of themselves.
And the artist would paint another version over it.
So, not two different people?
Two different versions of the same person.
Which might as well be two different people.
The idealized version of themselves they want to be seen,
and the less desirable person they really are, hidden away.
There's even a word for it: "palimpsest."
That generally applies to manuscripts, ma'am.
"Pentimento" for paintings.
Pentimento.
Well, I think I speak for everyone here
when I say none of us will be able to trust
or look at anything in the same way ever again.
Prime Minister.
Your Majesty.
I'm so glad you came.
It gives me the chance to apologize in person.
- What for? - There's no need to understand.
All you need to know is that I misjudged you terribly,
and I'd like to take this opportunity to say sorry.
Are you an art man?
- Art? - Yes, art. Paintings.
Well, actually, no. No. Uh...
I'm an economist, a statistician at heart.
I'm happiest with numbers.
You can trust numbers.
They're honest.
There's no mystery
or deception or allegory.
You know where you stand.
What you see is what you get.
And I prefer things that way.
I quite agree.
His Royal Highness would like to see you, sir.
Excuse me a moment.
The very least you could do is quietly crawl away,
not force us to live with you under the same roof.
But doing the... the right thing,
the decent thing, the honorable thing...
you wouldn't have the faintest idea what that was.
Well, I am going to be watching you,
and one wrong step, you treacherous snake,
and I will expose you and have you thrown in jail.
I would think long and hard before I did that, sir.
You would do well to reflect on your own position.
What are you talking about?
You may remember, at the height of the Profumo sex scandal,
there was talk of a member of the royal family being involved.
No one knew who,
but it was rumored to be a senior member of the royal family.
Very senior.
When the osteopath at the center of the scandal, Stephen Ward,
took his own life...
there was speculation that a number of portraits
of that senior member of the royal family had been found in his apartment.
Naturally, a great many people were keen to get their hands on those portraits.
Mercifully, someone respected and well connected in the art world...
was able to make sure they didn't fall into the wrong hands.
I never saw Stephen Ward in any capacity other than as an osteopath.
If he made drawings of me, he would have done so from photographs.
We all tell ourselves all sorts of things
to make sense of the past.
So much so that our fabrications,
if we tell them to ourselves often enough,
become the truth.
In our minds and everyone else's.
And believe you me, I'm happy for your truth to be the truth.
It would be better for everyone.
Imagine how awful it would be, for example,
if those pictures saw the light of day now.
The storm it would create.
And for what?
It's the past.
- Would you excuse me? - Of course, Your Majesty.
As His Majesty the King has not yet produced a male successor,
nor do we at this stage expect one,
the decision has been taken to start preparing you in earnest for the Crown.
From this moment on,
you will no longer be the heir presumptive,
but the heir apparent, and your life will be quite different.
You will not be able to travel unaccompanied,
nor to socialize as freely.
Your father, the King, had little or no time to prepare for the throne,
which was thrust upon him.
We will not be caught out again.
The Crown is not just an ornament to be worn.
It is a privilege and a burden,
which comes with formidable expectations and responsibilities.
I don't think I can do it.
I could.
I know you could.
I'd love every minute.
To be on every coin, on every banknote,
to be the most famous woman in the world.
I'd be so very good at it.
Wearing a big crown, giving everyone orders.
Yes.
Then tell them,
"Margaret Rose can do it.
Margaret Rose wants to do it.
Margaret Rose was born to do it."
You were.
Then let me speak to them tomorrow.
It would be the best thing for both of us.
All right.
Good.
Hello, you.
Your Majesty.
Just come to wish you a bon voyage and to thank you.
What for?
For agreeing to squeeze in so many public engagements
on what is essentially a private trip.
- And for flying this way, commercially. - Well, it's not so bad.
They've cleared out the first-class cabin just for us.
What's the first stop? New York?
Uh, San Francisco. Then Los Angeles.
Then five days with the Douglases in Arizona.
How lovely.
Then on to New York, where Tony is promoting his book.
- You've written a book? - Uh, a book of my photographs.
Oh, you are clever.
You must make time to really relax, too.
We will.
Be good to one another. Kind to one another.
Both of you.
Sad she felt the need to say that.
What?
"Be good to one another. Kind to one another. Both of you."
It was a little clumsy.
But she means well.
The two of us...
we're complicated.
She and I are complicated.
It's true.
Elder sister, younger sister.
Number one and number two.
Who's number one?
You. Of course.
A natural number one whose tragedy it is to have been born number two.
Hmm. That is my burden.
She knows it, too.
Yes, I think she does.
That's her burden.
Good morning, Mr. Ambassador.
Economically, as you know, Marvin,
the United Kingdom is right up against it.
It's seeing a terrifying run on sterling,
and our credit from the IMF is about to expire.
Now, the Prime Minister has made several attempts
to speak to the President about another bailout,
a rescue package.
But the President refuses to take his call.
President Johnson is a busy man.
Too busy to talk to his oldest ally?
Historically, the holder of this office
has the warmest relationship with Downing Street.
Think of Churchill and Roosevelt,
or Truman and Attlee. Macmillan and JFK.
No need to keep mentioning Jack Kennedy like that.
Keep mentioning?
It's just provocative.
Unhelpful.
President Johnson is his own man.
Well, of course.
I mentioned it only in the context of our leaders
standing shoulder to shoulder in times of difficulty.
Morning, Prime Minister.
The United Kingdom and the United States.
Historically, it's like a marriage.
Will you talk to him?
No! Screw the Brits! I don't like 'em. I never liked 'em.
If they're not looking down at you through their noses,
they're holding their hands out like beggars.
And I don't give a crap about any special relationship.
Harold Wilson wants my help, he should have thought about that
when he refused to support me over Vietnam.
You can't screw a man in the ass and then expect him to buy you flowers!
- The Prime Minister, Your Majesty. - Your Majesty.
Prime Minister.
Uh, I'm sure that it did not escape your attention
that President Johnson failed to attend Mr. Winston's funeral.
Yes, on account of a cold.
Well, that was the explanation the White House gave,
but it persuaded no one.
Uh... I fear that the President may have taken against me
for what he sees as my failure to support him over Vietnam.
And I wondered...
...in the past,
the royal family has been extremely helpful
in keeping the special relationship afloat.
And given the...
predicament the country finds itself in economically...
You'd like us to roll out the red carpet. Make a bit of a fuss.
Please.
All right.
I shall consult the Three Wise Men. See what they have to say.
Thank you, ma'am.
Welcome to San Francisco!
Margaret! Margaret, over here! Over here!
Picture, right this way! Thank you, Margaret.
"What we have witnessed in Princess Margaret
is a more vibrant, modern, and engaging version of her older sister."
Quite right.
"To those accustomed to the formality of traditional royal visits,
meeting Princess Margaret has been like going from a black-and-white film
to one in color."
What about a state dinner,
like the one held for Woodrow Wilson in 1918?
Or a weekend at Windsor Castle?
The important thing here, I'm told,
is that whatever we offer President Johnson,
it must exceed whatever we gave the Kennedys.
Hey, we wanted to see the Queen!
You're seeing something better than the Queen!
What do you think is the main difference between Britain and America?
Well, my sister isn't on the banknotes here!
What are you most looking forward to in America?
Liberty!
We love you, Princess Margaret!
Smiles with you
Keep smiling, darling.
What news of Princess Margaret?
After three days in San Francisco,
Her Royal Highness has safely arrived in Los Angeles.
Any disasters I should be aware of?
No, on the contrary, the trip seems to have been a great success.
Really?
There's rave reviews in all the newspapers...
...with even a name having been coined for the multitude of fans and well-wishers
who have followed her every step of the way.
- Which is? - Margaretologists.
Margaretologists?
Yes, ma'am.
Fans who have delighted
in Her Royal Highness's intelligence and articulacy, her beauty
and charm, with one newspaper, The San Francisco Chronicle,
even going so far as...
- Yes, all right. Thank you, Martin. - Uh, yes, ma'am.
I'm a queen, not a saint.
That's it. Try not to smile.
I gave it!
Not once, not twice, but three times, and you ignored it!
What?
The signal!
Our signal that I wanted to leave.
I didn't see it.
You know as well as I that if you are the guest of honor,
you cannot just leave.
In the course of our marriage, I have lost count of the number of times
you've walked out as "guest of honor."
- Once or twice. - All the bloody time.
- When it's dreary. - When it suits you!
When the people are ugly and dull.
These people were amusing and attractive.
And they made me feel good.
No, no, no, no. The alcohol made you feel good...
and blunted your judgment
to the sycophancy of the people surrounding you.
Is that right?
- Yes. Keys. - Well...
sadly, it's not blunted my judgment
to your mean-spiritedness and jealousy and...
general pusillanimity...
pusinalamn...
Small-mindedness.
I don't recognize this.
Come to think of it, I don't recognize you.
Actually...
...nor did anyone else!
I mean, if we're honest...
...isn't that the real problem here, hmm?
Oh, I'm sorry.
A-A-And... and you are... Tony who?
Oh, yeah! The husband guy.
It's not easy, sometimes.
What is not easy?
Being second fiddle to a pygmy princess.
Don't talk to me about being a second fiddle.
I get so little limelight.
No, it's the price I pay for the sister I have.
But if the opportunity should once arise for me to shine,
I'd appreciate you putting aside the competitive little narcissist
that rages within you...
and letting me savor it.
I promise...
that once we get to New York,
the spotlight will be entirely on you,
and your book.
I'll take a back seat
and be the adoring and supportive number two
you want me to be.
And nothing will make me happier.
Now, you can tell me all you want that 50,000,
hell, 100,000 more boots on the ground are going to resolve this.
But I put 100,000 more men in there,
who's to say that Ho Chi Minh isn't gonna put 100,000 more?
A man can't fight if he can't see daylight at the end of the road.
I wanna see solutions, gentlemen, solutions.
Not more numbers!
By God, I will not be the first American president
to lose a goddamn war!
- That'll be all. - Yes, sir, Mr. President.
Thank you.
What is this?
A peace offering from the Brits, hoping to secure the bailout.
- A weekend shooting at Balmoral? - Yes, sir. That's as good as it gets.
Even Kennedy never got that.
Really?
He got a banquet, a Naval Guard of Honor, but never a weekend shooting in Scotland.
No one has gotten that.
Still...
that's a long flight,
followed by a long drive...
staying in some creepy haunted castle.
The weather's terrible.
And it would involve making small talk to fancy people.
Then when you go shooting,
there's rules, things you do and don't do,
which would involve research and learning...
cutting my nails...
and I'd still get it all wrong.
And then everybody would laugh at me and they'd say I wasn't no Jack Kennedy,
who would know exactly which knife and fork to use and which bird to shoot.
- So, my position has not changed. - Hmm.
It is still, "No, thank you, Your Majesty."
Tomorrow, there's the reception given by the Council of Engineering Institutions
at the Science Museum,
followed by an audience with His Excellency GuÃ°mundur GuÃ°mundsson,
the new ambassador for the Republic of Iceland.
Thank you, Michael. And where are we with President Johnson?
Ah, we went back offering a weekend shooting in Balmoral.
Did we? Lucky LBJ. We don't get enough of those ourselves.
- And? - No response, ma'am.
- What? - Nothing. Complete silence.
- That's a first. - Yes.
And probably not what Downing Street was hoping for.
- Is everyone panicking? - Slightly.
- What about Princess Margaret? - Oh, safely arrived in Arizona, ma'am.
Oh, well, that's something. At the Douglas family ranch?
- Yes. - I've never been.
- What do we know about it? - They say it's quite something.
A beautiful 19th-century country house set under the Santa Rita mountains,
in miles and miles of wide-open desert.
Tony!
- Tony. - Brace yourselves.
Come along, darling.
- Your Royal Highness. - Your Royal Highness.
No, Blinkie, no kissing. Germs!
She's exhausted, poor thing.
- I look hideous. - No.
Ghastly.
You look a bit tired.
A bit coldy.
It's only to be expected after your...
heroics.
You hated every minute, didn't you?
Maybe.
But that's irrelevant.
The newspapers didn't.
Page after page about how extraordinary you were,
what an asset to the Crown, how underused you are,
what a secret weapon, how deserving you are of the spotlight.
- Your elder sister eclipsed and outshone. - Darling.
- And now you must sleep. - Hmm? What will you do?
Be a good guest and sing for our supper.
- So rest. - I will.
And get well for New York.
Mr. President, I just got off the phone with our ambassador in London,
who just got off the phone with the Prime Minister,
- who got off the phone with the Queen. - Don't tell me, everybody's pissed.
The general view seems to be
that if you have a quarrel with the Prime Minister,
that's one thing, but no one gets to insult the Crown, sir.
It's like, uh, treason or something.
How have I insulted the Crown?
By not accepting the Queen's invitation, sir.
Well, I didn't refuse.
I just haven't replied.
Well, now, don't you do this, Marvin.
You're my Chief of Staff, you're supposed to have my back.
Don't you get suckered into this.
You know, they got this whole thing going on over there,
Head of State, Prime Minister, Buckingham Palace,
Downing Street, it's like a double act, like tag-team wrestling.
One of 'em gets in trouble, the other jumps in to bail 'em out.
Wilson screws me over Vietnam,
and she jumps in to make it all good with some bird-shoot bullshit.
We don't have that here.
No, sir.
The buck stops with me.
Who the hell am I supposed to call
if I want to issue an invitation to get me out of trouble?
Well, you call me, sir, your oldest friend.
I'd come up with a sensible plan to get us all out of trouble.
All right. Come up with a plan.
Well, sir, I just did.
This is the plan, right here.
Who in God's name is that?
They came to land at Oakland Airport,
and here, as in San Francisco,
crowds met and cheered them everywhere they went.
The Princess was radiant, obviously enjoying herself.
It wasn't long before her sparkle cast an informal atmosphere over the occasion.
The American people and their press have warmed to the couple,
enchanted by the natural display of charm and friendliness.
Prime Minister for you, ma'am.
Said it was urgent.
Prime Minister?
Just to say, we've finally had a response from the Americans, ma'am.
They've come back with an invitation of their own.
To dinner at the White House.
- For me? - No, for Princess Margaret.
- Oh, that's cunning. - Uh, yes.
That way, President Johnson can't be accused of snubbing my offer.
No.
It also side-steps the all-important issue of the bailout.
Indeed.
But we think not all is lost,
that Princess Margaret should accept the invitation,
go to the White House,
and use the occasion
to win over hearts and minds to the British cause.
It would be a political engagement of the utmost delicacy.
For which you want to send Princess Margaret?
Yes, well, that had been my reaction.
But her trip to America has been a terrific success.
So I gather.
So, will you ask her?
If those are my instructions.
Please.
Well, well.
I suppose the situation is so dire, there's really nothing to lose.
He doesn't know my sister.
Ma'am.
No!
- Your Royal Highness? - No!
- Telephone for you. - No!
It's the Queen.
Hello, you.
Hello, you.
Sorry to disturb.
I know you're on holiday, so you won't want to hear this.
What?
We've had an invitation from the White House
for you to go to Washington
and have dinner with the President and the First Lady,
and we'd like you to attend.
- When? - This Wednesday.
Oh. Can't.
Why not?
I'm going to be in New York.
For Tony's book launch.
Perhaps I should make it clear.
There is rather a lot riding on it,
and everyone is keen, very keen, for you to go.
Perhaps I should make it clear
that nothing is going to stop me from supporting my husband,
just like you asked me to.
Margaret!
"Dear Margaret,
as a wife, I understand your desire to support Tony.
You know that it was my honest hope
that on this trip you would both find the opportunity
to be more courteous,
more encouraging to each other.
But for now, such considerations must be put aside.
I have asked you this once as a sister,
and now I must command it as your Queen."
Your Royal Highness. Sir. Thank you so much for agreeing to this.
The most recent list of people attending the dinner,
with some brief biographies of those expected to sit close to you.
"What I'm asking you to do
amounts to much more than simply attending a dinner.
Currently, there are matters pertaining to this country's future prosperity
that require a concerted effort on our part.
We must heal the divisions that are emerging
between Britain and its American cousins.
You've often lamented that you have nothing to do,
that you are a wasted resource.
Well, the task you are embarking on today could not be more crucial.
Britain currently has a deficit of £800 million.
What we need is a bailout of at least £1,000 million.
Only the Americans can give it to us.
I know you like to do things your own way.
But this is a diplomatic mission of the highest sensitivity.
And I would urge you, for once,
to play things by the book."
Ready?
What happens if I fail?
If we don't get the bailout?
Then we break our promises to the IMF,
exhaust the credit facilities available to us,
face a run on sterling,
and the government would be left with no option but to devalue the pound.
Hm-hmm. And that's bad?
Devaluation?
It's worse than bad.
It would relegate sterling to the second division of the world's currencies
and Britain to the third division of the world's economies.
It would mean international humiliation, political ignominy, and...
financial ruin.
Your Royal Highness.
President Johnson.
- Good morning, Prime Minister. - Good morning.
I've had an opportunity now
to speak to our ambassador in Washington about the White House dinner last night.
And?
I...
I don't know where to begin.
It seemed the first course had barely been served
before Princess Margaret made remarks about the late President Kennedy
that were...
less than discreet.
I met him once. Kennedy.
I was left distinctly...
underwhelmed.
Margaret.
I'm sorry. Did I say something wrong?
I do know these days one's not allowed
to think anything other than what a great statesman Kennedy was.
- Say nothing, Lyndon. - Of course he'll say nothing.
He was his loyal deputy.
Which I think I can understand better than most.
The frustrations and resentments that can build up
from a life as a number two.
The support act.
Even of someone you adore.
You spent three years as Vice President.
I've spent my whole life as Vice Queen.
Except that came out wrong, I didn't mean I'm a... "vice queen."
Is there a strategy in place to deal with the fallout?
Oh, no. There's no fallout.
What?
President Johnson agreed. Thoroughly. Enthusiastically.
Unreservedly.
He said, um, if I remember rightly,
"Jack Kennedy..."
...would've killed his own mother
just to take the skin off her ass to make a drum to beat his own praises.
Right?
I see.
This then led to a drinking contest.
- What? - Last man standing
- is the winner. - Challenge accepted!
Which, in turn, led to a limerick contest.
- Limericks? - Yes, ma'am.
Some of them, I'm afraid to say, a little off-color.
Well, go on then.
Oh, right... Um...
Well, the first one went a little...
"There was a young woman from Delaware..."
Who liked to make love...
liked to make love...
- Delaware! Delaware! - ...in her underwear.
- A terrible prude... - "She would never go nude,
And her bum, hips, and tits she would never bare."
What else?
The President countered with,
"There was a young man from Wisconsin
Who was blessed with an enormously large..."
...Johnson!
Where's the rest of it?
I believe everyone thought that was long enough. As it were.
Any more?
Princess Margaret won the evening with this one...
"There was a young lady from Dallas,
Who used a dynamite stick as a phallus..."
They found her...
You've made it this far.
"They found her vagina in North Carolina..."
And her arsehole in Buckingham Palace.
Bravo.
Then, apparently, there was dancing.
Followed by singing.
Anything you can be, I can be greater
Sooner or later, I'm greater than you
- No, you're not - Yes, I am
- No, you're not - Yes, I am
- No, you're not - Yes, I am, yes, I am
She staggered home at four in the morning,
newly Anglophile President Johnson having agreed to the bailout,
the special relationship more special than ever.
- Without being caught? - Yeah
That's what I thought, you crook
And all because Margaret was all the things
I'd specifically begged her not to be.
All the things I could never be.
Instinctive, spontaneous, dazzling.
Yes, I can
- You're all those things, too. - No, I'm not.
I'm predictable, dependable, reliable.
Well, of those two,
I would pick dependability every day of the week.
Thank you.
But it would be nice to be dazzling on occasion, too.
- You are dazzling. - Hmm.
You're a dazzling cabbage.
Anything you can say, I can say faster
I can say anything faster than you
- No, you can't - Yes, I can
- No, you can't - Yes, I can
- No, you can't - Yes, I can
Prime Minister.
Well played, Your Royal Highness.
Very well played.
Thank you, sir.
Shall we?
- Hail the conquering heroine! - Ah, yes.
Let the abuse begin.
Now, you must know by now
any triumph from this family is met with a healthy dose of...
- Envy? Spite? - Good-natured teasing
to keep one's feet on the ground.
Everyone's very grateful.
The Prime Minister said he was going to write to you personally.
Better than that. He met me at the airport.
And now we're all racking our brains
as to what to give you to show our appreciation.
How would you feel about the Order of Merit?
Or the Victorian Chain?
You can keep your gongs and your bongs
for all the men to whom it matters so much.
But I'd be lying if I didn't admit to having done a little thinking,
in view of how well it all went...
about us doing it more often.
Doing what?
Sharing duties.
But we didn't share duties. You just went to a dinner party.
In your place.
And represented Crown and country
with, I think we can agree, favorable results.
Isn't it possible that we've stumbled upon something here?
You have far too much to do, far too much pressure,
far too much responsibility.
And I, too little.
Having no role, having nothing to do is...
soul-destroying.
All I am asking is if you were prepared to share a little more.
For both our sakes.
Let me think about it.
I'll see what I can do.
- Don't tell me you softened? - I did.
And with good reason.
Margaret does suffer more than anyone else by not having a more meaningful role.
Suffers in health and happiness.
She's overlooked.
And in terms of ability and character
and intelligence and flair, she does not deserve to be overlooked.
So, why shouldn't we consider expanding the role,
sharing the job a bit more?
There are two answers to that question.
Neither makes for pretty listening.
Yes, the system is unequal and unjust and cruel.
Primogeniture divides and destroys families,
the system stinks, but...
in its cruelty and injustice, it reflects something else,
which is harsh and brutal,
which no one is suggesting we rearrange.
Life.
We all desire equality, but here's the thing.
We were not born equal.
And what's the second?
Do you remember I told you once
I got drunk with that god-awful monster Tommy Lascelles?
Well, that night he shared with me his theory
about the House of Windsor.
I've never repeated it to anyone since.
Go on.
He asked me to imagine a mythological creature.
A Reichsadler.
A polycephalus, a two-headed eagle.
For the purposes of this conversation,
I want you to think of it as representing us.
This family.
Your family.
There have always been the dazzling Windsors and the dull ones.
- Your father... - A saint.
But dull. Sorry.
Your grandfather, too.
- George V? - Deadly dull.
At the height of the Great War, when the...
the Tsar and the Kaiser and the Emperor of Austria
were dazzling the world, where was he?
He was sticking stamps in his album.
- His wife... - Queen Mary, wonderful.
Ditchwater.
And so it goes, through George V to Queen Victoria and back.
An uninterrupted line of stolid,
turgid dreariness.
Culminating in me?
Well, yes, but...
alongside that dull, dutiful, reliable, heroic strain
runs another.
The dazzling, the brilliant, the individualistic,
and... the dangerous.
And so, for every Victoria, you get an Edward VII.
For every George V, you get a Prince Eddy.
For every George VI, you get an Edward VIII.
For every Lilibet...
you get a Margaret.
And she may have had a success in Washington,
but let's not delude ourselves that serious diplomacy can be achieved
through drinking and dancing.
Let Margaret have the glory,
but let's not rewrite the constitutional rulebook
because she got lucky once.
And where does that leave my relationship with her?
Unchanged.
You're the Queen.
And she's your dangerous baby sister.
She's outside. She knows we're talking about her.
Then let's join her.
That feverish mind of hers needs no encouragement.
What you are suggesting is unthinkable.
The order of succession to the throne is determined
by the Act of Settlement of 1701,
not the wild and irresponsible whims
of young princesses.
The principle of undisturbed hereditary descent is a pillar
of stability and perpetuity for the nation.
Princess Elizabeth's destiny is to accede to the throne.
Yours is to serve and support.
I would urge you to accept your position in life...
and to dismiss forthwith any childish notions
about rewriting the rule books that it might better suit your character.
We all have a role to play.
Princess Elizabeth's will be center-stage,
and yours, ma'am, will be from the wings.
Margaret!
Why are the English still with us?
Why, after everything we've thrown at them,
does the British presence in Ireland still endure?
So many sacrifices have been made.
So many of our brothers and sisters
have given their lives in resistance to that occupation,
but we are still ignored.
WeÂ are still denied our basic right to self determination,
and our sons and brothers, husbands and fathers
are still held in British jails.
Well, if nothing has changed,
then, my friends, it is time for a new approach.
Eyes right!
That is why our leadership has issued a new directive.
This is from the very top.
Today, the Irish Republican struggle for freedom
enters a new phase.
The time has come to escalate our efforts
redouble our militancy Eyes right!
spill more blood,
so that the Crown retreats and leaves Ireland forever.
No Charles? He didn't stay for lunch?
Couldn't wait to get away. I heard he doesn't eat lunch anymore.
Whyever not? How queer. Perhaps he wants to keep his figure.
How is he, Dickie? He talks more to you than to anyone.
Well, I'm afraid it's now clear the navy is not for him.
I wasn't talking about his career. She means matters of the heart.
He comes to you with all of that.
We read about it in the newspapers like everyone else.
This Westmorland girl I've been reading about, in or out?
No, she's out. Oh.
There was a Guinness.
She's gone too.
And one in a bathing costume.
Caroline Longman. With the whip?
Not a whip. Whiplash.
No, that was Anna Wallace. Heck of a horsewoman.
No, she broke it off with him.
And at one point, was there even a Borgia?
Yes. Christabel.
Was she a serious contender, with that name?
From what I gather, the latest is, um
Sarah Spencer.
Johnny's girl?
His eldest, yes. Oh, I rather like that idea.
We all do. She's fun, she's clever
And unlike a certain Mrs. Parker Bowles,
she's not married.
He's not still seeing her, surely?
After all the lengths we went to.
Well, we can't be surprised.
He was following the advice he was given, wasn't he, Dickie?
You were the one who encouraged it.
Telling him to sow his oats, play the field?
No thought for his duty?
Well, all the more reason to cheer for Sarah.
Your Royal Highness.
I thought we'd ride out.
There's a lovely lodge the other side of High Wood we can go to
where we can be alone.
Your Royal Highness. Ma'am, telephone for you. Mr.Â O'Keefe.
Oh. That's the estate office with the key to the lodge.
Can I leave you here for a minute, sir? Yes.
Sorry. I'm not here.
I was given strict instructions to remain out of sight,
but I have to get to that room over there, and this is the only way.
Your Royal Highness.
Well, I haven't seen a thing.
Thank you, sir.
It's quite a costume.
Is it a complete disaster?
We're doing A Midsummer Night's Dream at school.
I love Midsummer Night's Dream.
So do I.
All the characters have such wonderful names.
Flute, Snout, Goodfellow..
Snug, Quince
Bottom!
Yes, Bottom.
They gave that part to a girl called Francesca Lamont,
who also happens to have the most enormous backside.
She took it personally.
She's had a bit of a nervous breakdown.
I'm Sarah's younger sister, by the way.
Please don't tell her you saw me. I'll get into terrible trouble.
She wanted everything to be just perfect. She wouldn't want me to scare you off.
How would you do that?
Well, you know
by being a mad tree.
I won't say a thing.
Thank you, sir.
Keys. Got them.
Right. Ready?
Ready.
Is everything all right?
Yes. I just met your younger sister.
Did you?
That's sneaky of her.
I told her to leave us alone. She was just passing through.
Well, she could have gone on the outside,
but she was obsessed with the idea of meeting you.
Was she? Obsessed.
The last opinion poll, published just over anÂ hour ago,
gives the Tories a 16% lead
wonderful day. First of all for Britain
TUC concordat was now a dead document, though that didn't mean
It is her grit and remarkable stamina
that has kept her center stage throughout this election.
Mrs . Thatcher believes
We are very... We are very confident.
a period where people get hurt
woman with a mission.
She believesÂ the people of Britain will help to accomplish it.
We are very confident.
or 21%
Mrs. Thatcher, are you feeling confident? Are you gonna win today, Mrs. Thatcher?
I will not be drawn on any subject save the weather.
It's a lovely day.
It's looking like a comfortable victory for the Conservative Party
and the prospect of our first ever woman prime minister.
What do we know about Margaret Thatcher? That's the last thing this country needs.
What? Two women running the shop.
Perhaps that's precisely what this country needs.
I rather like what I've seen of her. What, the shopkeeper's daughter?
An alderman shopkeeper's daughter
who worked hard and gained a scholarship to Oxford.
Yes, to study chemistry.
Yes, but later changed direction and qualified as a barrister
while raising twins. You try doing that.
What about her character?
It says here,
"As a young woman, she applied for a job as a food research chemist
and was rejected after the personnel department assessed her
as being headstrong, obstinate, and dangerously self opinionated."
Really? Who else around here does that sound like?
You must be hopeful. The polls show you comfortably ahead.
We never count our chickens before they're hatched,
and we don't count number 10 Downing Street
before it's Thatched.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
What we're seeing now is history in the making.
Britain's first woman prime minister,
a conviction politician who's made no secret of the fact
she believes the country has to change from top to bottom,
going to the palace,
presumably to tell her queen exactly that.
Mr. and Mrs. Thatcher, follow me, please.
The leader of the opposition, Your Majesty.
Mrs. Thatcher.
Your Majesty.
Your party has won the election.
It is my very great pleasure to invite you to form a government in my name.
Congratulations, Prime Minister.
Thank you, ma'am.
Please.
Your family must be very proud. You've two children?
Yes, but grown up now and out of the house.
And your husband is retired. Is that right?
Yes, but he won't get in the way,
if that's what you're asking.
Denis is very good at taking care of himself.
His golf clubs will be in the hallway. He will come and go as he pleases.
He knows how busy I will be, and how hard I intend to work.
To business then.
Have you decided on your first Cabinet?
I have.
It may surprise you
that I enjoy predicting ministerial comings and goings.
It is like the races.
I like to study form and odds.
Who's in. Who's out.
I also like to predict cabinets.
My best so far was Mr. Wilson's second reshuffle.
I got 90%.
Would you like to hear my predictions for yours?
I'm assuming no women.
Women?
In cabinet.
Oh, certainly not.
Well, not just because there aren't any suitable candidates,
but I have found women in general tend not to be suited to high office.
Oh? Why's that?
Well, they become too emotional.
I doubt you'll have that trouble with me.
Mm. Now,
Willie Whitelaw. Home Office?
Yes.
Tick.
Geoffrey Howe. Treasury? Yes.
Tick.
Hailsham. Lord chancellor?
Yes.
Walker, Heseltine, Biffen, Prior
She got most of them right.
She didn't guess St. John Stevas as minister for the arts,
but that's only because she'd already correctly picked him
for the leader of the House.
Smart cookie! Yes. Quite different to how I imagined.
More interested and informed.
With a commendable appetite for work,
which I'm told she keeps up throughout the summer holidays.
I left thinking we might work very well together.
Two menopausal women. That'll be a smooth ride.
I heard that.
I don't mean to put extra stress on you. To be that tacky It's disgusting.
It's certainly lovely to be back. Thank you.
You going stalking with the boss?
She insisted.
Good.
Obviously, your life is your own business,
and your career as a show jumper is your own business too,
but I heard you're thinking of withdrawing from competition.
Is, uh is that true?
Yes. I've had such a bad run recently.
With Badminton coming up and a chance for Olympic competition?
I know, but Mark has decided to compete himself this year
and that would mean us training together, being on the circuit together.
I see.
Is that such a bad thing?
He is your husband.
Just about.
We were
We were all so proud, having an actual Olympian in the family.
An Olympian who's spent much of the past year on her backside.
Oh, come on.
This isn't like you. Hmm.
Remind me. What is "like me"?
I seem not to just have forgotten how to ride, but who I am.
Well, then let me remind you.
You are the most
brilliant
resilient, most
determined young woman that I know.
With a nasty dose of the horrors when she sits on a horse.
They will go again
with work, with determination
and a Battenberg refusal to give in.
Thank you.
Ready?
Good luck. Yes.
Won't be too hard to find with the weather so still.
Yes, you're right. Good morning.
Dry as well. Come on, girl.
Ready? Thank you.
Sir?
Telephone for you.
Hello? Dear boy!
My office rang Buckingham Palace what must be an hour ago,
and I've been put through to about nine different extensions.
Where have we reached you?
Northeast Iceland,
in a lodge on the RiverÂ HofsÃ¡.
What are you doing there?
Salmon fishing with friends.
Are you at Classiebawn with the gang?
The whole tribe,
and everyone's asking after you.
Are you gonna be in London next week? I'd like to see you.
I won't. I have a rendezvous with Camilla.
We've found a couple of days where we could catch up.
Oh, Charles, you're not still seeing her?
You know what the family thinks.
Yes, I'm perfectly aware of what the family thinks.
And what I think too?
Yes, and the richness of that is not lost on me either.
That you, of all people, should lecture me about the sanctity of marriage,
affairs of the heart needing to be conventional ,
because you and Edwina hardly blazed a trail in that department.
At least when Camilla and I commit adultery,
there aren't national security implications involved.
That was uncalled for.
So is your unwelcome intervention in this matter.
Honestly, you make a great show of being my ally in this family,
watching my back,
but when the chips are down, you're just a quisling.
A fifth columnist playing for the other side.
The fact is, I haven't met anyone I like as much as Camilla,
who is trapped in a marriage of your engineering
with a husband who's bedding half of Gloucestershire.
Invite us both to Broadlands soon. You'll see how happy we make one another.
That is, if my happiness is even remotely important to you.
Now I must go.
Come on, Daddy! Look at the time!
Nicholas! Timothy!
All right. Get this to the Prince of Wales as soon as possible.
Sir.
Right.
Time to catch some lobster. Hmm?
Let's go.
Where did you see him?
Just up there, on the brow. Can you see?
Okay.
In case you're feeling a little chilled. Here you are, Paul.
Ahead!
Ahead!
That's the one.
No. No, not like that. You'll fall overboard.
Use the hook.
Thank you, Grandpapa. There you go.
Come on. There we are.
Need a bit more muscle.
Hold her behind the claws, so they can't nip you. Ugh
This is what we call a berried hen.
We're gonna throw this one back, then she can have her babies in peace.
And one,
two, and
Damn!
Stay on the radio!
Oh dear.
It's never good when they come in packs like this.
Your Majesty.
We've received a copy of a telegram
sent to the Foreign Office from the British embassy
in Dublin.
It reads
"At 13:05, the British ambassador was informed
that there had been an explosion
on Lord Mountbatten's boat in County Sligo."
Lord Mountbatten is dead.
As are the boat boy, Paul Maxwell, and Lord Mountbatten's grandson Nicholas.
Lord and Lady Brabourne, Doreen Lady Brabourne,
and Timothy Knatchbull are in hospital
in Sligo.
The IRA has, I'm afraid, already claimed responsibility.
It's looking like the 5th, sir.
For the funeral.
At Westminster Abbey.
I was asked to give you this.
Thank you.
My dear Charles,
there exists no greater compliment
than to be called a "prince among men."
Such a person earns his title
with his ability to lead and inspire
elusive virtues, to which you must reach and rise.
And it grieves me to say that you are not working hard enough
to reach and to rise.
The choice of a woman was the issue
around which the last Prince of Wales came to grief.
And it's astonishing to me that,
40 years after the abdication,
you are making so little attempt
to conceal your infatuation for another man's wife.
How could you contemplate such ruin and disappointment to yourself,
to your family,
to me?
Must I remind you again of the importance of building your destiny
with some sweet and innocent, well tempered girl
with no past,
who knows the rules
and will follow the rules?
Someone with whom you can make a fresh start
and build a new life.
One that people will love as a princess
and, in due course, as queen.
This is your duty now,
your most important task.
You are more than a man,
more than a prince,
and one day, dear boy, you shall be king.
But now, to the sea.
I miss you enormously.
There is no one whose company I enjoy more.
But I think you know that.
Your ever loving honorary grandpa
Dickie.
Yes? Buckingham Palace, Prime Minister.
Putting you through to Her Majesty the Queen.
Your Majesty. Prime Minister.
This is a very great tragedy.
Lord Mountbatten's death leaves a gap that can never be filled.
Our heartfelt condolences go out to you and your family,
and of course of those of the servicemen killed at Warrenpoint today.
I am sick and tired of those who would seek to rationalize
and make excuses for the atrocities committed by the IRA.
There's no such thing as political murder
or political bombing or political violence.
There's only criminal murder,
criminal bombing, and criminal violence.
And I give you my word,
I will wage a war against the Irish Republican Army
with relentless determination and without mercy
until that war is won.
Oh, it's you.
Yes.
It's a terrible thing.
But
he would have had no fear of death.
None. No.
And he would have hated any mawkish outpourings of grief.
Or sentimentality.
He left
500 pages of instructions.
For the funeral.
And chose you
to do the reading.
You.
Architecturally, there is little that is normal about this family.
Dickie's position within it twisted it even further
out of shape.
I barely knew my own father.
Dickie understood that and stepped in as a surrogate.
Which meant the world to me.
Then years later
maybe when he saw the
the struggles between the two of us
he switched horses and started caring for you.
I was no longer the priority.
He replaced me
as father to you.
And you
you replaced me as son to him.
I don't mind admitting there were times where that
transference of Dickie's affection,
of his care,
of his love
it might have given rise in me to a resentment.
Of me?
Not your fault, of course.
And
When one was as deprived of a father as I was,
one can't help feeling
I don't know
territorial of the next best thing
which Dickie was.
To us both.
What are you talking about?
You have a father.
You have a father.
I'd be happy to stand aside, Papa, really.
Then you can do the reading.
It's irrelevant
what I want or think.
It's what matters to Dickie.
And he chose you.
This morning, the Irish Republican Army
released a statement taking full responsibility
for the execution of Lord Mountbatten
and for the deaths of the 18 British servicemen
killed in our attacks at Warrenpoint.
"Thirteen gone and not forgotten. We got 18 and Mountbatten."
To Irish Republicans,
Lord Mountbatten was the ultimate symbol of imperialist oppression.
Each year, he came to sit in his castle
on land stolen by the English. He knew the risks in coming here.
And his death represents a legitimate blow against an enemy target.
Over the coming weeks and months, you will all bear witness
to the cloying tributes paid to this so called hero.
But where are the tears of the British government
for those men, women, and children of Ireland who've lost their lives?
Where is their grand funeral
or solemn state occasion?
Who will eulogize their deaths
or pay tribute to the lives
of the many Irish citizens so cruelly cut short,
like the 13 innocent civilians murdered by the British on Bloody Sunday?
"Thirteen gone, not forgotten. We got 18 and Mountbatten."
"They that go down to the sea in ships "
This is war.
" and occupy "
There will be casualties.
But while the British Crown remains in Ireland,
whatever blood is shed will be on their hands.
"He maketh the storm to cease
so that the waves thereof
are still."
" Then are they glad
because they are at rest. "
"And so he bringeth them unto the haven
where they would be."
Five minutes, Your Royal Highness.
this last stage of the three day event here at Badminton.
Lucinda Prior Palmer,
well, she'll be looking to break some records today
with a fourth win here on yet another horse,
Killaire, on whom she finished third two years ago.
She'll be jumping last.
But next into the arena
is Her Royal Highness Princess Anne riding Goodwill.
Timekeeper ready? Ready.
After an average dressage test and run out,
the princess will need to jump clear
Here she comes. Come on! Ah, yes.
inside time in order to qualify.
Good luck. Ready?
I am.
Her Royal Highness coming back from some career difficulties last year.
Just looking a little sticky coming up to this first fence here.
These fences, a maximum height of 3 ft. 11 in.
Go on! Lovely.
Well done, keep it together. Steady.
That's it. Yes.
Clears that one nicely, then a tight turn
Well done.
coming into the next fence.
Coming up nicely.
Come on! Don't shout.
Takes it well. Clear.
Fifteen seconds gone.
Clear. Wow!
Almost four faults there. Lovely.
The princess so nearly coming unstuck,
but it holds up,Â as she heads towards the final combination.
This is a big double, and she seems to be coming in short.
No, she's done it! Yes! Come on.
How are we doing? She needs to pick it up.
Nearly there. Come on, Anne.
As she heads towards the final fence
Yes! Oh!
She's done it, Princess Anne.
Those four inside time.
That is a fantastic effort
Brilliant! from Her Royal Highness,
who finishes overall in sixth place, and that should be enough.
Wonderful.
We must congratulate her. You go.
You missed it. No, I saw the last bit.
Mummy. What are you doing here?
I thought an extra pair of lungs to cheer Anne on couldn't hurt.
Except I doubt she'd have heard.
Your father was making such a noise. Was he?
Beside himself.
I'm so happy Anne can give him that.
It's really the best possible tonic for him.
We could all do with cheering up. Yes.
All one can think of is Dickie.
That's it. Follow the road round.
Here on the left, sir. Thanks very much, sir.
Your Royal Highness.
I just wanted to offer my condolences.
It must have been completely devastating for you.
And your reading at the Abbey,
how you held it all together under the circs,
I don't know how you did that.
It was utterly brilliant. Thank you.
I'm sorry. We haven't met.
We have.
I was in costume at the time.
Sarah Spencer's younger sister.
Oh. The mad tree!
Diana.
Yes. Yes.
Sarah told me how close you were to Lord Mountbatten,
that he was like a father to you.
Yes.
It must all be unimaginably awful.
Thank you.
It has been.
Come on!
I just wanted to say you're very much in my thoughts.
All our thoughts.
Sir.
Oh, come on!
Hello? Sarah.
Your Royal Highness! That's a nice surprise.
First things first. I'm afraid I won't be able to come to your wedding.
But congratulations to you and, uh
Neil.
Thank you, sir. Now
your sister, Diana
Yes?
Tell me about her. What would you like to know?
Everything.
I'm not sure you want to know everything.
Maybe I do.
All right. She works part time at a kindergarten.
She's a teacher? No.
For that, you'd need actual qualifications.
More of a helper out.
She's only just turned 18, you know.
She also cleans for me.
Part time. As in
Like a cleaning lady.
You want more?
A little more.
Is she fun?
She can be great fun.
And I'm sure all the kids love her.
I'm sure all the kids' dads love her too.
Really?
What about her character?
Everyone in the family calls her "Duch," because ever since childhood,
she's behavedÂ as if she were destined for greater things.
Oh dear. Have I just put you off?
No.
You've rather intrigued me now.
Would you mind if I asked her out?
Out out? Yes.
Gosh.
Would you mind? No.
Should I warn her?
No.
Let it be a surprise.
I might need her telephone number first.
Of course. It's
It's
01373
Di? Di?
Diana?
It's the Prince of Wales.
Hello?
Your Royal Highness.
Allow a little bit for the wind, sir.
It's just off to the left.
Adjust the sight to 100 yards.
And we release the lock
And gently squeeze the trigger.
Is dead?
No.
You hit him, sir, but that's him away now, wounded.
So we go after him. No. No, no.
See that wee stream down there?
That is the border where our estate ends and our neighbor's estate begins.
And we never cross that line, ever.
Morning, Your Majesty. Morning.
Just to say that the prime minister
and Mr. Thatcher are expected to arrive at around 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.
Thank you.
What's all the excitement? Morning, Mummy.
Good morning. Morning, Mummy.
Morning. Are you going to tell her or am I?
Go on. I can see you're bursting to.
Our head gamekeeper had a telephone call this morning from the neighboring estate.
It seems one of their commercial guests
Japanese, apparently.
shot and wounded a grand stag,
which has now crossed over onto Crown land and needs...
Needs finishing off on compassionate grounds.
Am I telling this or are you? Well, get on with it, then.
Anyway.
It's an imperial, apparently.
Fourteen points. Really?
Hence the excitement,
hence us changing all our plans so that we can get out there today.
But we have engagements. Not anymore.
I've canceled everything. What?
Come on, Mummy.
We all know there hasn't been one that big shot on this estate since
And it might be nice to find one to rival him.
Eclipse him. A rival and enemy.
Glowering at him across the room.
Question is, whose name will be underneath it?
Mine. Mine.
Mine. Mine.
No, mine.There's not a question. Well, it won't be yours.
Mine. Stop it!
Mine.
You were very kind to have come.
Oh, I loved it. I adore Verdi.
He's so so romantic.
Yes. But to focus simply on romance
diminishes Verdi's legacy and political influence.
His music played such a key role in the Italian unification, too.
Gosh. Really?
Do you have a busy summer?
No, I'll be in London for most of it.
I'm embarrassingly available, if that's what you're asking.
I'll be in Zimbabwe for a couple of weeks and then Scotland.
But perhaps we can meet again in the autumn.
Oh dear. You'd rather not. No, it's just such a long way away.
Oh, it'll fly by! No, it won't.
It'll drag horribly. But all good things come to those who wait.
Your chaperone would never allow anything more.
She'll do whatever you tell her. Granny's the most hideous snob.
Good night.
Was that very frigid? Yes.
But perfectly gentlemanly. Princely.
Sorry. Princely.
I thought we might begin today with plans for the forthcoming Budget,
which the chancellor and I have now had an opportunity to discuss.
Given the very pressing need
to bring public sector borrowing and inflation under control,
this government will embark on what Geoffrey has confirmed
is one of the boldest and most far reaching programs
of fiscal correction this country has ever known.
With respect, Margaret
Four billion in spending cuts?
Strict new spending limits on government departments,
the abolition of the 25 pence rate of tax
This isn't a correction.
It's butchery. You're trying to move too fast.
That is because I am in a hurry.
Anyone with any experience... Or sense.
would see that the decimation of the public sector and heavy industry
would risk the specter of mass unemployment
Social unrest.
And fly in the face of everything we stand for.
Hear, hear.
Remind me.
What is it we stand for?
We are the Conservative Party.
We stand for conservatism, caution.
Stability.
Moderation.
Thank you, gentlemen. Prime Minister.
These are our priorities,
not some wholesale reconfiguration of the state and its institutions.
It's too rash, it's too reckless,
and you risk turning not only the country against us
but your own party,
your own colleagues, us, against you.
Nice and still, please. Three, two, one.
Thank you.
The way those men patronize me,
lecture me.
Those squires and grandees
Upper class bastards.
And their ideas,
their solutions to the problems this country faces,
so unimaginative, and cautious, and
wet.
Speaking of wet,
that's the forecast for Balmoral.
So no golf for yours truly.
My father used to give a sermon.
"God needs no faint hearts for his ambassadors."
They are faint hearts.
And I should have kicked them out when I had the chance.
I had a call from Malcolm Muggeridge this morning,
who said, "Watch out for the tests."
"Oh, which tests?" said I.
"The infamous Balmoral tests," said he.
Apparently, the royal family routinely subject all their guests
to secret tests, to find out whether someone is acceptable or not acceptable.
U or non U, part of the gang or not part of the gang.
Apparently, it's ruthless,
a blood sport in itself.
Prime Minister.
Welcome to Balmoral Castle. Yes.
Mr. Thatcher. How do you do?
Her Majesty asked me to apologize for not meeting you in person,
but she's out stalking with the rest of the family.
Oh yes. Well, we'll take this one, dear, thank you.
They're both yours, ma'am.
Well
Thank you, dear.
No, it's all right. It's English money, but you can spend it in Scotland.
It's not that, sir. Tips are left at the end of the stay.
Instructions are on the protocol sheet on the table.
Oh. Well, go on. Take it anyway. Won't tell a soul.
No, no, dear, I like to do that myself, especially for my husband.
Sorry, ma'am. Thank you.
Unpacking your bag?
What was she thinking? That's a wife's job.
And two bedrooms.
I know. It's all very odd.
Are we allowed to sleep in one bed?
I shall go and check with the protocol sheet.
What do you think 6:00 p.m. is? Drinks or dinner?
Oh, who knows?
What do I wear? What the heck? Who cares?
Well, I care.
Every house has rules,
and places like this are all about what you wear and when.
On the plane, you said there were tests.
Oh. So you did hear what I said. Of course I heard what you said.
I don't need to look at you to show you I'm listening to what you're saying.
Well, it might be nice.
I don't have the time to be nice.
Well, I'm sure to worry about it all would be to fail the tests.
6:00 p.m. is drinks before dinner.
Dinner is black tie, ergo drinks are black tie.
I couldn't help noticing, ma'am, you didn't bring any outdoor shoes.
That's right.
What a strange thing to say.
Did anyone actually see him?
Anne caught a glimpse out by Connachcraig.
Did you get a shot off?
Not for you either? No. How about this lot?
Bit early in the season, isn't he?
Most of the hinds haven't come on heat yet.
Most likely in rut and had broken out of the herd.
We'll have to get you another crack at it.
We'll get him tomorrow.
Now let's sort out some tea.
I'd love a whole pot.
Right.
Where to now? Oh, I hear something.
Oh, I do believe
Here? Yes.
What are they doing?
Christ.
Prime Minister. How nice to see you.
Your Majesty.
And dressed for dinner already.
How very thoughtful of you.
We shall have supper early. Don't be ridiculous.
It's six o'clock.
Tell the kitchens we'll eat in 45 minutes.
But it's teatime.
Good boy.
Your Majesty.
Good evening. Good evening.
Your Royal Highness.
Christ, do we thinkÂ they'll come to lunch tomorrow in their pajamas?
Well, I think we've failed that test.
Good evening. Ma'am, you're sitting second from the end onÂ the right,
and sir, you're sitting on the left
I could have sworn I heard him at one point.
Did you call back? Yes, I tried. Erm
Yes.
Mark, you do it better.
That is absolutely terrible.
Louder.
Did I hear there was a sighting on the western shore of the loch?
Ridiculous suggestion.
Why is that? Low ground. It's too open.
No, the high tops and the ridges.
That's where you'll find him.
I see. Am I right?
criminal offense to kill a perfectly healthy breeding stag like that.
But commercial guests want trophies
and are prepared to pay huge amounts of money,
and our neighbors are greedy enough to take it.
I have some sympathy.
It's business.
It's not business.
It's conservation.
This is what people fail to understand. It's pure ignorance.
Now, how about a round of games after supper?
Number five ibble dibble with one dibble ibble
calling number four ibble dibble with two dibble ibbles! Ahh!
That was the best I've ever done it.
Number four ibble dibble with two dibble ibbles
calling number seven ibble dibble with one, two, three, four
eight dibble ibbles!
So, number seven dibble bibble...
Oh, Mummy! No, you bibbled!
Oh no!
Margot, show Granny how it's done.
Tippity toppity, down with the Nazis!
Number three ibble dibble with two dibble ibbles
calling
number one ibble dibble
with no dibble ibbles.
Oh. That's you again. Good luck, Prime Minister.
All right.
Oh, thank you.
Number one ibble dibble
with no dibble ibbles
calling number
ten
ibble dibble
with
six dibble ibbles.
Oh, dear.
Well done. Did I get that right?
Yes, you did. Very good.
Would you mind passing that down?
Great.
Well done.
What was she doing? She was rather hopeless.
But I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt.
It was probably just nerves.
Of what?
Of the situation, of where she finds herself.
We were playing parlor games, having fun.
Perhaps her idea of fun is something else entirely.
Or she's incapable of it
and wouldn't know fun if it bit her on the backside.
Well, I've taken pity on her and invited her stalking tomorrow.
Good luck with that!
Good night.
Oh Lord, you're not gonna start work now, are you?
Well, what choice do I have after wasting a whole evening like that?
Oh, come on! A bit of harmless fun.
To make matters worse,
the Queen has invited me to join her stalking tomorrow morning.
Yes, you laugh, but it means I have to get ahead of the work now.
All right, then.Â Why don't I go and sleep in the other room?
Don't you dare!
We don't want to catch any upper class habits.
Those that sleep apart grow apart.
It's just for one night.
And that's precisely how bad habits start.
So you can stay here, and
well, there's a book on the bedside table.
Very well, dear, whatever you say.
I didn't realize
Hunting Memoirs of Balmoral Castle. Oh yes.
You read that while I do this.
Oh, I can't wait.
"Fifth of September, 1848."
"A letter from Prince Albert to Marie,
Dowager Duchess of Saxe Coburg"!
"The rain has not stopped
for one minute since we arrived,
but it has not prevented me, naughty man,
from spending the whole week creeping stealthily after glorious stags."
Stay.
Yesterday, actually, her performance was quite poor.
Yes, I'm making myself odds on to bring him back by lunch.
Ha! I'll take you on that bet.
Better put your money where your mouth is.
Where is she? He's most active in the morning.
I don't want to lose my shot.
Oh God!
Say nothing.
Prime Minister.
What a lovely morning.
Shall we?
We're in here.
We're in this one.
Thank you, John.
Come on, boy. Come on.
I'm so glad you agreed to join us.
I didn't have you down as a sportswoman.
I'm not, ma'am.
I'm afraid we're all mad stalkers.
It was how I spent some happy times with my father, King George.
He taught me everything. My father taught me a great deal too.
What did you do together?
We worked.
Work was our play.
I worked with him in our shop.
As an alderman, he took me everywhere.
I watched as he wrote his speeches
and listened as he rehearsed and delivered them.
It was my political baptism.
How lovely for you both.
Yes.
Now, if you don't want to break your ankles,
you should have a think about those.
What size are you?
Five.
Oh, that's handy! Me too.
When stalking, the trick, really, is to disappear into nature,
to preserve the element of surprise.
So next time, you might not wear bright blue.
It means the stag can see you.
Or wear scent.
It means he can smell you.
And now he can hear you, too.
I could go back and change.
Oh, that's an idea!
If you hurry, you can make it back in time for lunch.
I'll be as quick as I can.
Ma'am.
Mary.
I'll drive out and join them for lunch.
Do we know where?
I think I heard them saying they're going to the Loch Muick beach, ma'am.
Ah, yes.
No.
What are you doing?
Your Royal Highness.
Aren't you supposed to be out there stalking?
Yes, I was, but your sister...
No, you don't call her that. You call her "the Queen."
She's the Queen, not my sister.
And that chair, no one sits in that chair.
Oh, I beg your pardon. God, don't say that either.
Say "What?"
Begging for anything is desperate.
Begging for pardon is common.
That chair
no one sits in that chair.
It's Queen Victoria's chair.
And you do realize this is supposed to be a bank holiday?
Yes, although it is hard to have a holiday
when the country is in its current state.
Mm. The country has been in a state before.
It will doubtless be in a state again.
One learns, when one has the benefit of experience,
that sometimes time off is the most sensible course of action.
Hm. Well, I'm not best suited to time off.
It gives me no pleasure.
It might give you something more important than that.
Perspective.
Good evening, Your Royal Highness.
Is there nothing I can say to persuade you to come for the weekend?
Why? I have no place up there.
And I'm busy anyway.
Doing what?
What is so important that you decline an invitation from the heir to the throne?
Being a mother.
And a wife.
Well, it's never stopped you before. Now, now.
It's true.
You need to find a young woman who's free to be where you want when you want
and is willing to give up her life for you.
Like this new one.
Diana Spencer?
Mightn't she fit the bill?
Don't say that.
I'd much rather hear how jealous you are.
I would be, but
it's not helpful, is it?
Given the situation we find ourselves in.
What's now required of you.
I'm serious. You should ring her.
And say what?
"I can't stop thinking about you."
"I can't bear to wait the whole summer before seeing you."
"Any chance you could drop everything and come up to Scotland now?"
Members of Mrs. Thatcher's cabinet have expressed their alarm
at new figures showing a sharp rise in the rate of unemployment.
Unions are blaming the increase on the continued commitment
to a policy of wide ranging spending cuts.
This is now a very worrying situation indeed.
We have the most incompetent and radicalÂ Labour opposition ,
that should be in the wilderness, now snapping at our heels.
No one would doubt the strength of the prime minister's convictions.
But what we need is a mature and more experienced leader
who shares our values.
The danger is, we have a prime minister whose inexperience,
whose unwillingness to recognize that her policy is failing
might very well lead us over the cliff edge.
I think that many in cabinet will now be asking
if it isn't time for a change.
Francis Pym is definite about Mrs. Thatcher's monetarism policy
Next up, we've got Mark Watson from Jedburgh,
current record holder for the hammer throw here in Braemar.
He has got to beat Francis Stewart from Fort William.
Just back from injury, he managed to throw it
eighty four feet.
What am I doing here?
Miles from Westminster,
miles from reality,
wasting precious time in some
Half Scottish, half Germanic cuckoo land?
Yes.
Here's local boy Gary McNeil
Here we go.
Here's the Duke of Edinburgh handing over this year's haggis to young
And I'm struggling to find
any redeeming features in these people at all.
Remember, the haggis must be fit to eat
They aren't sophisticated, or cultured,
or elegant, or anything close to an ideal.
They're Boorish, snobbish, and rude?
Yes, DT.
Just like those patronizing bullies within my own cabinet.
All members of a certain class, you'll notice.
if this country really is to turn the corner,
then I say it needs to change fundamentally.
Top to bottom.
Yes, just put that there. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Jolly good. Thank you.
What happened?
There was a crisis, apparently. Huh.
Life in post war Britain
has been one long, painful, uninterrupted crisis.
But no matter how bad things got,
none of the other prime ministers left early.
No, one could scarcely get rid of them. Hmm.
So how come this one can't get away fast enough?
Perhaps we weren't very friendly.
What are you talking about? I was incredibly friendly.
I positively gushed.
Who's that?
Lady Diana. Hello.
Welcome to Balmoral Castle. Thank you.
Lady Fermoy is here for you. Oh.
Hello, Granny.
I hope I don't need to tell you
how fortunate you are to have been invited here,
how unique an opportunity this is
or how much is potentially at stake for our family.
It's just a weekend.
The most important weekend of your life.
The Prince of Wales has kindly promised to take me fishing.
I'm hoping it'll be my first time in Scotland
when I manage to catch something other than a cold.
I can't keep up.Â Is this one a friend friend or a girlfriend?
In the balance, I think,
hence the invitation up here to see if she sinks
or swims.
I learned very quickly that wasn't right.
Not that I've ever had much more luck with a gun.
Good morning, ma'am. 5:30.
His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh
has requested you accompany him stalking this morning.
Gosh.
All right. Will you be needing anything?
Well, like what?
I just thought, in case you have no outdoor shoes
I only brought outdoor shoes.
Hmm.
I apologize for the early start,
but there's a reason I asked you to join me this morning.
There's great excitement gripping the household.
Oh, yes, the stag. It's all anyone could talk about at dinner last night.
I don't mean about the stag.
I mean about you.
I thought this might be a time for us to get to know one another.
Are you sure this isn't too wet?
No, I love a good watering.
You don't mind a bit of mud?
Muckier the better. I'm a country girl at heart.
Good.
So I suppose I must have seen you growing up on the estate at Sandringham
when you lived in the cottage there.
Yes, sir.
Where do you live now?
London, Earl's Court, in a flat with three girlfriends.
I'm the bossy landlady.
Are you bossy?
I like things to be neat and tidy. Quite right, so do I.
Does that come from the army, sir?
The navy. And I'm the one asking the questions.
Sorry.
So is that what you do all day? Be a landlady?
Oh, no, sir. My main job's as my sister's cleaning lady.
Right. Well, that's a very important job.
Yes, it is.
I hope she pays you properly. One pound an hour.
Sorry, I don't know what the going rates are for domestic cleaning.
Well, that's a very top rate.
Only for the very best executive level cleaners.
Is it? No!
It's a complete rip off. I don't know why I do it.
Perhaps because you enjoy cleaning.
Actually, I do quite enjoy cleaning.
And ironing. God, does that make me tragic?
No, it makes you fascinating. I can't wait to discuss it further.
Sir. What?
Look. Oh yes.
Oh, you clever, clever thing.
Shouldn't we try and get closer? No.
We'll never get another chance.
We have one shot at this.
Where's the wind coming from? The right?
It's the left, sir.
What? Well, look at the clouds.
It's swirling.
No, I say the right.
It's the left.
Good shot, sir.
Was it from the left?
They have!
Look.
Gosh.
So we found him, yes.
What a triumph!
Gosh, they've got him. Well done.
He's a beauty.
I have Diana to thank.
No, I did nothing. No, you, uh, you spotted him, not me.
But you shot him, sir.
It wasn't an easy shot.
No. It was brilliant.
Right, let's get a closer look, shall we?
Walking four hours before we found him.
Four? Four.
A single shot? A single shot.
Mummy, it's impressive, isn't it?
Thank you so much for coming.
Has it been awful? Not at all. It's been heavenly.
No one's ever said that after their first visit.
But it has been.
You weren't put off by all the scrutiny? My family's just as bad.
Anyone new, everyone tortures them trying to catch them out.
I'll get all the reports tomorrow.
Let me know if I passed.
I'm sure you have.
With distinction.
You've been a great sport.
Thank you.
So
how's it going up there?
You don't want to know.
I do, actually.
Talk to me.
She's a triumph.
In the history of Balmoral,
no one has ever passed the test with such flying colors.
Well, well, well.
Rave reviews from the whole ghastly politburo.
Anne, Papa,
Margot,
Mummy, Granny.
Then I was summoned for a conversation with Papa
in the hanging room, where,
oblivious to the grotesque symbolism,
it might as well have been me strung up and skinned.
You asked to see me?
That Diana Spencer.
What about her?
He made the family position painfully clear.
They want me to marry her.
Gosh.
Yes.
She really was a triumph.
This was always going to happen.
The right one was always going to come along.
But is she the right one?
Is anyone actually asking themselves that?
She's a child.
The Prime Minister, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
I do hope you enjoyed your holiday. Very much.
Scotland in the summer is such a blessing.
I'm always mystified by those that don't feel at home at Balmoral.
Some people just don't.
They come and are bewildered by it,
by the weather and traditions.
They see only cruelty in the blood sports
instead of kindness or necessity.
But there have been blood sports here too.
You have a brand new cabinet. I have.
Mostly older ministers that were culled.
Yes, although it wasn't just their age that decided it.
Rather? Their background, mostly.
And lack of grit,
as a consequence of their privilege and entitlement.
Always a mistake to assume just because people are privileged,
they lack grit.
And a dangerous game, I think, to make enemies left, right, and center.
Not if one is comfortable with having enemies.
Are you?
Oh yes.
Inspired by the words of the Chartist poet Charles Mackay.
"You have no enemies, you say?:
"Alas! My friend, the boast is poor."
"He, who has mingled in the fray
Of duty, that the brave endure,
Must have made foes! If you have none,
Small is the work that you have done."
"You've hit no traitor on the hip,
You've dashed no cup from perjured lip,
You've never turned the wrong to right,
You've been a coward in the fight."
Good evening. Well, so now we know. Three cabinet ministers sacked,
the cabinet changes, and a long list of promotions
and demotions in the junior ranks.
Mrs. Thatcher has well and truly shuffled her cabinet.
Well, in a moment, we'll be looking Ah.
Eeyore.
I came to see how you were getting on. I'll be fine.
Could you be a bit more than fine just once?
After a selection process that involved half of Britain,
you've somehow stumbled on the perfect one
in age, looks, and breeding.
Or have you managed to find fault even in perfection?
No.
No, she is
undeniably gorgeous.
Those legs.
Cow.
And appropriate.
Well, then
I just wish I'd had more time.
What for?
Well, to find out who she is. We hardly know one another.
There'll be time for that later. That's what everyone keeps saying.
"There'll be time for that later, just get on with it."
I concur.
What does you know who say?
Depressingly, she's all for it.
Of course she is.
Everyone's all for it because everyone understands
it's time to finally close this chapter.
To put the whole Parker Bowles soap opera behind us.
All of us.
For good.
Yes.
Oh, was that a smile?
It will be soon.
Don't fight it.
She's perfect.
She even got the stag, damn her!
It must be written in the stars.
Let's go.
You going or not?
First, you want to go out, then you don't.
You want to pee, then you don't.
Which is it?
Okay. One last try.
Here? Yes?
Go on.
Hello? Emergency services?
Police, fire, or ambulance?
I'm standing at Pont de l'Alma. There's been a crash in the tunnel.
I think it's serious.
We'll come as soon as we can.
It's okay.
Remind me, why is Princess Diana even coming?
Because she asked us for a meeting. Given who she is, I could hardly say no.
Oh, you were never going to say no.
Remember last time, you put on your cowboy boots especially.
Did I? Yes. And wore tight jeans.
Tony Blair, Sheriff of Downing Street.
She's brought William with her. That's a surprise.
He's grown.
Yes. Sweet looking.
For an alien.
Now, now.
I'll call the kids.
Euan! Kathryn! Nicky!
A future king has come for a play date!
Welcome. Lovely to be here.
How was the journey?
Fine. Good, thank you.
Great. Good to see you.
I hear you had a visit from Princess Diana.
Yes, she came to Chequers last week with Prince William.
Euan! Will!
We had a nice game of five a side.
I'm staying out of this one.
That's football. Uh...
Yes!
Then we had lunch.
Then the princess and I went for a walk around the grounds.
She feels strongly that she still has a lot to offer the country
as a public servant. And a lot of energy.
Are you the person to do that? In an official way?
If you take her recent work on landmines,
two years ago, a global ban on landmines was considered impossible.
Now, almost a hundred countries have agreed to sign a treaty outlawing them.
When Diana talks, the world listens.
Yes.
She wanted to know if I,
that is, the government,
could find a way to harness her gifts on a more formal basis.
And that any official role I...
we
might offer her would be enormously, uh, appreciated.
I always say it's hard to be half in anything.
You're either in or out.
You yourself will know the difference of being in government or out.
Whilst she's mother of the boys
and, in that respect, always welcome at the palace,
as a divorced woman and no longer an HRH,
Diana is now learning the difference between being
officially in the royal family,
and out.
Come on, Wombat, darling. Time to get up.
Summer holiday.
Come on.
Who were you wrestling in your sleep?
Godzilla.
Did you win?
Beat him up.
Beat him up!
Gotta get up to get down...
Wow. From Mou Mou.
Ma'am. Morning.
Hello, thank you. Morning.
There we go, ma'am.
Good afternoon, madam.
It's not for long. It's ten days.
Yes, but it's ten days of waterskiing and Nerf guns.
As much Street Fighter as you can play.
I just wanted us all to be away
when your father threw a huge 50th birthday party for you know who.
I didn't want to be in the country when that was going on.
Sure.
Want to kill him first or shall I?
Sure, I'll kill him first. Okay, go.
No...
That's marvelous. I think he's gone in there with them.
We've confirmed at least 50 journalists and photographers
at the Street Farm entrance,
perfectly placed to capture the arrival of the guest of honor.
Well, I'd better not go arse over tit.
What news from my family?
Invitation reminders went out two weeks ago.
And replies?
It's vital that the Queen attends this weekend.
As I understand it,
just Princess Margaret has confirmed so far.
Will you follow it up with her private secretary
and stress how important it is to me?
Of course.
A public gesture of approval from the Queen
would transform the campaign for Camilla's legitimacy.
Everything else is just... window dressing, frankly.
It's fine. It'll happen in its own time.
Diana and I have been divorced for a year, separated for five.
The time, darling, is now.
I shall have to go and see her myself.
Hello?
Where are you?
Paris.
Choosing fabrics and bedding for the Malibu house.
The wedding is in three weeks.
It's our last chance.
I don't know whether to laugh or cry.
The greatest opportunity in history opens up,
and he's choosing fabrics.
I need you to come to Saint Tropez immediately.
I have a special guest I need help with.
What special guest? You'll find out when you get here.
But it's a very special guest.
So come alone.
Don't bring Madame Bikini.
Who?
The gold digger.
Leave her in Paris with her swimwear.
Underwear. Fabrics. Pillowcases.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
There's a
business emergency.
My father needs me to join him.
I know, baby. It's the last thing I wanna do right now.
But when Daddy says, "Jump..."
Don't be like that.
It's true, though, isn't it?
Come, go, jump, sit.
A few more weeks
and we will be in California,
and there will be an ocean
between him and us.
Say hi, boys.
Hello. Hello.
Your Royal Highness.
Mou Mou.
Thank you for having us.
Your Royal Highness. Thanks for having us.
Nice to see you.
And who do we have here making noise in the swimming pool?
My children!
Karim.
Hi! Raise your hand, boy.
Camilla. Hi.
Omar. Hi.
And beautiful Jasmine.
Only one is missing.
Drinks? That would be lovely.
Yes, please.
One moment, sir. Yes, I do know the drill. Are you new?
The Queen will see you now, sir. Thank you. There's a, um...
Never mind.
The Prince of Wales, Your Majesty.
Mummy.
This one's having a bit of trouble.
She won't drink.
It's funny being kept waiting at the door always.
Takes me back to when Anne and I were presented to you and Papa
every morning at nine o'clock.
And then at the end of the day, bathed and ready for bed.
Best two moments of the day.
Was it?
Yes. It seems like another lifetime.
And as if it were yesterday too.
Anyway,
you wanted to see me.
I did.
I came to ask you whether you'd received my invitation
to the birthday party I'm hosting for Camilla.
Yes, I think we did receive that. It was weeks ago.
Good.
Which leads me to my next question.
Are you coming?
Can't, I'm afraid. I'm going to be in Derbyshire.
For?
Rolls Royce factory.
Really? You're visiting the factory in the evening?
I don't know. It's possible the factory is on Saturday morning,
and I need to make an early start.
Well, can I check?
Why would you do that?
Well, because if it's on Saturday,
then you could stay at Highgrove on Friday night
and travel up to Derbyshire from there.
That may be, but plans have been made.
You know how long in advance these things are worked out.
Well, they can always be changed.
Why would we want to change it?
Is it really so important I attend?
It is to me.
It's just a birthday party.
Her 50th.
So you'll have a house full of other 50 year old youngsters.
Why would you want your decrepit old mother there?
I think you know why.
Quite apart from the fact that
you improve any occasion with your presence,
your attendance, not only as my mother but symbolically as Queen,
would be transformative for Camilla.
She will never be fully embraced by the public until she has your approval.
But how can I possibly give my approval when I don't approve?
It's nothing personal. I'm sure she's very nice.
Rather more than that.
It's a matter of principle.
Two perfectly good marriages,
two perfectly happy families have been broken up by this...
Love, Mummy? Love?
I don't want to debate this any longer. I'm going to be in Derbyshire.
Now, was there anything else?
Because I think this one could really use my attention.
Couldn't you?
Yeah, huh? A bit of this. Here.
There we go.
It's fine.
Oh, come on. It's not that bad.
I agree. If we had briefed that the Queen would be attending,
it would be a humiliating climbdown, but we didn't.
I'm sure she'll come round eventually. At least one hopes she will.
I'm happy to wait.
But when?
When she realizes how out of step she is on this matter.
The Mirror is going to be running a survey to be printed on Mrs. P B's birthday
that shows that two thirds of all respondents
now accept the relationship and believe you should be free to marry.
Really? Really.
I mean, it used to be that Diana had the winning narrative.
The fairy tale princess that was wronged.
But since Panorama, that's all changed.
All her choices at the moment are just making it worse.
Going on holiday with Mohamed Al Fayed.
The more desperate the stunts, the more tawdry the spectacle,
the more dignified you look by comparison.
I believe it was Napoleon who said,
"Never interrupt your enemy when they're making a mistake."
Diana!
William! Do you wanna throw them this?
Harry! Be nice.
Diana, please, look this way!
William! Diana!
Diana!
Diana, one more!
Diana, pass me the ball!
Diana, look! Harry!
One more! One more!
Baba.
What's going on?
What is all this? Why am I here?
My son.
I would have thought you'd start with a "thank you."
For what?
For putting her on a plate for you.
Who? What are you talking about?
You know the Princess of Wales?
Yes, we met years ago.
Windsor Horse Show. Dodi Dodi. Yeah. We met.
You remember?
You're clever clever.
Now, very sadly, I have some work to do, but I can leave you in Dodi's hands.
He is much more fun than me.
Whatever you wish
is his command.
Wh... What?
Excuse me, one moment.
Wait!
Baba.
What is this?
Are you out of your mind?
This is the craziest idea I ever heard.
Why?
First, because I'm about to get married.
Uh huh.
Second, she's not in the slightest bit interested in me.
Then make her interested. Isn't that what you've always been able to do?
Make women fall in love with you?
This is your chance!
This is your chance to finally make me proud of you!
Right.
Who wants to go swimming?
Three, two, go!
Hey!
Hey. Hey, baby.
I'm just checking it's not too stressful with the business emergency.
Uh... No. No.
It's okay.
We, uh... we sorted it.
Good.
And, um, did the emergency involve Princess Diana?
What?
I'm asking if it involved Princess Diana because it is all over the news today
that she's in Saint Tropez with your father.
Yeah. Uh...
That was a surprise for me too.
My father obviously changed plans at the last minute.
Right. Why am I getting a bad feeling about this?
I don't know, baby, because everything's fine.
Well...
...I don't think everything's fine. I actually think it's pretty shitty
that I discover the truth about your movements in the newspapers.
These are not my decisions. I'm just doing what my father tells me to do.
What was that?
Just the kids having fun.
Well, I'm glad you're all "having fun" down there.
They're having fun.
I'm not having fun.
So, why don't I come by,
and then the two of us could have fun together too?
What? Here?
Yes.
I just got booked for an assignment in Nice next week, so...
It makes sense for me to come by and see my fiancÃ©.
Jump!
Okay.
If you want.
Well, why wouldn't I want?
Why are you doing this to me?
I'm not doing anything.
Of course I want you here.
Come whenever you like.
I've gotta go.
How long are you gonna hide in there for?
Until those photographers go away.
You win!
She coming this way?
Here she comes! Oh my God, look at her.
Hello, boys!
You enjoying your holiday?
Yes, we're having a lovely time, apart from you lot.
Don't be like that. You love us really.
How long will we have the pleasure of your company?
The attention's starting to freak out the boys.
I like your swimming costume, by the way. Who's the designer of that?
Didn't know you were so interested in fashion, Nick.
Did you choose it deliberately? Deliberately how?
Well, you must be aware that today is Mrs. Parker Bowles' birthday,
and a big party's being thrown for her by the Prince of Wales.
You know, I'm having trouble hearing you.
I'll tell you what. You leave me and my boys alone,
please, and you're gonna get a big surprise with the next thing I do.
What's that?
What do you mean, a big surprise? Hmm...
You'll see. Get in there, boys, come on.
Thanks for the visit. That's gonna sell. Thank you.
You're very welcome.
Enjoy your holiday. That was perfect.
Strike a pose!
You look terrific.
Thank you, darling. Thank you.
Happy birthday, Camilla!
How very nice of you. Oh, we're going to do... cheers!
Oh, I can't... My heel's stuck.
That's why I have the carpets.
Possibly a Tuesday, but who knows?
I'm sure every day is seamless if you're here.
Thanks for coming.
Bye. I'm starving. When do we have food?
May I just say how wonderful it is to see you all here,
and thank you all so much for coming.
And particularly, I want to thank my darling aunt, Princess Margaret,
and, uh, Camilla's father, Maj. Shand.
Bruce, as many of you know, is a wine merchant,
so he's better placed than anyone else here
to tell us what it is to improve with age.
As one gets older,
one starts to realize
what one really values in life.
One's health.
One's family.
And one's friends.
The people who enrich our lives
and who we can't bear to be without.
Well, tonight, ladies and gentlemen, we're all here to celebrate a person
who, I'm afraid,
I can't bear to be without.
Darling, all of us here can testify to your quite exceptional warmth
and generosity.
But, again and again, I've been struck by something else.
And that is your heroism.
Because over the years,
there have been many people out there,
who know nothing about you,
who've been quite staggeringly unkind
and unfair.
Now, the easy thing for you to do,
the understandable thing, would have been to walk away.
But you haven't.
You've stuck with it.
And you've stuck with me.
And for that, I am eternally grateful.
I wanted tonight to read an excerpt from a famous letter.
It's a story of ardent young lovers challenged by adversity
who have a second chance of happiness later in life.
It's from Persuasion, and it's Capt. Wentworth's letter.
"Dare not say
that man forgets sooner than woman,
that his love has an earlier death."
"I have loved none but you."
"Unjust I may have been."
"Weak and resentful I have been."
"But never inconstant."
Camilla,
for you alone,
I think
and plan.
Will you all join me in toasting the birthday girl?
To Camilla.
To Camilla.
I must say, he's done it beautifully.
The house is gorgeous.
And the happy couple seem very happy.
Good. Hmm.
Do you know, I don't think I've ever seen Charles so relaxed and confident.
And entirely himself.
Is that what this telephone call is about? Are you saying I should have been there?
I think starting to show support for your son in this matter
would be no bad thing.
Because he will be king one day,
and we want our kings and queens to be happy.
Good night, Lilibet.
The problem is, if you'd been there,
it would have shown more than interest.
It would have shown approval.
But since he's not going to give her up, even in the absence of my approval,
I don't want to be considered unkind, because I'm not.
No.
Or for Camilla to be considered... wicked.
Because she's not. No.
Just inappropriate.
Really? Still?
Surely not.
Yes.
You don't think it's time for this discrimination to end?
For us all to accept
she is the love of his life?
"Momentum is with us," you said.
"Opinion has changed."
"The battle is practically won."
Is this what victory looks like to you?
I'd say it was a resounding success, yes.
Really?
Really. We have a slew of favorable front pages.
For the first time in editorials,
Camilla is being spoken of as a potential queen.
Stephen.
The Times front page.
"Champagne Birthday at Highgrove." The Telegraph.
"Party Star. Mrs. Parker Bowles Smiles with a New Confidence."
The ever reliable Daily Mail. "Smile of the Party Queen."
Lovely.
What's the use of a few warm headlines
when Camilla can be eclipsed by Diana at the drop of a hat?
I don't want partial, qualified victory.
This is war.
Only total victory will do.
It's within our power to shape coverage of Mrs. Parker Bowles.
We cannot control the coverage of Diana.
But, if you look closely, much of the content about Diana
is far from complimentary.
They call her a loose cannon.
An exhibitionist.
Off the rails.
She may win the battle for attention.
But that's not the same as the battle for sympathy.
I don't want to go scouring and searching through the newspapers page after page
for negative coverage of Diana.
I want positive coverage of Mrs. Parker Bowles
to be glaringly, screamingly obvious!
Have I made myself clear?
Sir.
Sir.
Why aren't we going there?
To the big boat?
Mr. Dodi said to take you to the small boat.
Yeah. On a lot of them.
No.
Do you like James Bond? Yeah. Um...
We loved, um, GoldenEye.
Harry and I play the game all the time. Did you work on that?
Oh, no, not on that one.
But I am involved with the newest one.
They're, uh... filming some of it at, uh, Pinewood Studios outside of London.
Do you think, uh, you and Harry would visit the set?
Maybe meet James Bond himself.
Pierce Brosnan? Okay, wise guy.
Who's playing the Bond girl? Go on, tell me.
You think you and Harry would like to...
Oh no.
You!
What?
Quick, get it. Throw it back.
Come on! Come on!
Wait, come on. Let's get her! Let's go get her.
Finally.
Where have you been?
Don't ask. Because I've been calling you.
We have so little time together. I leave tomorrow for work.
I know. I'm sorry.
First my father invites them, then disappears. The whole thing is crazy!
What? Hang on. You've been on your own with her?
And the kids.
And the crew. The most beautiful woman in the world.
Everything all right?
Fine.
Thank you.
It's complicated.
I have a fiancÃ©e.
Congratulations.
Why is that complicated?
It's not complicated for me.
It is for my father.
Not good enough for our family, apparently.
Not enough of a catch.
Where is she now?
Right there.
On that yacht?
He won't let her anywhere near this one.
You've been going back and forth?
Without your father knowing? Oh, he found out and went...
And then she found out and went...
And I move between two people who are permanently angry and disappointed by me.
You're lucky to have a father who cares.
Mine barely noticed if I was coming or going.
Sounds perfect.
I went out of my way to get his attention.
Galumphing around, pretending to be a ballerina.
He barely looked up.
I was so desperate to make an impression, I learnt the piano just for him.
I wrote to him every week from boarding school.
I ironed his shirts. I baked him cakes. Even married the Prince of Wales.
Anything to make him notice me.
Be proud of me.
And to think our fathers were such good friends.
Maybe they could have rubbed off on each other a bit.
Could have used a bit of your father's care and concern.
Obsessive control.
Your father could have used my father's...
Traditional parenting?
Complete and utter neglect?
So, when's the big day?
The wedding?
Three weeks.
Supposedly.
Why "supposedly"?
I don't know.
It suddenly all seems a little crazy.
I think that's normal though. To have last minute nerves. I did.
Night before my wedding, I knew it was gonna be a disaster.
You still went ahead.
But my face was on the tea towels, so I didn't really have a choice.
But I do have a choice. I think you're gonna be fine.
You obviously love her, or your father's reaction wouldn't have hurt so much.
Right.
Now, I promised the boys a film on the last night.
Would that be possible?
Of course. We have Jumanji.
The NeverEnding Story? No.
E.T.? Too sad.
Honey, I Shrunk The Kids? No.
Come on!
Jumanji.
"There is a lesson you will learn."
Oh, I got you.
"Sometimes you must go back a turn."
Ow.
Thank you, Judy.
Thank you. That was very quick thinking.
Sarah and I would like to get out of the floor.
So it's your turn, Peter.
Hello? It's me.
Am I disturbing?
Uh, no, not at all.
I just wanted to ask... Mummy.
Shall I go?
...when the boys are coming home?
Uh, Diana's bringing them back tomorrow.
Ah, I see.
Although I've asked the nanny to take them for two days.
I have a meeting in the Prince's Council, and then
I'm hosting a garden party for the emir of Qatar on Saturday.
Yes, it never ends.
No.
And, um...
how was the 50th birthday?
It was lovely, thank you.
Good.
Sorry you had rain.
Oh, did it rain?
Didn't it?
Um... Well, if it did,
I don't think anybody noticed.
Well, I'm happy to hear that. And happy it went well.
And I just wanted to say...
I'm happy you're so manifestly
happy.
Thank you.
Well, good night.
Good night.
Have you managed to enjoy yourself?
No.
So much.
We've all been spoilt rotten, and you're wonderful hosts.
What are your plans for the summer?
Well, I'm going to drop the boys off with their father, then they go to Scotland.
Will you go too?
To Balmoral?
No.
No, I'm not welcome there anymore. Very much persona non grata.
So, you'll be on your own for the rest of the summer?
Yes, all on my little lonesome.
I don't like the sound of that.
I'll be fine. That's mostly how it is these days.
Well...
you're always welcome here.
Come back anytime.
The boat is yours.
Whenever you want, for as long as you want,
with whoever you want.
Okay?
Your fiancé is a lucky girl.
Well,
all that is, um...
Never mind.
Take care.
You too.
Thanks, darling.
Watch your head.
My name is Mario Brenna.
I am 40 years old. I am a professional photographer.
I work in advertising and fashion,
but the market has gone crazy for society work.
Everyone wants pictures of celebrities.
Pictures that show famous people.
They are no different. They are human beings, just like us.
Making mistakes, just like us.
The old rules have changed.
Now there are no rules. It's every guy for himself.
People, they pay one, two hundred thousand dollars
for the right shot.
But the right shot is hard to get.
You have to be like, uh... like hunters.
Killers.
The competition is, um...
crazy.
You have to use the imagination and be creative.
Take risks.
And I take more risks than anyone.
Which is why I am the best.
And why today Mario Brenna is as famous as the people whose pictures he takes.
My name is Duncan Muir.
I'm 57 years old.
I'm a professional photographer
working out of Ballater, near Aberdeen in Scotland.
Duncan! Uh huh?
It's past nine!
My bread and butter work is traditional portraiture.
Weddings, graduations, that sort of thing.
But my passion, and what I'm best known for,
is photographs of the royal family.
Keep going. You've got space.
Is that it? Lovely, Duncan.
Stop now! Stop!
Where the Queen goes,
I go.
There she is. Quick.
It's very nice to be here.
She's a very special lady.
My wife sometimes jokes that I love the Queen more than her.
Well, I do love the Queen.
I'm a proud Elizabethan.
I get fed up with people criticizing the royal family.
I want to say, "You try and do what they do."
Showing up come rain or shine,
punctual and prepared with a kind word for everybody.
Does the Queen know me?
I wouldn't say she knows me, but she often smiles when she sees me.
Ah, there you are, Duncan. Here I am, ma'am.
Don't you ever get tired of it?
Not if you don't, ma'am.
No danger of that.
Is that for me? Thank you very much.
She has a unique way of making us all feel connected to her.
She unites a divided country through admiration for her.
Not many people can do that.
I think we'll miss her terribly when she's gone.
I'm aware that we've been running a little behind schedule
and that some of you have engagements to go to.
You'll be pleased to know that we have just three items still left on the agenda.
We have the latest information about the new royal website.
Thank you.
Robin.
Yes, I'm happy to say that since www.royal.gov.uk was launched in March,
approximately one million people have been logging on every week.
What have they been doing? Logging on.
Nothing to do with timber, Granny.
In other matters, we are pleased to congratulate the Prince of Wales
on becoming patron of the Royal National College for the Blind,
the Welsh National Opera,
and the Stained Glass Museum in Ely.
And the Princess Royal on becoming patron
of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.
Is that it?
No, I'm afraid there is still item 12.
It simply states "confidential."
Yes. Why is that?
I'm afraid, Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses,
we must still discuss Diana, Princess of Wales.
It seems that no sooner had she brought the princes back
from their holiday in the South of France than she returned to Paris
for a secret weekend with Dodi Fayed.
While she, obviously, has every right
as a divorced woman and a private individual
to do as she wishes...
...this latest development has given us and the government some cause for concern.
If one were to imagine a friendship
between the Princess of Wales and Dodi Fayed
becoming a committed relationship,
there is not just the potential damage to the royal family
from a public relations point of view,
but also a fear that his father might use the association with the Princess of Wales
as leverage, and leave the authorities in an uncomfortable position.
How? I don't understand.
Well, because if the Fayed family is seen as good enough
for the former wife of the next king and mother of the king after that,
then how can the government reasonably deny him
the British citizenship he is so actively seeking?
Precisely. Oh, that girl.
Where is she now?
I want a progress report.
Dodi and the princess,
is it a success?
It seems very much a success, sir
No! No!
Lots of talking and laughter.
Talking? What good is talking?
Is there more?
Are they sleeping together?
I... I wouldn't know, sir.
Put the maid on the phone.
Sir? The maid.
Get the maid.
Sorry, sir.
Bianca, where are you?
It's the boss.
Mr. Mohammed?
I want you to tell me if Mr. Dodi and the princess are intimate.
You know the question I'm asking.
I don't know, but they sleep in one room.
Wha...
One room? Are you sure?
Yes, sir.
One room, one bed.
Thank you.
How do I find a good paparazzi photographer?
Not just any idiot with a long lens.
I want the best photographer on the Mediterranean.
What are your plans for the rest of the summer?
Well, from here, I go back to London.
To see the boys before they go to Balmoral with their father.
Then I go to Bosnia with the landmine charity,
but that still leaves time.
Because I don't get the boys back from Scotland until the 31st.
What about you? What are your plans?
I was supposed to be getting married.
Remember?
Oh yeah.
And now?
Now I'm probably not.
I'm sorry.
Does she know about us?
I thought I might fly to LA when you go to Bosnia.
And tell her.
That's brave.
Not as brave as flying to Bosnia and walking in fields of landmines.
Do you know anything about it?
No. It's actually a huge problem.
Quite apart from landmines killing thousands of people, often children,
landmine survivors are frequently rejected by their communities
because of their disfigurements and injuries.
That's terrible.
It was a man called Ken Rutherford who drew my attention to it.
He started the Landmine Survivors Network.
Well, after his Jeep hit a landmine in Somalia,
he lost both his legs.
He said to me, "Every survivor has a date."
"The day they stepped on the landmine."
He said, "Mine was December 16th, 1993."
And I said, "Mine was the 29th of July, 1981,
my wedding day."
Wow.
At least you still have your legs.
I do. Yeah.
Losing those... would be a crime against humanity.
Do you think?
See, I've always thought my arms were better than my legs.
Yeah.
It's a tough call.
What do you think I like most about you?
My eyes?
No, but I do like your eyes.
My credit card?
No.
But I do like your credit card.
Your hands.
Why my hands?
Because men's hands are so important.
Like their lips have to be just the right temperature.
Are mine the right temperature?
I don't know.
Hmm. Need to check.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
What are you drinking? Bloody Mary.
Thanks, John.
Welcome back! Hello! Hello, all.
Here he is, Casanova himself.
Don Juan, Omar Sharif. Dodi Dodi?
How are you, Dad?
Fellowes.
Right.
Right.
Thank you for letting me know. Obviously, I'd like to be kept informed.
Certainly, sir.
We're back!
Put your hands in the air! This is a robbery!
Move up.
There's two there. Thank you very much.
No. You've got to do it, we go past you. That means nothing.
Well, I put the card down... No, wait!
I won too. You don't even know the rules.
I do know the rules. You don't.
Watch the red mist coming.
Ma'am. Telephone call, Mr. Fayed.
Not now. He said it was urgent.
There's a big, red box where you press the button
and all the cards just shoot out.
So, do you get the same amount of cards every time?
Hi, I don't have long.
I know. You're with the boys. Um...
I'm just calling to let you know that,
apparently, there are some photos of us on the boat
being offered to newspapers.
You said no one knew we were there.
I know. It makes no sense.
When are they coming out?
I don't have any more information.
As soon as I do, I'll be in touch.
The photographs were bought by the Sunday Mirror ,
who, we understand, paid Â£250,000.
The fiercest bidding war in Fleet Street history.
The Sun and Daily Mail have each paid Â£100,000 just to reproduce the images.
What's in the photographs?
I gather they have several of the couple kissing.
Do we know when they're going to be published?
This Sunday.
With an extensive advertising campaign on television in the days before.
I'm afraid it will be almost impossible to avoid.
Harry, Pa's here.
Can you pretend to be less excited about leaving me?
It's not because we're leaving you.
No, it's 'cause you're going to your beloved Scotland.
With its rain and dead animals.
I don't know how you can stand it. We like it. It's fun.
Oh, it's fun.
Where will you be again? Bosnia with the landmine charity.
And then?
And then... few days with friends.
Like Dodi?
I might go back on the boat with Dodi.
What?
He's weird.
He's not weird. He's sweet, and he means well.
Harry, we really need to go. Come on, quickly.
Quickly.
Harry, he's waiting.
You're the best hugger.
Come on. Thanks.
Ah, hug!
Really? It's not for long.
It's three weeks. It's an eternity.
I need a world class hug to fill me back up.
All right. Do it properly.
I've got my bag.
Phone call every day.
Yep. Do you promise?
I promise.
Hi, Harry. Hi, Pa.
Oh, another one. All right?
Good. Got you in your ear.
Have you had some fun?
You look better like that. Perfect.
You got seatbelts?
Fingers.
Everything all right?
They can't wait to be rid of me.
Give it a couple of days, they'll be dying to see you again.
Have you got exciting plans for the summer?
I heard Bosnia.
The landmines charity.
Good for you. So proud of you.
Thank you.
Can I make a, um...
request?
Even though we weren't brilliant at being married, can we, um...
can we be brilliant at all this?
I think so.
And not just for them, but for us too.
She didn't get to keep the man of her dreams,
but the friend of her dreams.
I mean, it's much more than a friend.
Partner.
"All right," she said,
giving the brave smile of the runner up, not the winner.
Let's be brilliant at divorce.
Thank you.
But why? Stop it.
Hi.
Good morning, ma'am. Um, Mr. Dodi asked me to give you this.
It's a satellite telephone.
So you can stay in touch over the next few days.
Right. In case things develop.
Okay. Ma'am.
Thank you so much, Diana. Thank you for coming. This is the ambassador.
Delighted. Thank you for having us.
Right. Ready?
This is the mayor, Mr. BegoviÄ‡.
Welcome. Your visit means so much to us.
Now that the war is over, we were afraid the world would move on.
But the work is only just beginning.
That's true.
Welcome. Hi.
They would like to show you the village. Please.
Hello up there.
He was with his father to collect wood,
and then suddenly there was a loud bang.
And how long has he had his prosthesis for?
So they uncovered a mine here yesterday.
The Sunday papers, sir. Thank you.
This one works with the explosion when you step on it.
And the fragmented mine, well, it has...
it scatters little pieces of plastic everywhere.
After waking him up in the middle of the night?
Yeah. It was hilarious. Best night ever.
Let's do it. Ready? Go, then.
Come on.
Now, you remember the drill. If there are any doubts,
stand absolutely still and get our attention.
Ma'am.
Do you have a moment?
I'm afraid it's an 11 page spread, ma'am.
In total, the Sunday Mirror is in possession of 78 photographs,
which are rapidly being syndicated around the world.
Paris Match paid a million francs.
Lunch.
The Globe, an American tabloid, paid over $200,000.
The images have proven lucrative beyond anyone's wildest imaginings.
And now that photographers realize they can become rich overnight,
interest in the princess's private life is unlikely to die down any time soon.
Diana.
One would almost feel sorry for her...
if one weren't so cross with her.
Diana! Diana!
Diana!
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Bosnian war is over.
People are trying to rebuild their lives, but they can't
as there are hundreds of thousands of landmines still hidden.
Every 20 minutes across the world,
someone is maimed or killed by anti personnel landmines.
Diana, does the Queen know about your new boyfriend?
Gordon, if we could stick to the subject at hand, please?
Are you in love, Diana?
Please, can we stick to the subject of landmines?
We're not answering personal questions.
What about William and Harry? What do they think of your new boyfriend?
Is this the surprise? Gonna marry Dodi Fayed?
Where's next after Bosnia? Egypt?
Does Prince Charles approve?
Dodi gonna put you in one of his films?
Please... You planning a future together?
Just another fling? Think you'll settle down?
Is he a good kisser, ma'am?
Thank you.
As a publicist, I can't help feeling sorry for her.
She just spent three days campaigning on behalf of landmine victims.
That's the message she wanted beamed around the world.
Yet all anyone wants to talk about is Dodi Fayed.
And I'm afraid it gets worse.
How can it possibly get any worse?
News is beginning to emerge that Mr. Fayed
is engaged to be married to someone else.
What?!
A Californian model by the name of Kelly Fisher,
whose lawyer is now suing Mr. Fayed for breach of contract,
so I think we can safely say
this isn't going to get quiet anytime soon.
God.
But, in a strange way,
this does also present us with an opportunity.
Coming here today, I couldn't help being struck
by the two very different cultures at play here.
St. Tropez.
Scotland.
Scandal.
Dignity.
Irresponsibility.
Duty.
Selfishness.
Principle. A tabloid princess as opposed to a...
a broadsheet prince.
Now, how would you feel about doing a counter photo?
You and the princes.
Hasn't everyone had enough of photographs?
Well, if anything, this week's events have proved
just how powerful a photograph can be.
How can I justify that to the boys, let alone to myself?
Besides, Diana and I are getting on rather well at the moment.
I owe it to her to be onside.
I assume you haven't seen today's Daily Mail.
Why?
There may be a truce between you and the Princess of Wales,
but that didn't stop her letting her favorite journalist know
that you spent last weekend alone with Mrs. PB.
And didn't want to take the boys when they came back from holiday.
She wouldn't do that.
One weekend.
One!
So I... I do think we should respond in some way.
How am I gonna present the idea of a photo shoot to the boys?
They hate doing that sort of thing, and I don't blame them.
We tell them it's a deal.
That we've agreed to these photos
so that the media leave us alone for the rest of the holiday.
The question is,
where to find a trustworthy photographer.
Does such a thing even exist anymore?
That's lovely, Mr. McGettigan. One more like that, please.
Good. Good. And now perhaps one with Mrs. McGettigan.
Oh, where do I stand?
Oh, just on the left, please. Oh, left.
Can you swap me that light over there?
Good. A wee bit closer in.
Oh, you're good. Have you done this before?
Oh, excuse me just a moment.
Duncan Muir.
Yes, that's me.
Oh, hello, sir.
Okay, is everything in? Yes, that's all I have.
Is everything in? Are you sure? Yes.
Okay. And, Duncan...
Right.
Just calm down. You're making me nervous.
Right. See you later. Good luck.
Right. Good luck.
Why do we have to do this? Because, Will...
All our friends are going to tease us. Exactly.
I very much doubt it.
They will. Especially if you wear a kilt and carry a shepherd's crook.
Like Little Bo Peep.
Little Pa Peep.
Little Pa Peep has lost his sheep and can't tell where to find them.
It's a bad idea.
A baaad idea.
Baaad.
All right, you don't have to wear a kilt if you don't want to.
Good.
Mr. Muir, hello. Thank you so much for coming.
That's why there's no salmon.
Because it's so low.
Prince William, can you come closer in, please?
Widgeon, come.
Two minutes. It's embarrassing.
Two minutes and it'll be over. All right.
Come on.
Lovely.
What's the dog's name?
Widgeon.
Ah, lovely name.
Perhaps you could throw some stones.
Yes, let's throw stones.
Try skimming a couple. Widgeon, ready?
The dog's enjoying it.
I got two.
Two!
Lovely.
One! That's even worse than me. Great.
This'll be a better one. Three. We need three.
Prince Harry, can you stand there next to your father, please?
You come here. Oh...
Thank you. You should chat to the photographer.
Smashing, thank you!
And if you could look to me, please.
That's the shot.
Well, that seems to have been something of a triumph.
The boys hated doing it.
I'm sure.
But, as a contrast with Diana's antics, it speaks volumes.
Did you hear the latest?
No, what's that?
Apparently, yesterday she flew 160 miles
in the Harrods helicopter to visit a psychic in Derbyshire...
terrorizing some tiny village in the process.
Perhaps to help Mr. Fayed decide where his priorities lie,
romantically,
given that he already has an American fiancÃ©e, I understand.
Spare me.
Diana's behavior is becoming more and more erratic.
More and more reckless.
More and more out of control.
Diana!
Instead of learning from her mistakes,
I gather she's flown back to the South of France again.
I imagine she'll settle eventually.
Let's hope.
All one wants is for that girl to find peace.

People automatically assumed
that we were probably puttogether by some guy,
but we did it all ourselves.
Let's go!
We got on stage,
and it happened to be a groupof women really kicking ass.
It was great.
One in a million bands
gets to where we got.
America knewwho The Go-Go's were.
These are The Go-Go's.
Charlotte Caffey, Gina Schock,
Jane Wiedlin, Kathy Valentine
and Belinda Carlisle.
The greatest all-girl groupof all time, The Go-Go's.
The Go-Go's!
- The Go-Go's!
We were really makingbig strides,
loving what we were doing
and being in that moment of,like, wow!

I couldn't walk downthe street at that time.

In the course of a year,
we had gone from playing divebars to Madison Square Garden.

I was on top of the world,
I felt like we had made it.
There never would havebeen The Go-Go's
without the punk rock scenein Los Angeles.
Well, you got it!From Hollywood, The Go-Go's!
Happy Saint Patrick's Day.
There's a problemwith the monitor here,
and I'm getting shocked.
Sorry.
At the time,there were 50 kids tops
in the L.A. punk scene.
It was D.I.Y.
and if you were terribleyou were cooler,
and anybody coulddo whatever they wanted.
It was total freedom.

I was a little bitof an outsider
because I wasn't overtlypunk rock.
You wouldn't think solooking at me,
I look really straight, but Ihave a very twisted mind.
We hated societyand our parents,
but we supported each other.
Everyone was welcome,
outcasts, geeks, gays,straights,
people of color, women.
It was inclusive.

And that was a great placefor me to be,
because I alwaysfelt like I didn't fit in.
I kind of have this image
of being this really happyperson, and I can be.
But I have this thing in methat's just always there,
like, ugh, urgh.
I have a lifelong historyof depression.
When I was 15,I tried to kill myself.
Right around that same time
I was looking atWomen's Wear Daily
and they had all these photosof the London punk scene.
Oh, my God,it really spoke to me.
I was like, 'Ah, I want this!'
So I just started makingmy own punk clothes,
and one weekend I went tothis store on Sunset Strip
that was calledGranny Takes a Trip,
and while I was in thereI met Pleasant Gehman.
This little girl came in,she had huge eyes.
She looked like an animeaction figure.
She had these shirts
that had two zippers sewn inover the boobs,
and so, when you unzippedthem, you know,
your bra or your bare boobswould come out.
She told me that therewas a scene in Hollywood,
a punk scene,
and she gave me a flyerfor this club called The Masque.
In the punk scene, there wasjust so much energy and anger.
And having suppressed badfeelings my whole life,
the suicide attempt wasobviously it trying to come out,
and then,becoming a punk rocker,
I felt was a really positive wayfor it to come out.
People used to cross the streetwhen they saw me.
I felt powerfulfor the first time.
I just felt like I hadfound my home.
The punk scene gave mean outlet to act out
and be the badassthat I thought I was.
I'm the oldest of seven kids.
My father left when I was five.
My stepfather was hardcore,
very much an old-schooldisciplinarian.
We had no money.
I remember growing upand being in school
and always feeling like I waspretending to be something
that I probably wasn't...
I was a real good student,I was a cheerleader.
Does anybody have a cigarette?
...But then, I discoveredthe punk scene,
and that opened upa whole new world for me.
Everybody in the L.A.punk rock scene,
it was like there was invisiblesmoke signals
getting sent out of, like,you know,
'You need to go to this clubon that night.'
And the Sex Pistols were playingat Winterland in San Francisco
and pretty mucheverybody in L.A. drove up.
It was really like a religiouspilgrimage.
They were just the kings of theoriginal, original punk scene.
♪ Problem, problem, problem,problem... ♪
The Sex Pistols gavethis, like, slacker performance
that wasn't compelling at all.
Johnny Rotten at the endof the show
said the famous quote of his.
Ever get the feelingyou've been cheated?
Good night!
You know, it was kind of like,
'Oh, man,you guys were our heroes'
and they kind of suck.
And it also felt like the firstwave of punk was sort of dying.
It was time for some new peopleto start doing something.
I think that was the weekendI actually got to know Margot,
and then we started talkingabout forming a band,
a girl band, actually.
Everybody was in a band.
I mean, it was like the coolthing to be in a band
and we were basicallythe only people left
that weren't in a band,so we decided to do it too.
I met Elissa.
She was one of my high schoolfriend's cousins.
Margot then met Belinda.
The punk scene was so small,
so we all knew each othervaguely.
Thinking about bands likeThe Shirelles
and The Shangri-Las,it was exciting to think
we could do the new versionof that.
But this time, we were goingto play instruments.
With one little problem?
That we didn't know howto play instruments.
Well, I wanted to play bass
and I knew I would haveto learn by doing.
I didn't have drums,I had to go out and find drums.
You know, I had a coupleof weeks of folk guitar lessons
when I was 12,I'll just play guitar.
I certainly thoughtI could sing.
I thought I sounded likeJulie Andrews. But...
♪ We can do what we wantwe can say... ♪
We didn't know whatwe were doing.
In the punk scene it was like,
'Great, you don't knowwhat you're doing?
Just fucking do it.'
We'd sort of been, like,going over different names,
nothing really seemed right.Whatever--
Was it The Misfitswas going to be,
because that's how we sort offelt at the time.
At that time, The Kinks came outwith Misfits the album,
we thought, no, everyone willthink, you know,
we stole it from them.
So, The Go-Go's seemedto fit us.
I remember doing our first show.
It was at the Masque.
Everyone was excited
when The Go-Go's playedat the Masque.
Their set was three songs long
and two of themwere the same song.
We only knew those songs,
so it wasn't a matterof having a set list.
We didn't need one.
There's one song aboutRobert Hilburn
who was a huge music criticat the L.A. Times.
People were either laughing
or completely mortifiedin horror.
It was a big, fat mess.
I wasn't really intimidated
about being as terribleas we were in the beginning.
That was the whole point,
you can sound horribleand still make music.
I think that deep down inside
we knew that we had somethingreally special,
but we needed someonethat actually knew how to do it.
Let's try plugging the ampsinto the wall first,
like, you know what I mean?
When I was very, very young,like, first and second grade,
I had an Elvis Presley record
and Johann Strauss'Blue Danube Waltz'.
I would listen to both of them,like put one on, dance around,
put the other one on,waltz around, yeah.
I started playing pianowhen I was four years old.
At a very young age,I was moved by music.
I had an ear for music.
I went to Immaculate HeartCollege, taking classical piano.
I loved it, but it was kindof snotty attitude,
like, some of these studentswere just like, 'Who are you?'
I started going to some ofthe punk rock shows.
The punk bandsjust busted me open,
knowing that allthis music theory,
rules had to bethrown out the window.
♪ Don't talk to me ♪
When I graduated college,
my best friend Joe Ramirezand I started a band.
We named it The Eyes.
It was one of the mostfreeing things
just to turn up our amps to ten,
bash throughand just anything went.
♪ Don't talk to me,don't look at me ♪
♪ Don't talk to me, oh yeah ♪
'Don't talk to me, don't look atme, don't talk to me...'
That is like a feminist anthem
for women of my generation.
Margot and I wentto an Eyes show,
where we thought,'Oh, Charlotte.'
♪ Yeah ♪
We thought she was perfect.
I'm backstage,
and I see these two sets of legswalking up.
One has spikey heels,
ripped fishnets, a trash bag.
That was Belinda.
She said, 'Hi, Charlotte.'You know,
we're starting this all-girlband, do you wanna join?'
And what am I gonna say, no?
I was totally intimidatedby them
because Jane and Belindaand Margot,
they're all like punksand they're asking me,
like the dork of all time,to, like, join their band.
So, I felt kind of special,I guess.
When they asked,'Hey, do you play lead guitar?'
I lied.
I figured I played bassso, you know,
'Yeah, it's a couple morestrings, it'll be okay.'
We started rehearsing,
but, you know, we were prettycrappy in the beginning.
We really didn't soundthat great.
It was pretty screechy.
I remember going into The Masqueone Saturday afternoon,
hearing some musicand thinking,
'Oh, who's rehearsingdown here today?'
And then, opening a doorand seeing Belinda on stage
holding a mic kind of awkwardly.
I just thought,'Oh, God, that's so great,
women pulling togetherto achieve something,'
and I wanted to supportthat cause and be part of it.
I love communities of women.
This band caught my interestfor that reason.
This song's called'Fashion Seekers.'
♪ Bland ideasin a borrowed head ♪
We saw no reason whywe couldn't be
just as good as the boys or men.
♪ They'll suck the shirtright off of your back ♪
We weren't going to be anythingbut a great band.
They were reallyon the fast track
and they wanted to get going.
And so, they weren't going tolet anything stand in their way.
Elissa was very, very eccentric.
I don't know if she was shyor an introvert,
but she was neverreally part of the gang.
She always held herself apart.
I was coming fromtwo different worlds.
I had to answer to my employer
and I had to answer to the band.
And they wanted me to quitmy job, the girls,
and be more dedicated.
I stuck my toe in the water,but I never dove in all the way.
We definitely neededto bring somebody in
that wanted to be there.
I happened to meet the girlsat a party one night,
and um... that's how it started,I invited 'em over for--
You know, they said, 'Oh, we'relooking for a drummer.'
'Oh, we're lookingfor a drummer.'
And I said, 'Great.I'll try out for the band.'
♪ One, two, three, four ♪
The amps are set up, they bringtheir guitars, plug in,
we play like three songs,and it was like, done deal.
♪ I buy you cologne ♪
Holy shit!
I don't even know howto describe the difference.
It was really, like, ta-da!
♪ I need promises... ♪
The next thing I knowthey found this other drummer.
I was very upset and hurt.
When you kick people outof bands, it's fucking tough.
But at the time, these thingsjust seemed necessary
and they seemedfor the good of the band.
When she was 13she would come home from school,
go up into the front bedroom,
put the earphones onand bang on the drums.
A lot of girls weren'tplaying drums back then and so,
I got in a bandright away.
We were Baltimore's firstnew wave punk band.
We had a lot of fun,
but at that point I was like,'I want to play in arenas,
I don't want to stay playingin clubs my whole life.'
When I left BaltimoreI told everybody,
'The next time you see me,I'm gonna be a rock star.'
I drove across countrywith a dream and a camera.
I was, like,always taking pictures.
I had $2000,and two grams of coke.
I remember the firsttime I met Gina,
she had this frizzy blonde hairand she was wearing overalls.
She looked crazy, and I waslike, 'I'm going to fix you.'
She needed a little bit of,you know, punking up.
So, we cut her hair,dyed it black and she was ready.
Then, I was into takingjust Polaroids.
The punk scene allowed youto be whoever you wanted to be,
play the way you wanted to playand you fit in.
You were accepted.
Being in that settingmade me feel safe.
And it just allowed usa lot more freedom
to do what we wanted to do.
It's like a dream,only you're really living it.
Jane was just so cute and sweetand bubbly
and her little voice.
We both had crushes on eachother, I guess you could say,
but we were girlfriendsfor a while.
She was the bossin the relationship,
I was the new kid in townand it made me feel comfortable.
Jane broke up with me.
It wasn't like either one of uswere heartbroken or anything.
You think something like that'sgoing to fuck with the band?
No way.
♪ One, two, G-O, G-O... ♪
What Gina brought,
besides being a reallyamazing drummer,
is that she made us work hard.
She said, 'You guys haveto rehearse every single night.'
And we're just like,'What are you talking about?'
Hey, it doesn't hurtto rehearse,
it only makes you tighter.
I mean, I was determinedto whip them into shape.
Because I felt there wassomething magical there,
you just needed to push it more.
You needed to get the girlsto be more focused
and more seriousabout what they're doing.
She was right.
We improved and it pushed usto another level.
And I was on fire!
I was sitting at home,it was about midnight,
I was watchingThe Twilight Zone.
You're flying to a new planet,
a planet of light,of darkness and the in-between.
I wanted to write a song
and I was listening to the musicall day long.
I really wanted to writesomething with a beat.
I was hearing somethingin my mind.
I was just sitting thereminding my own business
and all of a suddenthis whole melody,
this whole idea came to my mindand I was like, 'Oh, shit.'
I ran and got my littlecassette player.
And I wrote the song,
it was like five minutes,it just all came out.
The zone of writing,I don't know what happens,
but I can get to that placeand boom,
just these ideas just startflowing and it's like,
it's pretty... pretty phenomenalwhen it happens.
Back then, I didn't havea sense of myself.
Songwriting wasso important to me,
it was my identity,my safety zone.
And so, with 'We Got The Beat'I was terrified.
I was thinking, 'Man,
these girls are going to throwme out of this band'
because it was a pop song.
♪ See the peoplewalking down the street ♪
I don't remember herbeing nervous,
I just remember thinkingit was an amazing song.
I mean, it's just so obvious.
We all loved it right away.

When she started playingthat eighth-note riff,
the pattern that I play on thedrums just poured out of me.
It was 'do-do da-dado-do da-da.'
I felt like we had arrived.
It was definitely another stepup that ladder.
Fortunately, they just loved it.
And I believe that changedthe trajectory of the band.

We were rough soundingwhen we played live,
but we had these songsthat were just coming together.

Just doing those little shows,it was a really cool time.
We were the house bandat The Whisky.
So, we would open upfor whatever bands
would come into town.

we loved that.

I mean, outrageous.
Yeah, we got it!
♪ We got the beat ♪
Come on, don't be too cool.
They thought we were great
and they went back and spreadthe word about The Go-Go's.
And then, The Specials cameand we opened for them.
One of the best things thathappened for The Go-Go's
was meeting us, you know,
and I would say probably oneof the best thing happened to us
was meeting The Go-Go's.
They were young, they werefresh, they were beautiful.
We are a bunch of misfits,of course, that's why it works!
Their manager startedtalking with Ginger
about how to bring us overto England
so we could tourwith both bands.
Somebody from TheSpecials came to me and said,
'We're planninga seaside tour in England.
Do you think your band might beable to get over there?'
And I said, 'Yes!'
I did a lot of pawningof jewelry
and selling a lot of things
to be able to get the girlsover on that trip.
She sold everything.
Her car,she put her whole life on sale
basically to fund usto get to London.
My dad was inthe entertainment industry,
but he was not behind mebeing in this band.
He said,'Hey, there's an opening
at the music libraryat Paramount.'
I remember it was likea really good-paying job,
and I just said to him, I said,'I can't,'
because inside of meI had to leave.
I had to do this,I had to do it.

Because the punk rockscene had started in England,
all the bands that we worshippedwere English.
I mean, England was always,for us,
ground zero of great rock music.
It was like Mecca!
When The Go-Go's come over here,
walking around the city is justreally, really bleak.
Shite, absolutely grim, grey.
It wasn't a very nice placeto be.
There seemed to be an airof something's about to go off.

The Specialsand Madness were both ska bands
and they were stars.
We felt like having theseopening slots with two bands
that were at the topof their game
and were very, verysuccessful there,
that, I mean, how could we fail?
It was our first timetouring in a tour bus
and playing every night.

We were being spit at,
stuff thrown at usevery single night.
Ska music attracted abunch of the white nationalists,
they called themselves theNational Front in England.
And they hated us!
First of all, we were not ska,
so what the hell were we doingopening for these ska bands?
Second of all,we we're Americans.
And third of all, maybe worstof all, we were chicks.
No, we don't dothat...
You know, here arethese five little girls
from southern California,
get up on stage and playto these scary skinheads.
It was frightening.
One venue, a fellawas standing people in a line
with a razor,and another fella with a hammer.
The tours were not going at all
like we thought they were goingto go.
But at the same time,
we were also having the timeof our lives.
There was like a lot of romancesgoing on
between the band members.
But it was good 'cause we allhad boyfriends in like, Madness
or The Specials to console uswhen we got off stage.
Gina is... I love her.
'I just didn't know howto come and approach you.'
I should've asked youto marry me
and you probably would'vesaid no,
but I'd have felt betterthat I asked.
We had such a good laugh,oh, she's lovely she is.
I met Terry.He was in The Specials.
We were very attractedto each other.
We spent a lot of time togetheron the tour
and it was kind ofsort of a romance,
but, I mean, he had agirlfriend, and supposedly,
she was a fiancée and they weregoing to get married.
And I don't know what I wasthinking.
You know, I just thought it wasthis big, important romance.
Behind the scenes,
I was bringing their cassettetapes around.
Stiff Records might have beena small label,
but they had a groupof dedicated people.
I think Ginger asked us
whether we would liketo sign them,
but I thought an Americanpunk girl band
who are objecting tobeing spit at,
I don't knowthat it's going to really work.
But I remember seeing'We've Got the Beat'
as a potential single,
which was my talentto find the door opener.
I tried to publish the song
'cause I could seethat it would do well.
They were really pressuringabout the publishing,
and I had been told
that that was somethingyou don't give up.
Ginger, I think,was a bit more knowledgeable
about the idea of hold ontowhat you've got.
Thank dog she knew
an artist needs to keeptheir publishing,
because really it's one ofthe only ways to make money,
and it's very valuable and it'svaluable for a lifetime.
Well,I stuck to my guns
and signed this one single dealwith Stiff Records.
'Friday,June the 6th in Bridlington.
'Tonight was okay, the audiencewere rude but we played fair.
'Bridlington was pretty shitty.
Oh, well,I guess we'll try harder'.
We were just determined, like,
'We're gonna showthose fuckers.'

There were kids wrapped aroundthe block to get in to see us.

After we got home from England,
I would move back and forthfrom my parents' all the time

Terry stayed in touch.
He would send me letters,and in one letter
he talked about how he dreamedof having his own band.
and he sent me a bunchof lyrics.
And he said, 'I'm going to writethese songs.'
I saw the lyrical beginningto 'Our Lips Are Sealed.'
And even though I'd gottena little bit lazy
about writing music becauseCharlotte was so good at it,
I figured, why shouldI bother, I'll just do lyrics.
But this time, I actually wentback to writing music.

I'm in a punk band.'
And I don't know, I thinkthe rest of us were like,
this is evolving,
so fucking get with itor get out, I don't know.
You know,it wasn't just the music,
it was the sense of beingpackaged into a product.
It was just becoming lessabout art and more about money.
I just felt like, whatthe fuck are you doing it for,
to stay with a followingof a couple of thousand people?
Or do you want to have peopleall over this country
know your musicand know your songwriting,
know, you know, what kind ofmusician you are?
We had shows overNew Year's Eve at The Whisky,
and Margot hadgotten really, really sick.
So, we had to scramble aroundand find someone.
Kathy, I metat the Whisky a Go Go.
I was approached by Charlotte
and asked if I could play bass,and I said yes.
It was a big lie.
I figured, I've been playingguitar five or six years,
why can't I play a bass?
So, I go home.
First thing in the morning,I borrow a bass from somebody.
Charlotte came over.
She brought me a littlecassette.
She left.
I plugged my bassinto my guitar amp.
Feels weird, I use my pick.
I start listening, I can'thear, it's a rehearsal tape.
It sounds, you know... zzzt!
You know, I'm like, 'Shit.'
First thing I have to do islearn on guitar the chords,
because I can't hear.
Then, I started picking upsome of the bass parts.
What I could make outI learned,
what I couldn't make outI just made up my own.
I played it over and over.
I'm a perfectionist, you know.
The only way to do itas much as I was doing it
was to get pharmaceutical help.
I basically learned alltheir songs on a coke binge.
Charlotte came over to seehow it was going.
I went to her house.
She was kind of likein the middle
of like a three-day benderon coke,
and I'd never met anyonelike that.
And I thought, 'Wow, my God.'
She was a badass musician.
She learned those songs on bassin, like, a couple days,
and she had never played bass.
By the timeI'd learned those songs,
I just wanted to be in the band.
In case you haven't noticed,
we have a bass player fillingin for Margot, she's sick,
and her name's Kathy.
Kathy Valentine, yeah.
In came Kathy Valentine likea knight in shining armor.
It was everything that I hadbeen looking for
It was everything that I hadbeen looking for
since I started playing.
I'm an only child,
and it was just meand my mom when I was raised.
I really liked the ideaof a band being a family.
Right away, I just felt like
these are going to bemy sisters.

I remember Margotbeing true to herself
and very authentic.
She wanted to remain a punk bandbut we didn't,
so we just decided it was bestto carry on without her.
I was told I had to dothe firing because,
'You're the manager, Ginger,you've got to do it.'
Because none of them had the...the guts to do it.
It was a shock to geta phone call from Ginger.
'You're out of the band.
The girls didn't wantto tell you.'
It was a decision that they hadmade and that was it.
It was something I'd workedso hard for
and with friends.
People ask me, 'How do you dealwith such betrayal?'
In our little scene in L.A.,
there was lots of gossip andlots of people talking about us,
and not in a good way.
We had fired Margot,we had sold out,
we weren't a punk band,we were ambitious.
In the community,it became like a divorce
because it was like they wereon a rocket to fame
and they decided to fuckMargot over.
I knew I would missthe scene and the community,
but I didn't want to behanging out
where I would risk runninginto them.
I didn't want to see themat all.

You have no idea how barrenthe landscape was in '81.
The idea that women,a host of different women,
would tell their storiesin these kinds of songs
and do it the punk way.
Finding their own wayin a very difficult environment,
that was unheard of.
There was a whole new generationof music coming up
and the establishment recordbusiness
really sort of dismissed them,
and I saw themas a generational change.
Miles Copeland,who managed The Police,
decided to start hisown boutique label.
He called it IRS Records.
Part of whatI wanted to do
was to find some localAmerican bands.
And I'd heard about The Go-Go's.
All girls, punks from L.A.?
Even if they were crapyou'd almost want to sign them,
you know what I mean?

Charlotte tended toisolate herself quite a bit.

Okay, let me talk about myself.
I was full-blown heroin addictat the time.
So, I would be scoring dope,which is so scary.
Like, I'd go downto Alphabet City. Yikes!
When I moved toNew York, I became a squatter
living in what is nowthe East Village,
and I saw Charlotte walking eastto Alphabet City.
The Alphabets is where everyonewould go to cop drugs,
so I knew where she was going.
After I graduated from college,
I tried heroinfor the first time.
'Oh, let me try this.I'll be fine!'
It was like, you know,
a little matchstick head sizethat I snorted.
It made me feel like reallygreat,
and I was like,'Wow, I like this feeling!'
But I didn't understandat that time,

She answeredand she had on her Ray-Bans.
And I said, 'They told methat you do heroin.'

During that Police tour,
our album kept going up and upand up in the chart.
Their album was like a skyrocket,
and that made it really funfor us.
It was like a vicarious thrillbecause we were old and jaded,
to see these women, a new band,
experiencing the thrillfor the first time,
that lit us up.
We were in Atlanta andSting came in the dressing room
and he's got champagne.'Congratulations, girls.'
We're looking at him,like, what?
He said,'Your record has passed ours.'
They were number sixand then we went to number one.
They brought us champagne.
It was actually very gentlemanlyof them to do that
and not kick us off the tour!
Beauty And The Beat'sgone to number one
and I think we were all kindof over the moon.
This is it, this is everything.
Every step along the way,it just kept getting better.
I wish there was another phraseother than 'dream come true,'
because it was so beyond that.
It was like fulfilledeverything.
This is a circus.
When you have somethingthat bucks the system
and succeeds,it opens people's eyes.
They did something that no grouphas ever done before them,
and that is have a number-onealbum in the United States,
being all girls.
They opened people's eyesto potential for women
to do something that had neverreally been done before.
For The Go-Go's to have a debutalbum go to number one,
that's something that only like26 other artists have done,
like you know, the biggies,Elvis, The Beatles.
They made history.
They're the firstall-female band
to play their own instruments,
write their own songs,number-one record for six weeks.
Mic drop.
When I went toThe Go-Go's concert in 1982,
as a young girl goinginto a space
where women own the stage,
and own it unapologetically
like they were born to be there,
to me it represented a momentof possibility.
Thanks, good night!
Thanks a lot!
These-- we're having a highschool reunion, you see.
I went to high schoolwith all these people.
Girls run up to us and say,
'We started a bandbecause of you!'
That's probably the best feelingin the world,
it's really greatto think that you inspire people
to go out and start a band.
So, this is the dawningof a new era, this is it.
Everybody has a differentperspective I'm sure
on what happened atSaturday Night Live.
Oh, God.
We got there11 in the morning,
and we had to waituntil 11 at night basically.
I think it was just a case of us
sitting around a TV studioway too long,
and then, just starting to dipinto the booze.
Let's have a toast, champagne.
And then, oh, it's lunch time,we'll have some wine.
So then, you want to balanceit out,
you want to lift things upa little,
so magically the blow appears.
Right before we went on,
they said, 'Remember, girls,
you're playing in front of 50million people live.'
And we were just like ...
♪ Yeah, we got it ♪
We were like cross-eyed drunk.
The funny thing is, the next daywe sold a ton of records.
Even buzzing, messed-up Go-Go's
being beamed into people'sliving rooms,
it' still something that peopleare just going,
'Whoa, we like this.'
Now that we've had a little bitof success and stuff
and now we know how wonderfulit can be, we want more.
The Rolling Stone cover
was supposed to be a commenton sexism,
and obviously it backfired,
because if we had really beentrying to be sexy
and push our wares as women,
you know, we would have wornsexy underwear
instead of, you know, Hanesand Fruit of the Loom.
It's so tame,but when it came out
it did not help that RollingStone chose the headline:
'The Go-Go's Put Out.'
'Ginger, you've gottacall Rolling Stone.
We're not happy.
We don't like that they usedthese pictures
on the front of the magazine.'
So, I phonedRolling Stone
and asked for Jannthe publisher.
I said, 'Jann, some of the girlsare very upset about the image
used on the frontof the magazine.'
And there was a brief pauseand Jann said,
'I thought you were calling meto thank me for the cover.
You girls need to grow up.'Clunk!
Maybe that's why we're not inthe Rock
those ungrateful wenches.
Our success was so quick,
and I always felt like a littlebit of an impostor
when it came to success,like it was undeserved.
We asked themwhy they are succeeding
where other girl groupshave failed.
The majority of the reason mustbe because of the songs,
if people don't like your songsthey're not gonna wanna
come see you live,or buy your records.
Whether you're a girl orwhatever you are.
I think that timing and luck,there is an element of that.
I think luckily for usthere are now five....
women all in one bandwho all have fear of failure.
Really.
I think everybody,not just the band,
probably the record company,
was scrambling around to figureout what to do next
on the back of such a bigsuccess.
Putting out a second album madesense to the record industry
because they want to make morerecords and make more money.
And they're going to milk itfor everything that they can,
but at a price.
Do you have any time towrite songs now
with all the travelingyou're doing?
We've come,right now we're starting,
this next month we're goingto work on new stuff.
What are you gonnawrite about?
Well, I can't really say
what we're going to writeabout, I don't know.
Vacation as a record,
we were so rushed thatthe songwriting reflects that.
But I felt like, 'Oh, my God,I wrote a hit song
and now what do I do,'you know?
It's like,it messes with your head.
And, you know, you always hearabout the sophomore jinx.
I was freaking out becausewe were scrambling for material

I think the band justgot too big for her to handle.
We wanted to makethe most of the time
that we had in the spotlight.
We wanted to make moneyand continue to be successful,
and we felt like we needed...
a more experienced personat the helm.
It was surprising how quickly
people came out of the woodwork,other managers,
saying how they could doso much better
if they had a big managementteam behind them.
I'm pretty sure that she knew
we wanted her to workwith a bigger manager
that had a firminstead of like one person.
I'm getting kind of choked up,my throat.
It's like...
No, no, it's just thatit's emotional for me,
because going back to that time
it was difficult, remembering itand how I felt.
It was very painful.
My band was taken away from me.
I remember sitting inon meetings
and feeling incredibly little
as the girls saton the edge of their seat
looking enthralledby these new managers,
all men,not that that mattered,
but just like a new power base,
like this was goingto be great,
that this was going to be,like, change everything.
It was horrible having them saywith the band there,
'Well, Ginger, we know you knowhow to take a band from A to B,
and you do a great job.
We can take that bandfrom B to Z.'
We felt like it was goingto help us go to another level.
People that set all of itin motion,
they knew that my dayswould be numbered,
that anyone with any integrity,
you're not going to stickaround. Why would you?
I guess we hurt her,must have hurt her pretty badly
because she just,one day she was gone.
It was no 'fuck you' or nothing,it was just gone.
How angry were you?
Angry enough to moveto New York?
She was like the sixth Go-Go.
When she left, it really turnedinto a big business.
It wasn't even that much funanymore.
We just, that's all we knewhow to do was be a Go-Go.
Gina was in our newmanager's office,
supposedly a more professionalmanagement company
who turned out to suck,
we should've just stuckwith Ginger.
But, I guess Gina saw a checkthat Charlotte got

And of course, Gina wasn'tgetting a check like that.
I almost fell over.
He said,'See how much she makes?
That's 'cause she'sa songwriter.'
There are two waysyou make money out of a record.
You make it in the recordingand the publishing.
The person who writesthe songs,
which is reallythe vehicle that you need...
is going to make more money.
And that can cause problems.
You write a lotof the songs, right?
-Yeah.-With Charlotte?
Charlotte writing'We Got The Beat'
all by herself,that song was huge.
It's like everyone wanted it forcommercials and movies
and TV shows, and that's like
cha-ching, cha-ching,cha-ching, cha-ching.
Songwriting was so importantto me, it was my identity.
That's why I held so close,so dear to me
and, you know, you can't, youcan't take any part of this.
This is mine, this is who I am.
I will still stand behindthe belief that songwriting
is a really specific skillthat many people don't have,
and it's a lot of extrahard work
that other people aren't doing.
I'd made more money
than I'd ever imaginedin my lifetime,
but I knew there was going to bean issue in the discrepancy
between the highest earner,who was Charlotte,
and the lowest earner,who was Gina and Belinda.
I knew there was gonna bea problem.
Most people think that we'rereally rich right now,
but I don't...
I know that we'renot rich right now!

and, you know, and I would say,'I know it's not fair,'
but I felt like inside
like I really had no rightto say anything

We didn't communicate,and then when we did communicate
we didn't do it in a loving,sort of respectful way.
By 1984, things weregetting pretty frazzled with us.
We'd still really never had beengiven enough time to write

'What makes you think you'regood enough to sing a song?'
Which is something I'll neverforget hearing.
It was a huge betrayal,
and I did not know how to getpast it.

We were getting ready to tourfor the third record.
We were at rehearsaland a call came in,
it was like, 'Gina,your doctor's on the phone.'
I was like... We all sort ofstopped, like, what is this?
Gina had always been like comingoff stage, 'I can't breathe,'
and we'd be like, 'Oh, my God,she's such a drama queen,'
like, no, absolutely like nosympathy whatsoever for her.
Now what?
Because she has been seeingthis doctor and that doctor
and we're just like,'Oh, come on.'
But as it turns out she couldn'tbreathe
because she had a holein her heart
and she wasn't getting enoughoxygen. Yeah, so... our bad.
Gina was diagnosed with a holein her heart.
She was going to have surgery.
Heart surgery, what the fuck?
It was a little scary,
but we dealt with itwith a lot of, like, humor.
Our humor was, you know,
always gallows dark.
So, we decided to havethis final lost weekend
in Palm Springs togetherjust in case Gina croaked.
They were taking me outon my last hurrah.
We rented I think a convertibleJag and a convertible Cadillac.
Let's buy a bunch of drugsand go out to the desert.
We had just likea shit ton of drugs
and we're drivinginto Palm Springs
going 100 miles an hour.
It was a total weekendof debauchery
and drugs and drinking.
♪ Sex ♪
And we had a special rule
that Gina was not allowedto do cocaine,
she can only do booze,Valium and mushrooms,
so you know,we were keeping her safe!
Because they didn't want meto have a heart attack.
It did bring the bandtogether temporarily.
It's funny how you canfeel so isolated
from people in the band,
and then in a minute, in asecond, you're family again.
We were really at odds,and when I had that surgery
everybody sort of came togetherfor a while there.
We've gotten a lot ofcalls and letters
and your fans are realconcerned.
If you could just give usan update on your health?
I'm fine.My heart is better.
My doctor told me I can doanything I like.
I can't wait to get out on tourbecause I'm bored to death.
Well, I do wantto talk about the tour.
What kind of tour sponsorshipare you considering?
Before the album wasreleased, that's kind of
when the publishing thingreally came to a head.
We were called to a meeting
at the crappy management'soffice,
and it was stated allthe publishing
needs to be split equally.
And then, I said,'Well, wait a minute,
'this album is totally done.
'I totally agree to do thatfor the next album,
'but I'm not doing itfor this album,
because I fucking workedmy ass off.'
And they're like,'Nope, you gotta do it.'
I'm like, 'I won't do it.'
'You've gotta do it.''I won't do it.'
And then, I just said,'Fuck you, I quit.'
And that's when I quitthe band.
But, of course,I couldn't leave the band yet
because we had a whole,huge tour planned
to support the new album.
She told us that she was, afterthe tour for
Talk Showshe was going to leave.
You guys have beentogether now for quite a while.
Do you still all just get alongas friends?
Argh!
There would be a lotof questions
about what our relationshipwith each other was like.
'Oh, we love each other.We're like sisters.'
Yeah, like sisters that fuckingstab each other in the back.

During the tour,
Jane announced that she wasleaving, which I didn't believe.
And then, sure enough she didand it was really devastating.
I felt completely betrayed.
I felt like...
she was breaking up somethingthat was so precious.
We knew we were in trouble then,
because, I mean,she's an original member,
she's a key songwriter,and she's irreplaceable.
It was like a hatchet had comeand just...
it was never going to bethe same after that.
That was it, really, a pieceof the puzzle was missing.
I felt like the rat that had,you know, left the sinking ship.
The Go-Go's as a unit worked.
And you take out a piece,is the picture complete?
Maybe not.
I just thought thiscould be the end of everything.
All I was, I was a Go-Go,that was all.
That meant I could take careof my mom.
By this time,I'm supporting my mom.
It's easier to finda bass player
than it is a guitar player.
I'll play guitar,we'll get a bass player.
Hundreds of girls wanted to bein The Go-Go's.
Big surprise.
I really wanted Paula Jean,
and the other girls weren'treally agreeing with me,
but for some reasonthey acquiesced,
and Paula Jean becameour bass player.
I felt like Dorothywalking into Oz,
because they were allso much shorter than me.
I knew before I auditioned thatthe band was having problems
because Jane quit the band,
and I had read enoughand followed them enough
to know that things weren'tgoing great interpersonally.
So, we startedrehearsing with Paula Jean,
getting ready to go to Rio.
We're playing the biggest showof our life.
It's the Rock in Rio festival.
Belinda!
What are your expectationstowards the festival?
Should be a lot of fun.
I could tell thatthe joy of them playing together
was not what it probablyonce was.
It felt to me like they wereall trying to muster it
for the occasion.
In Rio,
this is the height ofeverybody's drug intake.
People driving around in cabssearching for coke all night.
I didn't sleep for,like, a week.
I'm supposed to goto sound check
and I went out to cop some dope.
I was late,and I had to make up a big lie,
and that's another thingwith drugs,
like, you become a big liar.
Charlotte was so out of control
that Ozzy Osbourne threw her outof his dressing room.
Now that's pretty fucking bad.
♪ Head over heels,where should I go ♪
♪ Can't stop myself,outta control ♪
♪ Head over heels,no time to think ♪
♪ Looks like the whole world'sout of sync ♪
The Go-Go's were a family,
and, you know,I think that Gina and Kathy
kind of had becomethe caretakers in a way,
trying to hold it together.
Charlotte was there, but youcould tell just not there.
It was just getting to be whereit was unsustainable.
Paula goes,
'You guys, Charlotte'sreally in trouble.'
What?
New girl says what?
I said, 'I just really feellike she's going to die.'
Paula came to meone day and said, you know,
'Charlotte, I know a place whereyou can go to get some help.'
And I said,'What are you talking about?'
She told me about, you know,
a recovery hospital, you know,for addicts.
And then, something shiftedin me.
I went back to Los Angeles
and I checked myself into rehabwith Paula's help.
I'm not saying it was easy,but I was dedicated.
And I'm forever grateful to herfor giving me that information,
because it totally changedmy life and saved me.
When I got sober,it was so amazing
to be free of that prisonthat I was living in.
As dedicated as I wasto my band,
I was dedicated to myself.
When we started rehearsing againfor the fourth album,
I made the decision to choosemyself over the band.
It just wasn't working,it wasn't going to work.
Paula was great,but she wasn't Jane.
The only decent song that cameout of it was 'Mad About You.'
They really liked'Mad About You.'
It's a song that Paula wrotefor our band.
The relationships werejust disintegrating in the band.
Charlotte and I discussedending the band.
Gina and I are feelingmore and more
like Charlotte and Belindaare on one side,
and me and Ginaare on the other side.
Her and Belindacalled Kathy and myself
into management's office.
I was like, 'This is not good.'
It's not good.
Even now, I can't. Rememberingthis makes me feel ill.
'We've decided to break upthe band,'
that was the first thing.
And Gina and I said, 'You can't.
You can't do that,it's our band too.'
'Yes, we can.'
Somebody said,
'She writes the hitsand I am the voice.'
'She's the voiceand I write the hits.'
And Kathy and I were fuckingflabbergasted.
They completely freaked out,completely freaked out.
There was a lot of cryingand screaming.
I definitely raged,
and then, I dialed back the rage
and groveled, apologizing.
I... I wanted to killboth of them.
I really did.
After all we'd been through,
how could you fucking daresay that to me?
I won't survive thisif I stay here
and I cannot risk usingand drinking again,
I cannot risk that.
What was horrible was likegoing home from that meeting
just shattered.
And then, the phone rings
and it's the guyfrom the management company
and my heart just, like, 'Ah,they've changed their mind!'
And instead he goes,
'You're going to get a call fromThe L.A. Times
to make a commentabout the band breaking up.'
It's like, 'What,are you fucking kidding me?'
You know, it's been an hour.
Within months of me leavingthe band ended up breaking up,
and I certainly wasn't happyabout it,
but I also wasn'tsurprised either.
We didn't speak to each other
for five years after that.
Gina and Kathy,I didn't speak to.
Jane was off doing her solorecord.
I felt the need to trysomething new.
I was also interestedin singing my own material.
I was used to being a big star,
and all of a sudden it was like,'She sucks!'
I hated it so muchand I was just so mad,
but now honestly, I really feellike the person I am today
would not exist without allthe failure I went through,
and all the success I ever hadnever taught me one damn thing.
Never.
I tried so hardto create another band
with the chemistry and the magicthat The Go-Go's had,
and nothing I did seemedto work out.
I tried being a singer.
I never wanted to be a singer,but I tried it.
I couldn't be a studio player
because I didn't know howto read music
and that wasn't my thing.
And so, I went outand tried to get a solo deal.
I did one show at the Roxy andgot signed by Capitol Records,
which was great for a while.
And then after a few years,
it was almost like The Go-Go'sdidn't even exist anymore.
It was only like, Belinda!
When The Go-Go's split up
I guess everybody wenttheir separate ways,
but you're the only onewho really hit it big.
Why do you think that'sthe case?
Well, I think I definitely hada head start
as being the focusof the band,
which, you know,people do tend to focus
on the lead singer of any band.
And, you know, that did give mesome advantages.
Belinda offered me a job.
She said, 'Do you wanna tourwith me and write on my record?'
I was so grateful to her,
because that was stillat that place in my life
where that was my identity,doing that,
and just beginning to find outthat that wasn't who--
that wasn't the totalityof who I am.
So, she gave me that bridge.
As they went on,
Charlotte was workingwith Belinda.
Jane is back in the fold.
Now, all of a sudden, it's like,
the three of themare doing shit for Belinda.
I started feeling like it wasa vendetta against me and Gina.
It was... it was horrible.
I just wanted to writeand play drums.
I've written stufffor other people.
I had a song coveredby Miley Cyrus,
and then four songsby Selena Gomez,
so I felt like, 'Yeah, finallygetting what I deserve.'
I've always known I had a bookin me...
When I turned 40,
I was dropped by my recordcompany as a solo artist,
and that was actuallythe beginning of, like,
soul searchingand what is this all about?
What were The Go-Go's all about?
Who am I?
With sobriety, my world is vastand bigger than it's ever been.
I think for me, there are a lotof ego issues, to be honest,
a lot of slapping downI've needed,
and a lot of...I needed a lot of humbling.
It's five people in this band,
and everybody was seton their own sort of course...
But then we got back together.
Because the story never ends!
The story never ends.
Thank you for coming outtonight.

Hi, there.
Hey.
You know you've got a fair amount of blood on you there, sir.
Oh. Huh.
Yeah, it's not even mine. It was just this...
Never mind.
Hey, listen, I need you to take this thing off my hands,
just make it someone else's problem, you know?
I mean, I thought my boys were gonna love it, but, uh...
Let me tell you, man, they will not.
No, it's not, uh... a toy,
so just don't ever call it that.
It's a, uh...
It's...
Actually, I don't know exactly what it is.
Besides, it appears to be broken.
See, the drumstick seems to be stuck in the up position.
You do not want the goddamn drumstick to come down.
Okay?
Because when it does,
I promise you, we are all fucked to hell.
Okay?
Woah... Oh...
Okay...
Well, sir, can't speak for you,
but, heh, I don't feel especially fucked to hell.
Hot dog.
Who's smiling now, you infernal son of a whore?
YEAH!
I don't know if every father
passes some secret horror onto his kids.
But mine sure did.
My name is Hal Shelborn.
This is me and my twin brother, Bill.
Well, this is us before everything.
Bill was the kind of kid who would say, "shake on it,"
but then pull his hand back and pretend to slick his hair.
He was older than me by three minutes
and ate most of my mom's placenta.
So that made him my "big" brother.
A role he took seriously.
And he treated me like shit whenever he got the chance.
I've been meaning to tell you...
Mom says she hates you because you made dad leave,
and now she has to go on dates.
But I managed to love him anyway,
even if I did sometimes fantasize
about being an only child.
I hate you, Bill Shelborn.
My mom raised us on her own
for as long as she could, at least.
And my mom,
well, I can remember her perfectly,
like it was yesterday.
Your father...
Well, your father went out for a pack of cigarettes
and never came back.
Just made like an egg and...
scrambled.
And sure, sure,
I could have been one of his stewardesses, but,
of course, the deadbeat never took me anywhere.
He just brought back
Swiss cuckoo clocks and bonsai trees.
Knick-knacks and souvenirs
to stuff our closet full.
And one day, my darling boys,
all that horse shit will be yours.
We knew my mom thought it was a bunch of junk.
But for Bill and me,
Dad's closet was full of clues to who he was.
There she is.
Old deadbeat's disguise.
The hell's that thing from?
Paris, France or something?
It says, "Organ Grinder Monkey."
"Like Life."
You mean "lifelike," dumbshit.
No.
What?
Give me that thing.
Here.
You think this does junk if I turn this?
Don't, Bill. It's Dad's.
Dad's gone, fuckface.
And I'm his next of "skin,"
so legally, everything in here's mine.
Stupid thing's broken anyway.
Don't come in our room, dumbshit.
Shotgun, obviously.
Christ, what's worse than a blind date?
I'd rather take my chances
and kiss a goddamn frog and see what happens.
Okay, boys!
Uh, no soda after you brush your teeth,
and no fires,
and no video games because of the last fire.
I tried to tell them no fires,
but these boys are nothing but willish.
Thank you, babysitter Annie.
I'll be home by midnight.
Okay, boys,
I've got only one rule for tonight.
Keep your hands off the hot parts of the table.
Okay?
I'll try, but...
I'm just a man.
Bill, knock it off.
Holy sh--
Maybe an experience like that
could have brought me and Bill closer.
But it turned out one freak tragedy
wasn't going to be nearly enough.
Fuck.
How is her head still together?
Sh. Sh. Sh.
Don't think about it too much.
Oh, fuck.
Uuuuhhh...
Oh, yeah.
Today, we are here with Annie Wilkes.
Gone by accident...
rather, in an accident
because, you know, there's no accidents.
Um... Is there a divine plan?
Sure, you know, uh, maybe.
Call it a coin toss, you know, heads or tails, heh.
But not Annie's head
because that is,
uh, separate.
That's a separate issue. Uh...
Uh... You know, why her, though, right?
Why Annie?
Why not you?
Or you?
Everything for a reason, yeah, totally.
And it is what it is.
Uuuhhh...
It is what it is.
The word of the Lord.
Amen.
Everything is an accident.
Or nothing is an accident.
Either way, same thing.
It's not if or even how.
It's only when.
Everybody dies.
And that's life.
I'll die.
And you will both die.
And all of your friends and their parents
and all of their pets and everybody.
Some of us peacefully in our sleep.
And some of us horribly...
violently, tied up with a clothesline,
and screaming through duct tape over our mouths
and all that jazz.
And to hell with it.
Come on, let's go dancing.
It might have been on the day of a funeral,
but that probably was the happiest day of my life.
It's funny how quickly that can change.
Hey, kid.
Your brother says your dad left your mom.
Lit out to Paris, France to buy cigarettes
'cause you're a big fat baby who cried all the time.
And man, don't your mom deserve better?
I mean, don't she?
-Um... -I guess that means
your mom would be wearing the pants in the house now, huh?
I think that's how it works, yeah.
Aw, but...
see, you're wearing pants.
And two people can't be wearing
the pants in the house at the same time.
So, looks like you got yourself a bit of a pants problem, kid.
Honey, I'm making PB&J.
Oh, and how am I?
Oh, I'm great! I love slaving over my two sons all day long.
Mom!
Yeah?
Why'd you put Dad's weird monkey in our room?
You know I don't go in there anymore
since I found that stiff sock.
Oh, yeah.
You didn't have anything to do
with my babysitter's head, right?
-That'd be like-- -Yo!
You really got the hots for that thing, huh?
-I--I don't. -It's all good.
You can have it, but...
all you gotta do is say you wanna marry it.
But I don't wanna marry it.
Say, "I wanna be Mrs. Stupid Monkey."
I wanna be Mrs. Stupid Monkey.
Now say...
"I wanna suck its banana."
-No, Bill, no. -Say it!
Or I'll eat the rest of your placenta, bitch.
I wanna suck its banana.
All right. We have a deal.
You can have the monkey.
Idiot.
Between the ages of 12 and 15,
the penis takes on a life of its own
and becomes sensitive
to physical and emotional horseplay.
Around this time,
the opposite sex becomes both appealing and horrifying.
Yo, Mrs. Torrance!
Hal Shelborn's jerking his monkey under his desk!
Honey, I'm making devil's food.
I don't fucking want any!
Language!
What are you, a sailor in a shipyard?
You.
It's because of you that deadbeat Bill this to me.
You know who I'm talking about, don't you?
That asshole kid who lives in here with me...
that's Bill.
You wanna know something else?
I wish Bill was dead.
Hey, Mom, you home?
Is dinner ready?
Mom?
Mom?
You're not even making it yet?
What the fuck?!
Oh, shit.
MOMMY!
The doctors called what happened to my mom
a boomerang aneurysm.
But I was the only one who knew what it really was.
They said chances of it happening
were one in 44 million.
And that's just another way to say
it has to happen to somebody.
And that's how it works.
You turn the key and the drumsticks go up.
They come down again when it chooses
who it wants to kill next.
It kills who it wants when it feels like it.
And it doesn't owe you an explanation.
It doesn't take requests.
It's true what it says on the box.
It's just like life.
-perhaps it's best if you-- -Shut up!
Hey, Mom!
Mom, wake up!
Mom?
Mom, that's a funny joke!
MOM!
Wake up.
Okay, you can keep talking.
Oh...
You know, your Aunt Ida and your Uncle Chip...
never wanted kids.
Nah.
Always just kind of preferred a life where you sit down
and you don't stand up again until you want to.
Also, we're swingers, but...
Oh, well.
And I want you to know
we're gonna do our very best with you boys.
It's just that our very best might be...
pretty bad.
Oh... oh, fuck.
Fuck!
What the fuck?
Fuck.
I put the pieces in a garbage bag
and made sure it got on a garbage truck.
And I assumed that would be the end of it.
But after that,
Bill and I were never the same.
I mean, we looked the same because we were twins,
and, well, you know what I mean.
Aunt Ida and Uncle Chip picked up Bill and me
and moved us to Maine.
And I guess I hoped we'd left the worst of it behind us.
You going to take off your suit, Bill?
If I take it off, then I'll have to put it back on
as soon as there's another funeral.
But if I don't take it off,
then I won't have to put it back on.
So there won't be any more funerals.
Sleep tight, you two.
Here comes trouble, here it comes!
Why the hell did you bring it?
I didn't. I chopped it up.
Don't look chopped up to me.
I'm telling you, Bill,
it's a bad monkey.
It's a bad, magic, killer monkey.
You think it killed Babysitter Annie?
Maybe. Probably. I--I don't know.
I was going to marry that girl.
I know you were, Bill.
We should try it on purpose to see if anyone else we know dies.
No, we shouldn't. I mean, what if it gets one of us?
Then I promise to pretend to be sad when you're dead.
Yeah, me too.
You think it could kill the person who turns the key or not?
How the hell should I know?
Do you think Mom turned it?
I'm gonna try it.
Don't, Bill--
It was a hunting accident, but not the usual kind.
Uncle Chip was trampled by a stampede of 67 wild horses
in his sleeping bag on a camping trip.
I overheard the undertaker say that,
when they dumped the body out,
it looked like someone had drop-kicked a cherry pie.
I don't mind much that Uncle Chip's gone.
He was kind of an asshole.
I just mind more that I feel pretty good it wasn't me.
But it's got to be done, you know?
To keep it away from the people
who might feel really good about using it,
like the Nazis and Russians
and "Iran-qis" and whatnot.
We knew that it couldn't be destroyed,
so we hoped that we could maybe contain it.
Just get rid of it.
Make it go the fuck away.
And for a long time, anyway,
it really seemed like it had.
I haven't seen the monkey since we threw it down the well,
but it feels like only a matter of time before it comes back.
This is me today.
I pretty much lost all contact with Bill,
and I'm good with that.
He was kind of an asshole anyways.
I don't have any friends,
and I do my best to stay away from family
for fear that if the monkey returns,
it'll kill someone close to me.
But staying away from family,
Excuse me!
...that's easier said than done.
Well, fuck your mother!
Hey, Dwayne.
-Oh, man! Come in, come in.
Oh no, it's cool.
I gotta run early today. I gotta pick up my kid.
Wait, you got a kid?
Shit, man, that sucks.
Does it live with you?
Uh, no, no he doesn't,
but I get to see him once a year,
so I'm taking him to Horror Heaven.
Roller coasters, I guess.
Once a year?
Shit, man, that sucks.
I bet your ex-wife's some type of mega bitch, huh?
Oh! No, the once-a-year thing, that was my idea.
It turns out I'm kind of a bad influence, you know.
"Here comes trouble."
Who, you?
It's not like, you know,
I beheld a pale horse, and on it was a pale rider,
and the rider's name was, you know, Death.
But, uh...
Yeah, there has been some death.
Shit, man, that sucks.
Pff! Jet skis, come on. Douchebag.
"Love... Hal."
Fuck.
Feel that parental energy...
transferred from you to me.
Petey's been asking about you more and more, Hal.
And it's breaking our hearts.
About me?
What about me? Why?
Because you're his father.
And he's doing a family tree school project.
And like it or not, you're one of the branches.
Look, I--
I care about Petey.
I do. Like, I...
I care about him a lot, like, a lot, lot.
Just now, when we were on the couch together,
I took your power.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I never said you could take my power.
It doesn't matter anymore.
Ted has decided
-to legally adopt Petey. -What?
And once the adoption's finalized...
it won't be necessary for you to see Petey at all.
But you can't just do that.
He can't just do that.
As the leading expert in my field,
can't I?
Listen, you and Petey have this time.
So just take the week,
lock in some nice memories,
and then cleanly cut it off.
Like a vestigial tail.
That's what you want. Isn't it?
No. It's not what I want.
I want to spend time with Petey. It's just, you know...
Vestigial?
It means something that has become functionless,
and as a result, is no longer necessary.
-I know what it means, Ted. -I'm sure you do.
-I do. -Well, I have your power, so...
Well, I peed in one of your bushes on the way in, so...
Well, this is the part where I suggest that we arm wrestle.
What? Arm wrestle for what?
For all the marbles.
And by marbles, I am, of course, referring to your little balls.
-My-- -Hey.
Honey...
Oh, Petey. Hey.
Hey, buddy.
What are you guys talking about?
What do you mean,
it reminds you of your dad?
You talking about the shit-eating grin
or the hairy back and arms?
Do you ever wonder where he is?
Dad, I mean.
Baby, that ain't worth it.
But if you're really looking for an answer,
I'd have to go with either...
at a card table or under a hooker.
Oh, sick, Ma. Come on.
Gross.
Hey, Beauchamps, honey,
you want a drag?
But are you still thinking of selling that monkey thing
to the nut who never leaves his house?
I mean, have you ever even met this guy face to face?
Sounds like a real fucking pervert to me.
So, do you have any brothers or sisters?
Is that your family tree thing?
What gave it away?
Okay.
So, um...
brothers, sisters?
Yes, no?
Uh... no.
No to both?
Yeah, no, neither.
Only child... just like me.
And, uh, what's your mom's name?
Um...
Lois.
My mom's name was...
Lois.
Hey, uh... Oof.
It's getting kind of late, darn.
I should get you some, uh, some dinner, huh?
Only if you want me to, like, survive.
Cool.
Say it, or I'll eat the rest of your placenta...
I promise to pretend to be sad
when you're dead.
What the fuck?!
Christ.
What the fuck?
Hello.
Well, hello, dumbshit.
Bill.
Can't be the only person who calls you dumbshit.
How did you know how to reach me, Bill?
I haven't heard from you in, what, five years?
Haven't seen you in something like 10?
Nine and eleven, and those are just numbers.
The police gave me yours.
What do you mean, the police?
I have news.
Aunt Ida is no more.
Oh, shit.
Well, I guess she was kind of old.
Was she sick or something?
Actually, it seems the old girl
was having somewhat of a renaissance,
putting her house on the market, cleaning out her closet.
The nice young policewoman I spoke to...
used the phrase, "freak accident."
Okay, and? What?
Someone has to go through her belongings,
and you're the next of kin.
Technically, you're the next of kin, Bill.
This is my week with Petey, so no.
Your week? That's all you get with your son?
-Also, you're weak. -What do you want, Bill?
Go to Aunt Ida's house and make sure "it" isn't there.
"It" is at the bottom of a well.
"It" can teleport and you know it.
Why don't you bring Petey along, hmm?
Let him see you being brave for a change.
What do fathers and their estranged sons
say to each other?
Road trip?
Why would it be at Aunt Ida's anyway?
Because it's attached itself to our family
and likes to kill us.
And I don't want to die, and presumably
you don't want Petey to die either.
And what if I find it, huh?
What am I supposed to do,
drop it from a fucking plane? It'll probably bounce!
No, you never let it out of your sight again,
so no one turns the key.
Presumably you don't want Petey to--
Stop talking about Petey.
The monkey must be vanquished.
Why don't you vanquish it, huh, Bill?
You're smaller, you go.
Bill. Bi... Fuck!
Fuck!
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
Fuck! What the fuck?
Is that a leg? Fuck!
Okay, okay.
-Petey, wake up. Come on. -What?
-We gotta go. Let's go. -What time is it?
What the fuck?
Hey, language.
And we gotta go, all right?
There was a thing outside.
It wasn't a thing.
It was a woman, and either way, we gotta split.
All right? So come on, let's go.
It's the middle of the night. Are you high?
No, I wish, Jesus Christ.
No, don't do drugs. I mean it.
But come on, let's go. Hurry up.
I'm going to bed.
WE GOTTA MAKE LIKE EGGS AND SCRAMBLE!
Hey, Petey, uh... sorry about that.
It's just that my aunt Ida died,
and I gotta deal with a lot of her stuff.
Can I ask you a question?
I'd really rather you didn't.
How'd your mom die?
Is this for your family tree thing?
Because usually family trees are about the whos
and the whens, not the whys and the, you know, how.
Was your aunt the one that raised you after your mom died?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, she did.
Maybe you could, uh,
take me to your aunt's house with you.
I could help you with her stuff and--
You're not coming with me, Petey.
Why not?
Because it's depressing, all right?
We were supposed to go to a theme park,
not into, you know...
...darkness and death.
I know about the adoption, Hal.
Oh.
And so you can either just...
cut me off and cut this off,
or we can spend
the rest of the little time that we have left together...
together.
I wonder which one Lois would have chosen.
What are you doing in here all alone, Hal?
Or do I not want to know?
Just thinking, I guess.
Oh, yeah?
-About what? -I don't know.
The future.
You got any advice?
Um, well...
take care of your teeth.
And take care of your gut.
And take life as it comes.
You know, the worst thing you can do is try to force it.
But really, I think that the most important thing
for you to remember is...
try not to kill everybody around you.
Petey? Pe...
Petey?
Petey?
Hey, Petey, buddy?
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Check it out. There's a place in town.
They do skydiving lessons.
I feel like it's one of those things
where you're either really good at it or you aren't.
It only takes one lesson to find out.
Hey, funny.
That's... that's funny.
Yeah? Well, you're kind of funny too, Hal.
Oh, and they do weddings.
Hey, uh, do me a favor, all right?
Uh, wait in the car while I deal with this.
What? No way.
I want to see your old room like they do in the movies.
No, Petey.
Why not?
Just because... because I said so.
All right. Fine.
Then I have to go number two.
What? Why didn't you go at the motel?
There's a lot you don't know about me, Hal.
For instance,
I'm one of those kids that can only go poo in a house.
Are you being serious?
It's a tough bet to lose, Hal.
Jesus Christ.
Hi.
Hey there. Sorry. Ah.
Oh, window won't go down.
-Yeah, okay. -Hey there.
-How are you? -Hi! I'm Barbara.
-Hi. -You must be Hal Shelborn.
Your brother Bill Shelborn said you'd be coming.
Oh, yeah, right, right.
Uh, hi, Barbara. Yeah.
That brother Bill of yours
is quite the character, isn't he?
-Yeah. -Your brother Bill, I mean!
Yes, yes. He's quite the character. Yeah.
Yeah. Wow, who's this little slugger?
Oh, this is, uh, this is my son, Petey.
Oh, hello there.
Oh, no, thanks, Barbara.
I'm just a kid who doesn't buy many houses.
But I also didn't know that I have an uncle.
So, yeah, thanks for that.
Um, it's funny, because I actually asked Hal here
if he had any siblings yesterday.
But he flat out lied to my face.
-Well... -But it's cool.
He's only going to be my dad for, like,
a few more days anyway,
'cause he's being swapped out for a leading expert.
-Yeah. -Okay.
-Well... -So no card. Okay.
-No card, yeah. -Let's see the house.
Were you and your aunt very close?
Uh, sure. Very.
Is this all her stuff?
I felt like she had more stuff.
Oh, well, we did have that estate sale
the day after she died.
We had a great turnout, too.
We must have made over $100, ha!
Right...
Okay.
Now, let's see, that would have been on Sunday,
because ever since Monday,
things have been a bit, uh, messy around here.
Yeah. Your aunt, of course, was Monday.
And then, oh Lord,
first thing Tuesday, it was Mitch McDonald.
And then Wednesday was Burt Burgerson.
And then Nancy Risoli.
But there aren't any cobras in Maine, I mean, are there?
Well, there was the one.
No, every day since Monday,
at least one Casco local has just... poof!
Sometimes two or three or four
or even five Casco locals have just poof...
-Right. OK. -And poof and poof!
Great, yeah, yeah, no, I get it.
Could we look at the other closet? It's this way, I think.
Absolutely, follow me.
You're fucking twins?
You know, my mother used to always say
whenever there was a plane crash
or a school bus going off into the river
and mass fatalities or what have you...
She used to always say,
"Looks like God's bowling strikes tonight."
Oh, that's odd.
I don't remember locking this.
Hey, you wouldn't happen to remember
if my aunt had a wind-up toy monkey at the yard sale?
Oh, no, I don't think so.
Oh, not a cherished childhood memory, now, was it?
Oh, a first little furry friend
filled with whimsy and wonder?
No, it's no big deal. Thanks.
Okay.
Nope, not that one.
How are we doing with that key?
Oh... Don't you worry your pretty little head.
Oh mercy, did I say that out loud?
Watch out!
You are pretty, though.
-Oh! -You know what?
-I think we should go down... -It looks like I did
my own little process of elimination!
No, no, no!
Everything okay up there?
Yeah, everything's fine.
Oh, fuck.
And you were just standing there,
hands to yourself, is that right?
Yeah, that's right.
And you knew there was a gun in the house, or not so much?
Uh, no.
Okay.
I'm gonna have to ask you don't leave town
until we can figure a few things out.
What? No, no, no, officer.
I promised my son that I was gonna take him
-to Horror Heaven. -Actually, officer,
we moved off going to Horror Heaven.
This is obviously far more important.
-Smart kid. -Hmm.
Find a motel.
I'd say stay here, but it's a goddamn mess in there.
I mean, have you actually been up there?
It's like that restaurant...
Spaghetti City.
Hey, bud, you wanna go wait in the car?
Yeah, that's your favorite thing for me to do anyway, isn't it?
Just stay away.
They're bringing the body out!
Let's go, Casco! Let's go, Casco! Let's go!
Hello?
Hal Shelborn, please, if he's available.
-Bill? -Thank goodness.
And Petey? Is he available, too?
Yeah, look, we're fine, but, um...
The monkey's not here.
Aunt Ida had a goddamn yard sale, so it could've been,
but now it could be anywhere with anyone.
Well, that's not good. That's bad.
Yeah, there's all kinds of shit happening in town,
people dying in not normal ways.
Police told me I can't leave.
Go to the motel. Await my signal.
Await your fucking signal?!
Wait, Bill, where are you?
Bill, are you living in town?
Stupid.
Shelborn , Shelborn... Argh. Nope.
"Mrs. Monkey"?
Hello.
If this is in regards to my ad,
I'm happy to report that my quest
for finding my beloved toy monkey is over.
Thank you for calling and be safe out there.
At the very moment you slipped from my fingers,
I suddenly knew the terrible truth about everything.
That my dumbshit brother
had turned your key and killed my mom.
So I went back to get you as soon as I could.
But you were gone.
Leaving behind a sign for me and only me.
That one day, you'd be back.
And so I waited.
And for the longest time,
there was nothing.
A hundred percent, pure, medical-grade nothingness.
But then...
there you were.
Suddenly, everywhere I looked, you were there.
As constant as the sun, the moon, and the stars.
As if you had always been looking down on me.
Letting me know what I had always wanted to be true.
That you'd come back to help me seek my revenge.
I returned to the places where I thought you might be.
Foolishly believing that I could make you appear again.
Fuck.
That it was I who might find you again.
So I made myself ready for your return.
Reworking my old childhood funeral suit
in anticipation of...
more funerals.
And so that I might once again
bear witness to your terrible glory.
Fuck!
So I looked, and behold, a pale horse,
and his name that sat on him was Death.
Mrs. Monkey.
And now, here we are.
Together at last.
With only one thing left to do.
In your infinite wisdom,
I trust your flaming sword of righteousness
will cut the foul air
and smite the right person.
And I know you know exactly who I'm talking about.
Shit, man, that sucks.
Shit, man, that sucks! Ah!
What?
Um, uh, it's Ricky.
What is it? I'm extremely busy.
Okay, yeah, so...
I hope this isn't weird, but I was wondering,
you know, if maybe I could give you your 15 bucks back
and instead I could just keep the toy monkey thing.
It's not a toy, don't ever call it that.
Right, yeah, no, I thought the same thing too.
It just sort of makes me think about my dad,
which I know is kind of a weird thing
for, like, a guy to say, like, to another guy.
Does it hurt very much when you think, Ricky?
-Well-- -"Uh... Well, well..."
Did you know that 27% of all English-speaking people
will either say, "oh, shit" or "holy shit" before they die?
Now it's funny, because death
is the one big thing that'll happen to all of us,
and yet we still can't help but be somehow surprised by it.
Right on, man.
So anyway,
I saw your brother.
He looks like you.
With that's, like, uh...
that's, like, your nephew then, huh?
What if Petey turned the key?
So... so, can I have it back?
Never. I employed you to find the monkey,
not to fall in love with it.
Now fuck off.
Fuck you...
Hey, Ma, are you home or are you at the factory?
Lousy deadbeat.
Yo, Beauchamps!
You got any extra bullets?
What caliber?
Hey, you still got some of Barbara's blood on you.
Yeah.
Accidents happen.
Can I ask you a question?
Ha ha.
Uh, nope.
You ever killed a man?
I...
Jesus.
Does Mom know?
No, I haven't killed anybody.
Of course I haven't killed anybody.
Look, when we get back to the motel, I'm gonna call your mom
and I'm gonna tell her what happened.
She'll think I'm not safe to be around and...
she'll be right.
So Ted will just adopt me and...
you'll never have to see me again?
You're better off with Ted, all right?
Fuck you, man.
Hey, Petey...
Well, I'm here if you need me.
You just do your thing in the bathroom, okay?
And if you wanna have a talk,
we can have a proper talk, all right, buddy?
Yes?
It's me. You have it, don't you?
I don't know, maybe.
Come on, Bill, Mrs. Monkey?
I know you are, but what am I?
Stop turning the key!
Its arms aren't fucking long enough or articulate enough
to reach back there itself, so somebody has to.
And also, no.
Jesus fucking Christ, Bill,
these are innocent people.
Look, I... I don't care about me.
All that matters is that Petey is safe, so stop turning it.
If you want me to stop turning the key,
bring Petey to me so he can turn it instead.
What? No. Why?
The person who turns the key never dies.
You've known that since we were kids, haven't you, Hal?
What?
What are you talking about?
Where are you, Bill?
If you want Petey to be safe,
all Petey has to do is turn the key
and keep turning the key forever and ever and ever,
and Petey will never die.
Listen to me, Bill, all right?
Let me get Petey out of here, then we'll talk, all right?
We'll figure out what we're gonna do.
Either I keep turning the key or Petey turns the key.
Call me back when you made your decision.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Bill, Bi--
Fuck!
Hey, Petey? Petey?
Hey, Petey?
Hey, buddy, we gotta go, all right?
I gotta take you back to your mom's.
Petey, open the door! Come on!
Petey!
Petey, open the door!
Come on, we gotta go right now!
Jesus Christ.
Don't have a heart attack.
Or do, you know? You want out of my life so bad,
it might just be a nice shortcut.
Petey, what the fuck? Why didn't you answer the door?
Why do you care? Why would you even have a kid
if all you're gonna do is just keep yourself away from me?
I didn't exactly know what I was doing, all right?
I was just a stupid, dumb kid.
So I was an accident? Is that what you're saying?
Everything is an accident, yes.
Wow, nice one.
Great to hear.
I... That's not what I...
Yes, it was an accident, Petey.
But you are not a mistake.
I'm so glad you're here with me.
You're very precious to me.
But that's why I stay away, because I...
I come with all sorts of weird baggage,
and I don't want you to have to deal with that.
-Like what? -Like...
Bad stuff, Petey, like...
like evil stuff.
Stuff I got from my dad, and I don't want to pass it on to you.
What are you talking about? Like what?
Like...
Hold on.
Open up, it's the motherfucking police!
All right, all right.
Shut up! Shut up and hands up!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Just relax, all right?
-Sh, sh! -Just relax, relax.
-Get the keys. -What?
-COME ON! -Okay, okay!
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
All right, all right.
We're gonna go for a little drive, okay?
Okay, all right.
All right, stop here.
Where are we?
Huh?
Where are we?
That's your brother's house!
Or his fortress.
Don't pretend like you don't know where we are!
I don't know, all right?
We're, you know, we're estranged.
-Ah, shit, man, that sucks. -Thanks.
-Shut up! -Okay.
You, you go inside,
you make nice with your uncle, you get me the monkey.
-And you bring it out, okay? -What monkey?
It's... It's got a little red vest,
and it holds a drum, and I need it.
Why does this guy know about a monkey and I don't?
He doesn't know about it and he's not going in there.
It's a toy monkey?
Don't call it that, all right?
It's not. It's...
It's evil.
It's basically the devil, all right?
It's a toy monkey.
I was gonna tell you when you were older, okay?
You've been a goddamn deadbeat dad because of a toy monkey?
What the fuck?
Hey, language, and yes, but that's why we have to get
as far away from this place as possible.
Seriously, kid, you gotta hope you get that goddamn monkey,
because I'm gonna shoot this guy.
All right, just let me go in there with him.
-Please. -No!
There is a doggy door around back,
and your kid better hope that he's scrawny enough to fit.
You don't call the cops or do anything.
You get in there, you get me the monkey,
or I swear I'm gonna shoot you both, like, a lot of times.
He's not going in there.
-Shut up! -All right.
Go.
Hal...
this is some fucked up shit.
I know.
So whatever you do,
don't turn the key in the monkey's back.
Okay, okay!
Fuck...
Fuck.
Huh.
Kinda cool... I guess.
You're not really a cop, are you?
Shut up! Of course not.
I hate cops.
My dad was a cop.
Still is, for all I know.
You know, my mom said he was out chasing pussy,
but I'm all like, there's pussy here in town, you know?
-Yeah, I know. -But whatever.
He left.
And that's why I hate cops.
But also they're cops, you know?
Which is the best reason to hate cops.
What the fuck?
Uh...
What the hell is that doing there?
Hit it with your brights.
Hit it with my brights, okay.
Oh, gross! Shut it off!
-Okay! -Shut it off!
I'm shutting it off. Jesus!
In your infinite wisdom,
I trust your flaming sword of righteousness
will cut the foul air and strike the right person
and only the right person.
Uncle Bill?
Petey.
What a nice surprise.
-You okay? -Who, me?
Yeah.
You.
It's been a long time since anyone's asked me that.
Now that you mention it...
No.
I'm not okay.
This was my favorite toy from childhood.
It's supposed to play the drums, but I think it's stuck.
Could you fix it for me?
It was your grandfather's, you know.
He brought it home from one of his trips.
He was a pilot.
He was a Petey too.
Did you know that?
-Hal never tells me anything. -No, of course, he doesn't.
So this is it then, huh?
The thing that messed everyone up?
How could it?
It's just a toy.
Why don't you try turning it, hmm?
Probably just needs a different touch.
There.
Turning the key is just simply something
the Shelborn men have been doing for generations.
It's a... A tradition, if you will.
But if it's not for you, then it's not for you.
What does it do?
Turn the key.
See what happens.
You want me to back up?
No! Don't fucking move.
Hey, okay. Okay.
Is it working?
Man, this stupid cop hat!
It's crazy itchy.
What?
Jesus fucking Christ!
Let's be careful with that pistol, huh?
Yeah.
-Totally. -Yeah. Right.
Fuck.
Holy shit!
-Shit! Shit! -Oh!
Jesus Christ! Fuck!
Fuck! Jesus!
FUCK!
Fuck!
What the fuck?!
Fuck.
PETEY, WHERE ARE YOU?!
-Dad! -Petey!
Turn it again.
Turn the goddamn key right now!
What? No!
Then give me the fucking monkey!
That's it!
I'm not asking nicely anymore.
Do it. Kill him.
Kill my dumb shit brother, and do it now!
God... damn you!
Strike the goddamn drum!
God-fucking...
I command you!
Fuck.
Godd... Will you, please?
Goddamn it!
Godd...
How are you so goddamn strong?
Hey!
Huh? Petey!
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Ah, thank God. Come on.
God... damn it!
What did I do wrong?
What is that?
Jesus Christ!
What the...
Bill.
Fuck. The drumstick's still up, Petey.
Hello, dumbshit.
That's all you can say at a time like this, you fucker?!
Dumbshit's what you are.
Fuck... You fuck!
Jesus Christ, Bill.
You were really trying to kill me, weren't you?
Of course I was.
That's what all this carnage was for, huh?
You could've killed Petey!
You could've killed my fucking son!
For what? Why?
'Cause you killed my mom.
And I know you wanted to kill me.
But the goddamn thing doesn't take requests, obviously.
I've been turning the key with you in mind for days.
Nothing.
Listen, Bill.
It's not my fault.
It wasn't anybody's fault.
None of us deserved what happened to us.
We just happened to be there when it did.
Mommy?
I'm sorry, Bill.
But I guess I gotta go now.
Everybody dies, and that's life.
I'm sorry your mom died.
It fucking sucks.
I know how you feel.
She was my mom, too.
Oh, yeah.
I guess she was.
Never thought about it like that.
Innocent mistake, I guess.
Sure.
Makes sense, though, you know.
We're brothers.
Twins.
Right.
I'm sorry.
I wish we could have been there for each other
when we were kids.
But we're here now.
What do you say, Bill?
Brothers again?
Sure.
Nah...
I'm sorry.
So what, you two are on some kind of road trip or something?
Yeah.
A kind of...
father-son road trip, right?
Cool.
I would like to have done that
with somebody at least once.
So come with us.
Jesus!
Fuck.
So Uncle Bill pretty much
wiped out half the town where you grew up, huh?
Yeah.
I mean, I get that everybody dies,
and that's life, but...
it's just, like, everybody dies,
you know, at the same time.
So, uh...
what do you want to do now?
I guess we gotta figure out what we're gonna do with the monkey.
We keep it close.
We accept that it's ours...
and we hold on tight.
Hey, I just got an idea of what we should do right now.
Let's go dancing.
-Dancing? -Yeah.
Like, with our bodies?
Where did that shit come from?
It comes from your grandmother.
From Lois.
Cool.
Yeah, it is cool.

From NewYork, 'The Tonight Show,'
starring Johnny Carson.
And now, here's
the fabulous Harry Belafonte.
Here he comes!
The strong gets more
While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don'tever make the grade
I found out about thatweek from Harry Belafonte.
I went over to his home
and all of a sudden,effortlessly,
he started talking aboutthis week of television
and 'The Tonight Show.'
And I'm thinking, wait aminute,
Harry Belafonte hosted aweek of "The Tonight Show?"
What?
What, how did I not know this?
- That was probably themost revolutionary move
that mainstream televisioncould have done at the time.
That's right the woman issmarter
That's right
- I write about TV, Iwrite about politics.
I should have known about it.
Why is this history lost tous?
That's right
Harry Belafonte takes anexisting white institution
in American cultureand he turns it into
something thatrepresents hisworld,
that it should bemulticultural,
that it should bepolitically engaged.
What Harry Belafonte did,
he combined politicsand entertainment.
Like a forerunnerto 'The Daily Show'
and the Stephen Colbert show.
Is that a fancy wayof saying I told you so?
I mean, this is early 1968.
The nation was reallyin crazy upheaval.
There was increasing andvery appropriate Black anger.
And Harry exposedyou as a white person,
speaking as a white person,
to this vibrant worldwhere Black people
and white peoplemet as equals.
This was a talented,intelligent, sophisticated,
passionate socialactivist of a Black man
in that chair that has,through the years,
been the seat of white males.
My parents allowed meto stay up late.
They said,you need to see this.
I guarantee you, mygrandmother had her three kids
sitting in theliving room watching,
even though theyshould have been in bed.
It was something thatwas really inspiring,
especially to a lot of Blackpeople who were watching,
who had not seen themselvesnecessarily represented
in that way,in that American institution
that is 'The Tonight Show'.
Harry Belafonte at11 o'clock late night
was saying, we're here,we're Americans.
We're part of this,we're not going anywhere.
Y'all brought us,now we're here.
So, get in your bed.
Let me be the last thing yousee before you go to sleep.
Mr. Belafonte,would you like to look at
your guest listfrom that week?
I'd love to see it.
Oh, my God.
I had all these people?
When I was there I was a bitoverawed by the whole thing.
It was so seldom in the'60s that people of color
were invited intothe homes of, you know,
television viewers everywhere.
First time on 'TheTonight Show,' I'm scared.
I'm sitting between HarryBelafonte and Paul Newman.
That was a special night.
I knew I was withthe biggies that night.
Me, too.
As they say, steppingin high cotton.
You see how pivotalthis week was
because you're watchingthis man bring together
all of his brothers andsisters in the movement
and say we deserve a spaceand we deserve to be here
and we deserve totalk about these things.
From NewYork, 'The Tonight Show,'
starring Johnny Carson.
'The Tonight Show' wasone of the most powerful
platforms of communicationin the world.
If there's anything youdon't see, just ask for it.
Okay, we have, fine,a gentleman.
Johnny Carson was therage of the evening.
Thank you, love you all.
If anybody was upafter 10 o'clock,
they were watching'The Tonight Show.'
One, two.
Jump in anyway.
Yah!
Mr. Woody Allen.
Carson would oftenmention this on the air.
'Hey, I know you're in bedwhen you're watching me.'
And it's the most unique offrames to watch television
was between your feet.
You're taking themnot just in your home,
but actuallyinto your bedroom.
The birth ratein this country has
dropped appreciablyand I'd like to feel
that my showis partly responsible.
Carson was thisMidwestern very,
sort of easy totake kind of host.
Hi, folks.
He was as averageof an American
as you could possibly get.
We'll be right back.
It was part of his appeal.
He was just the kid next door.
Never seen a human cell.
Johnny Carson helped definewhat late night would be.
Early on the 1950s,'60s, as we really started
to see these interviewprograms with Jack Paar
and all thesesorts of people...
See, they don'tunderstand what, uh,
how we do the show.
We just keep talking
with no script.I know.
It's agony.
You would getto see celebrities
as you've neverseen them before.
You get to seethem uncensored.
So that started makinglate night really special
and hallowed ground.
Why did you go into politics?
I think that asan interested citizen
in the United States,
I cannot thinkof a greater privilege
than serving inthe House or the Senate.
Tonight!
When 'TheTonight Show' first began,
it was a comedy show and SteveAllen became the first host.
This is uh,kind of a mild little show.
I don't expect you to say,'Boy, what a program!'
Carson takes overin October of 1962
and it really is a whole
different approachto the show.
He managed to weavein more contemporary news
than anybody had tried before.
Senator, Mrs. Kennedy areexpecting their tenth child.
I understandEthel Kennedy is demanding
a civilian review board.
All of that would first bethe subject of a monologue.
And then often guestswould talk about it.
Our bloodshed will bein our racial situation,
not with Russia or Khrushchevor any other country.
But you probably, as mostpeople do in the world today,
have some feelings onthe Vietnam situation.
And theinteresting thing about
'The Tonight Show'
was that the guestsstayed on the couch.
They didn't just maketheir appearance and leave.
So they sat together.
I wish now I'dhave been honest.
So, 'The Tonight Show'now becomes
kind of a nationalgathering place at night.
And whatever's goingon in pop culture,
whatever's goingon in politics,
obviously what'sgoing on in the news,
it was a place for allthose things to come together
in an entertaining way.
30 at night, Eastern,was the most segregated hour
in America because whitepeople were watching
white Johnny Carsonin their white homes.
Black people weredoing it separately.
Little Mister 1968.
Let's welcome him.
Tell me, 1968, whatcan we expect from you?
Well, there's riots,brutality, poverty, sit-ins,
overpopulation, famine.
Hmm, I see.
You want to hear thebad news now?
Hi, this is Johnny Carson.
As you know this isthe usual starting time
for 'The Tonight Show,'
but because of the criticalwar situation in Vietnam,
NBC for the next 15 minutesis going to bring you
a special newsprogram via satellite.
On themorning of January 31st,
both sides claimed victorin the Tet Offensive,
but 1100 Americansoldiers lie dead.
Seven young andearnest protestors
burned draft cardson the steps of...
In 1968,there were many Americas.
There was Black Americaand White America.
For his running mate,
Nixon chose Henry Cabot Lodge.
There wasestablishment America,
anti-establishment America.
And the culture was chaotic.
The culture was complicated.
The culture was divisive.
The tension in the air of1968 couldn't be ignored,
no matter how manyblinders that you chose to
put in front of your eyes.
All kinds of changeswere pushed through.
It's the time when women said,
listen, we're not just this.
We want to runthese companies.
We're not playingwith you anymore.
It's the year of the afro.
Boom!
Natural hair.
Change.
Things were no longergoing to be the status quo.
I never seen no road otherthan the one from here
Well we do it to others
Before them othersdo it to us
It was that time of protests.
The Black community had risenup with righteous indignation.
We could no longer toleratethe racial indiscretions
that were beingheaped upon us.
As performers, we felt a need
to begin to do morethan just sing.
We had to have a point ofview and we had to speak out.
Highway men don'thave to fight
For the thing theycalled a human right
When you lookat the late '60s,
the exposure thatwhite Americans
were getting on the news
was the covering of thecivil rights marches
and the civil rightsmovement that was happening.
Oh time
But we were still watchingshows like 'Bonanza,'
'Beverly Hillbillies,''I Dream of Jeannie.'
Very, very whitetelevision shows.
We were really seeing thesepretty trivial depictions
of the Old West, depictionsof suburban families.
Television shows hada always very difficult
relationship with reality
and there were a lot of,we'll say fantasy sitcoms
that really sortof avoided race
and what was goingon in the country.
My personal experienceshave been that there is
an enormous reluctanceon the part of the media
to expose Black lifeas it really is.
Hollywood reflectsthe mood of the nation.
It reflects our politics.
It reflects our culture.
It reflects our hopesand aspirations.
And it lies a lotabout who we are.
None of us thought we weregoing to be in the future.
If you were a sci-fi person,which I am,
You never saw us represented
in the future timesof America.
For what we are about toreceive, we give thanks.
We were never there.
We were never at thebeach blanket bingo.
Hello?
We hear that the girlsare all over at your house.
We were neverwhere the boys were.
We just weren't there,we weren't represented.
Television was amedium that was still
figuring out its relationshipto power in a lot of ways.
TV wasn't crossover medium.
There were a few Black starsin television at the time
who had been able tokind of rise to the top.
Harry Belafontewas one of those.
Cannonball cometo the judgment
Fare thee wellfare ye well
Here's that greatgift of morning
Fare thee wellfare ye well
Here's that greatgift of morning
Fare thee wellfare ye well
I say let us put manand a woman together
To find out whichone is smarter
Harry Belafonte was ahuge celebrity at the time,
who produced recordsetting album after album.
First performer to sellover a million copies
of a single album.
Woo hawk eyed womanis going out
Every day
What Mr. Belafonte wound updoing was taking the art form
of calypso music.
Won't be backfor many a day
And making it mainstreamfor America's taste.
Had to leave a littlegirl in Kingston town
In the West Indies,there are many languages
that have invadedthose islands.
I mean, the French,the English, the Spanish.
And when it'sall put together,
it comes out in a strangetongue we call Patois.
Just say after me, 'I wonderwhy nobody don't like me.'
I wonder why nobodydon't like me.
By George,I think he's got it.
Yes!
Whoop!
I wonder why nobodydon't like me
Or is it the factthat I'm ugly
I wonder why nobodydon't like me
Or is it the factthat I'm ugly
Harry was also a movie star.
He was a household name.
Black and white.
In your heart,deep down inside,
don't you still thinkof us as slaves?
At night I tell you people
We saw him in iconicfilms like 'Carmen Jones,'
'Bright Road,''Odds Against Tomorrow,'
'Island in the Sun.'
There are other countries.
My skin is my country.
Today we take it for granted,
but in the 1950s,that was a radical idea
to have a Black artisthave a white fan base
at a time in which therewas still legal segregation.
Everybody when the saints
Go marching inOh when the saints go
If you look at someof his early television
musical sort of variety shows,
I mean, there was just afascination and an appeal
that you couldn't find itanywhere else on television.
Not so beautiful
Not one so beautiful
Like my love is
I know when those women,
whatever nationalitythey were,
when they saw Harry,
it was all about
'Cause sexy's sexyno matter what.
When you see her
He was one of the mostimportant and trailblazing
cross-media superstarsof the 20th Century.
There are many sides to thelegend of Harry Belafonte.
Singer, actor, activist.
As artists,we rejoice in the knowledge
that human experiencehas no color
and we believe that artistshave a valuable function
in any society sinceit is the artist
who reveal thesociety to itself.
My father wasa political person
before he became an artist.
His mother wasa political person.
His environment that he grewup in and was exposed to
was political.
He wanted to take everyopportunity that he could
to bring forth thecivil rights movement.
He always usedwhatever platform he had
as an opportunityto educate and motivate
and activate audiences.
Our cause in Americais an honorable cause.
And ofttimes, when we arein the midst of the struggle
for our liberation,we sometimes feel that
it is more than we can bear.
Rosa Parks got me into this.
Went down to meether and I came back
and then one dayI got a phone call.
'Mr. Belafonte?'
I said, 'Yes.'
They said,'You may not know me,
'there's no reason for you to,
'except that I needto talk to you.'
And I said, 'Fine.'
'My name isMartin Luther King Jr.'
He said, 'The thingsyou have said and done,
'I really believe you couldbe an important component
'to this adventurethat I'm embarking on.'
And listening towhat he had to say,
I knew that foreverI'd be in his service.
Ladies and gentlemen, theNobel Peace Prize winner,
the ReverendDr. Martin Luther King.
Once I took up with him,
my life never wentanywhere else but there.
Not only is Harrya great artist,
he is a great humanitarian.
No performing artists in theUnited States or in the world
has raised as much money forthe civil rights movement
as Harry Belafonte.
I respond as oftenas possible to Dr. King
because I believe thesalvation of America
and our potential
is in our capacityto deal humanistically
and non-violentlywith our difficulties.
People who worked withJohnny at the time would say
he was conversant withthe civil rights movement.
I can't sit here and say Iunderstand, because we can't.
He understood manyof the issues,
but he was notcomfortable enough to say
I'm going to doa week of shows
about what's goingon in the country.
So when I was outin Las Vegas,
I did the thing withthe audience, you know,
and the questions,I get questions,
you know, political, whatdo you think of so and so.
And I found out that nomatter which side you go,
you got to end up, if you'rea straight entertainer,
losing half your audience.
He as an entertainerdid not feel like
getting up on the soapbox.
But he certainly supportedthe other entertainers
who were doing that.
I also admire MarlonBrando for his conscience
as an American andhis moral commitment
when he believes in something.
Will you welcome, please,Mr. Marlon Brando.
So I think he thought,
I'm going to havea guest host come on
and the guest host can address
what I think areserious issues.
I do think Carson wastrying to make a statement.
How can you not talk about allthe things that are going on
in the craziest yearin American history?
Even my Midwestern, middleof the country audience,
they need to see this.
This is only six years intoJohnny Carson's tenure,
that he did that.
Goodnight.
See you tomorrow.
So it wasn't doing itfrom the safe harbor of
I'm the King of Late Night.
He was still fairlynew in the job.
But it was in his headthat Harry Belafonte
was the right guy.
I said no at first.
Because I couldn't dowhat Johnny did.
I can't tell jokesand whatnot.
I don't want nobody
We know Harry Belafontehad been burned
by television before.
In 1959, he hadthis special called
'Tonight with Belafonte.'
It was fantastic,it won an Emmy.
And the sponsor,which was Revlon,
actually offered him anongoing series after that.
He called it 'New York, 19.'
Well if it's so I don'twant to be a monkey
I'll go to sleepa mule or donkey
My brother said thathe will come back a hog
Not Harry I thinkI'll be a bedbug
The first episode ranin 1960 to rave reviews.
But when he started toplan the next episode,
the sponsor called him in
and had a problem withthe fact that Harry used
multiracial casts.
And the sponsor toldhim pick a Black cast,
but none of this mixing.
And Harry walked away.
Thank you for being with us.
See you around.
My fatherdidn't always trust
what the outcomes of a certainopportunity might bring.
And so he turned alot of things down.
Tonight we take a lookat Negro humor in America.
We call it 'A Timefor Laughter.'
If it wasn't going tobe in an inclusive way
that he envisioned,
both racially, but Ithink most importantly,
artistically, letalone politically,
he didn't want that tobe part of his legacy.
I believe that'sa bird dog
That sounds likea rabbit dog
Woof woof woof
Oh that's an oldCivil Rights chaser
Being on television,reaching a lot of people,
and having thisamazing opportunity
that might only come oncein your entire lifetime.
And Harry Belafontehad to be convinced.
It was Johnny whoput me at ease and said
we just want youto be who you are.
I said in orderto be who I am,
I'd have to have guests on
that share some of my beliefs.
He agreed to that condition,
with the understanding thatthe network had the right
to say no to anybody.
But they wanted meto submit my list.
After a littlebit of wrangling,
they gave him controlof the guest list,
which was a huge deal.
So was there trepidation?
I'm sure therewas trepidation.
I'm sure therewas trepidation.
And who knowswhat's gonna happen?
Is he going to have, youknow, a mix of people on?
Is it gonna be Blackpeople and White people?
Does he have restrictions?
When you see picturesof the guests,
they didn't justpass each other.
They knew each other.
So I envisioned Mr. Belafonte
making half thosecalls himself,
saying, 'Hey, I needyou to come on by here
'and do this show.'
So he was probably his bookerand the host of the show.
Do youremember how it felt
to be on the show?
I hardly knew what Iwas yesterday,
much less 1968.
But, wow.
That's like,some nice company.
Is he here?
Floyd Bounceris here, friends.
When you werein Selma, Alabama
All of these people, notonly were great artists,
but some of them werealso great thinkers.
It's thebiggest feeling
I ever had in my life
to be actively involved inbeing part of my own times.
He had all types ofpeople on that week,
but like the sheer volumeof activists that he had on
is mind-blowing.
Especially in such apolitical hotbed at the time.
Freedom!
He fights with missilesand with spears
The fact that he wasable to fill in the space
with people that hadsubstance was amazing to me.
And to use that platform,
that's unprecedentedfor the times.
I wanted to bring a politicaldimension to the evening
that was not quite 'TheTonight Show' thing.
I want to make thisannouncement.
So I said, if anybodywants to hear
what Dr. King has to say
and Bobby Kennedy has to say,
it'll be goodfor your ratings.
They were consideredthe spokespersons
for the mood of the nation.
There's a story of somebodywith the network asking,
'Dr. King isn't going to talkabout that civil rights stuff,
'is he?'
It was a silly question.
We've got him here.
What would you likehim to do, sing a song?
Ladies and gentlemen,the Reverend Dr. MartinLuther King.
How old were youwhen you started the
Montgomery Alabama Montgomery,Alabama bus strike?
Well, I was 27 at thattime, that was back in 1956.
Can I ask one other question?
After this uh, wordfrom your local station.
Harry had an agenda.
And he had the peopleto back it up.
The winner is Sidney Poitier.
Harry hadSidney Poitier,
who by '68 was the biggestmovie star in Hollywood.
There's a good angellooking after me somewhere.
Sidney was pushing backagainst the type
that the industry assumedhe was and needed him to be.
I'm so pleased to meet you.
I'm pleased to meetyou, Mrs. Drayton.
I am artist,
a man,
American.
When he makes'In the Heat of the Night,'
he's playing a cop.
And at some pointhe winds up slapping
And at some pointhe winds up slapping
That was the yearof the smack!
Heard allthrough the neighborhood.
You saw it.
When that mansmacks Sidney...
Oh, I saw it.
And Sidney smacked him back?
Change!
Just the way SidneyPoitier was changing movies
at the time,
another one of Harry'sguests that week, Bill Cosby,
was also changing television.
- He wasn't doing a thing
that you had seenBlack men do before.
He was on 'I Spy'with Robert Culp,
they were both equals.
He was playing anundercover agentalongside this white man.
Hello, sir.
Now!
And he was a veryimportant emblem
of integration in this country.
Yes, sir.
Now, that's what I like!
Let the women work, too.
In the late sixties,television was shifting
in this powerful way.
It was no longerthe terrain ofjust white people.
You can get ridof the uniform.
It makes me feel alittle self conscious.
You should know howit makes me feel.
So now for the first time,
white people who probablynever even came in contact
with Black people werenow in contact with us
in their homes.
Tomorrow night, myguests are Robert Goulet,
George Kirby, ArethaFranklin, Buffy Sainte-Marie.
My job was to bring thebest that Black America
had to offer.
Nipsey?
Yes?
I want to thank Mr. HarrySinger for permitting you
to come up tonight andto be on this show.
Never mind, Harry Singer, thank me.
And to put us outin one concentrated period,
which all of thismagnificence burst out.
The shocking thing is that through 1971,
NBC simply recorded overand over, reused its tape.
Night after night.
Oh, this show's over, let'sjust record on this same tape
the next night.
That's one thing Icould not believe.
You know, whether it'sto save money or space.
I mean, they were bigtwo inch tapes back then.
It shocked Johnny Carsonwhen he found out about it
and it shocked the staffof the entire show.
- My first month at'The Tonight Show,'
I kind of came in withhopeful expectations
of watching all theold footage of anything
that's ever been shotin the 30 Rock building.
However, when I lookedon the video database,
there were only two episodeshosted by Harry Belafonte.
So I guess no one everthought of reruns.
So all of thisis lost to history
except these two half hours,
one with Dr. King,one with Bobby Kennedy.
And five minutes withfolksinger Leon Bibb.
There's a handful of showsthat I, as a curator,
would love to find.
The week that Harry Belafontehosted 'Tonight Show'
is one of the gemsthat we're missing.
- When I discovered this week,I wrote an article about it
and I became borderlineobsessed with it.
I started searchingfor what might exist.
I started interviewing people
and I got introduced tothis man named Phil Gries.
This isNews 12 Long Island.
Now, the morning edition.
18 and
we're rewinding sometelevision history.
There is a collection ofearly TV audio in Old Westbury
and Christina's there now.
Christina.
- Phil Gries has collectedthousands of audio tapes
of old TV shows from the '60s.
Phil, tell us, howdid you get started?
How many tapes do you have?
- Well, there areabout 2,000 programs
that I collectedover the years.
This is the Harry Belafontetape from February 5th and 6th
at 25 minutes.
This would be thequarter inch tape.
This was only audio.
The first experience withaudio recording television
was when I was 14 years old
and I recorded thingsthat nobody else has.
I taped a lot of'Tonight Shows.'
I recorded the first twonights with Harry Belafonte.
Ladies andgentlemen, Harry Belafonte.
So thanks tothese audio tapes,
we have a real sense ofwhat the show was like.
You get to hearHarry sing a song.
He apparently openedevery episode with a song
and we hear him sing thefolk song 'Rock Island Line.'
The Rock Island lineis a mighty good road
Oh, the Rock Islandline is the road to ride
I'm regretful that I didn'trecord that whole week,
because it wasthe first time
that an Afro Americanwas asked to host
five consecutive daysof 'The Tonight Show.'
I am very, veryself conscious about the fact
that I am in thisseat of power.
It does give you afeeling of power.
But I tell you, mygreatest comfort
is to get up and do thething that I love most.
We have a film that Iwould like to show you.
One of the thingsthat stands out to me
was that he showed home movies
of him and hisfamily on vacation.
People haveasked me all the time,
what do I do withmy spare time?
This is what I do.
Watch the monitorsin the studio.
That's my wife andthat's my 10 year old son.
And that's my daughter.
This is a young man bythe name of Ken White,
who was the United Stateswater ski trickskiing champion.
Look at those muscles!
He would perform forabout a month at a time
in those days at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas.
One of the perks of hisservice to the hotel
was that they gave us ayacht every other day.
And we would go out onLake Mead and water ski
and he would also bringa lot of folks.
Celebrities, activistson the boat.
It wasn't justseeing us as Black people
who were in show business,
but seeing Black peopleliving their lives
in ways that were more thanjust being a performer.
Ladies and gentlemen,Miss Lena Horne.
Lena, I never ceased tobe amazed at the fact
that you are a grandmother.
The thing that kept me
from coming apart at the seams
was the fact that Iwanted to stay married
and I wanted toraise my children.
And in a very tough,competitive business.
Ever since that day
When the world
Well, I guess you'vegotten right to the top
in every single phase ofshow business there is,
Movies and records, radio,television, now the stage.
Well, yes, and I'm veryhappy now on the stage.
That I'm beholding
A vision
Lena Horne was a pioneeringAfrican American superstar
who had been very, veryoutspoken politically.
I don't feel like amovie star particularly,
but I'm a New Yorker andwhat happens in the South
happens to my stateand for my state, too.
It's a communaleffort, I'm sure.
Lena Horne becamevery active in politics
in the early civilrights movement
and she even foundherself blacklisted.
In 1963, Lena was invited toa secret civil rights meeting
with then AttorneyGeneral Bobby Kennedy.
She was with Harry, theauthor James Baldwin,
playwright Lorraine Hansberry,
and some younger Blackcivil rights workers.
It did not go well.
Bobby Kennedy was appalledby some of their suggestions
about the measures thatthe US should take
around race, especiallyin the South
and the activists andthe artists were appalled
at his lack of deepunderstanding
of the extent of the problemof racism in the country
where he was the chieflaw enforcement officer.
Will you please welcomeSenator Robert Kennedy?
I ride up and downin my building
every day in the elevatorand I see a man
that says he's Johnny Carson.
So it's greatto see you finally.
It's not, really?
For the most part, myfather's relationship
to Robert Kennedyhad been adversarial,
given who RobertKennedy really was
before he made the choice to learn more
about the plightof poor people.
Well, when we firstgot word that Bobby Kennedy
had been appointed as Attorney General
for the UnitedStates of America,
many of us saw that as anunfortunately dark choice.
With his record ofanti-liberalism,
with his class interestsand having had
no real history or backgroundwith peoples of color.
Dr. King, upon listeningto all of us
and how we criticizedBobby said
go out and findhis moral center.
And we reached out to to him,
gave him opportunityto look at
what was happening tothe poor white children
and in the Black community.
And wed him to our cause.
My father's advice was toactually go to the South.
You see him comingupon a young boy
leaning against a buildingand asks had he had breakfast.
The boy very warmlytold him he didn't.
And I remember BobbyKennedy going to him
and putting his handagainst the boy's cheek.
I saw in that momentthat Bobby Kennedy
was now deeplytouched and moved.
He showed a deeper senseof his own humanity.
He came back with neweyes and a new perspective.
I think my fatherfelt an opportunity
to create intimacy there,in conversation
and to get his feedback.
I think that thereare many areas
in which we have problemsin the United States.
There is this greatwealth that I talked about
and yet there's great poverty.
There are speechesmade about the fact
that we're going totreat everybody equally,
and yet we don't treateverybody equally.
He came on and spoketo issues of race
through the eyesof Black children.
Well, then I was out in Watts
and I went by tosee some young men
and one of them wastalking about the fact
that he lived athome with his mother
and nobody evercleaned the garbage out.
He said, 'They candraft me and send me off
'to fight for thiscountry at the age of 18,
'but they won'tlet me complain about
'the garbage out front besidemy mother's house at 19.'
He spent a good numberof minutes talking about
what he saw America'sfuture to be.
If we didn't, perhaps, telluntruths about ourselves,
then I think that er,
and faced up to reality,
then I think our countrywould be much better off
and our people wouldhave much more confidence
in those of us whoare public officials
and in our governmentas a whole.
Bobby Kennedy becamesort of this spokesman
for civil rights and thewhole progressive movement
and the antiwar movement.
This war has been handeddown and has been
the delinquent child of anumber of presidents.
Absolutely, includingthe administration in which
I was a member and served.
You had the Tet Offensivein January of 1968,
where people finally seethis is going terribly
for Americans.
It's war is a disaster.
The fact that there arethose who've been killed
who are innocently involvedin this great struggle.
Senator, there are increasingreports out of Washington
that your advisorsare now telling you
that you should run againstPresident Johnson this year.
Johnson had become extremelyunpopular with young people.
The war is going so badlythat he's vulnerable.
I have no plans.
I have no plans tochange the statement
that I've already made.
Will you endorse--
There was allkinds of speculation about
would he move on tochallenge Lyndon Johnson
for the presidency?
It was a massive story.
I had tried to get Bobbyto use 'The Tonight Show'
to say that he wasrunning for the presidency
and that I would have had,like you journalists say,
I'd had a scoop!
You said only those whodare to fail greatly
can ever achieve greatly.
Do you believe that in 1968,in the coming elections,
that we will have achoice to back a candidate
who will dare greatly?
I think you were niceto do that, weren't you?
In this campaignyear, political figures are
throwing their hatsinto the ring.
Bobby Kennedydefinitely will...
Come on, Bobby,make up your mind.
It's'The Smothers BrothersComedy Hour.'
Our government isasking us as citizens
to refrain from travelingto foreign lands.
- Okay, all you guys inVietnam, come on home.
Over the last coupleof years I've come to know
and come to respecttwo young men
who have honored me by beingmy guests this evening.
They're quite popularand quite controversial.
Ladies and gentlemen,the Smothers Brothers.
Now Ho Chi Minhsure aint no friend
That's plainfor all to see
And I know someone'sgotta fight over there
But why does it have to be me
The Smothers Brothersbecame very political
and they wantedto deal with issues
that were happeningin society.
Look, what canthe president do
to make people want tostay in this country?
Well, he could quit.
The SmothersBrothers were in the middle
of this massivecontroversy with CBS
because of theiropposition to the war.
They would be doing jokesand mocking the president
that you didn'tsee anywhere else.
My fellow citizens.
Because they were directlycriticizing Lyndon Johnson,
he wound up calling thehead of CBS, William Paley,
at three o'clock inthe morning and saying,
'You gotta stop this.'
Paley did tell thoseguys to knock it off.
The Smothers Brothers said,
'This is the showwe're going to do.
'We're not gonna back off.'
Harry Belafonte had them on.
What aresome of the jokes
that CBS will not permityou to tell on the air?
They'vebeen kind enough
to let us come on this show
and do some of ourdistasteful material.
Make love not war
I think what wasinteresting about the week
and something thatappealed to me personally,
even at that age, was thismix of art and politics.
Chain chain chain
Throughout her careerin the 1960s,
Aretha Franklin was not afraidto make both entertainment
and political music and totie those things together
in a way that would beforever transformative
to popular music.
Oh you're treatingme cruel
Chain chain chain
Just one month before'The Tonight Show'
with Harry Belafonte, ArethaFranklin released her album,
'Lady Soul.'
"Chain of Fools," "You MakeMe Feel Like a Natural Woman,"
"Since You've Been Gone,""Ain't No Way."
This is just one monthbefore 'The Tonight Show,'
so Aretha Franklin wasat the height of her
creative and commercialsuccess.
She is selling morerecords than any woman
in music at thattime and still,
and she's using that moneyto fund the movement,
to fund the activism.
I believe
I do believe
People get readyThere's a train coming
You're so seduced by her voice
that sometimes her activismis seen as a second tier.
('Respect' by Aretha Franklin)
What you want
A song like 'Respect,'which we all know
and associate withAretha Franklin,
that became a huge politicalanthem for so many things,
including thefeminist movement,
but also civilrights movement.
Tonight we aregonna have a great night
in the city of Philadelphia
and I know you've heardof Harry Belafonte
and Aretha Franklin andall of these other
great and outstanding artists.
She was very close toDr. Martin Luther King.
Detroit is proud ofits native daughter.
He was willingto work with her a lot
to try to get his messageto a wider group of people.
Do hereby proclaimFriday, February the 16th
as Aretha Franklin Day.
Martin Luther King understood,
coming from the Black church,
how important music wasto conveying messages.
And so MartinLuther King cultivated
these deep relationshipswith artists
who he saw as beingkey and vital
to the spreadingof his message.
So many artists arewilling to stand up
on these particular issues
and it represents a realand genuine courage.
And not only does he havethe right to take a stand,
but a moral responsibilityto do it.
I was a collegegirl writing songs
that I thought audiencesreally deserved to hear
because who, how arethey going to find out
about the things thatpoliticians and businessmen
are trying to cover up?
This is called'Welcome Emigrante,'
which meanswelcome immigrants.
And it's pretty silly for...
maybe a first or second orthird generation American
to be making fun of andrefusing help to
newly arrived immigrantswhen the fact is
they haven't been herethat long themselves.
And they camefrom far away
To a land they didn't know
The same way youdo my friends
When Harry invited me tocome on 'The Tonight Show,'
of course I was thrilled.
Harry was like the heart andbrains of a lot of things.
He always brought peoplefrom indigenous communities
all over the world onto stage.
And he brought those culturesto audiences in cities,
in big fancy halls, whootherwise would never have
been able tohear those groups.
Now the girls up at CrippleCreek about half-grown
Jump on a boy
Harry gave me the ideathat you could be
an entertaining entertainer,
even if I'm doinghard-hitting material.
You're not trying toscold or hurt people,
you're trying togive them something
that otherwise theywouldn't have known.
When it came to discuss whatI was going to play and sing,
I suggested 'Now Thatthe Buffalo's Gone'
Remember the times
That you have heldyour head high
'Now That the Buffalo'sGone,' which is a song about
the building ofthe Kinzua Dam,
which is a governmentproject that's taken the land
away from the Seneca Indians.
America needed to see
what we were strugglingabout as people of color.
It's here and it's nowyou must help us dear man
Now that thebuffalo's gone
Art without contentis not art.
The truth of the matter isthat I quit being a pop star.
You can't go there andsing protest songs
and sell a million, itain't going to happen.
I knew that I hadto go find an art
that would tell whatlife should be.
And nothing did that betterthan to be in the folk world.
Gotta pull this timberbefore the sun go down
Get it cross the riverbefore the boss come round
Drag it on downthat dusty road
Come on Jerry let'stote that load
In the history of folk music,it's often seen as a kind of
white music, but that'snot actually true at all.
You have to remember,
folk music represented akind of political engagement,
especially forAfrican Americans,
that a lot of R
R
and it's fun and excitingand danceable,
was not necessarilyexplicitly political.
The folk singers hadmuch more latitude.
When we got there thehills were steep
It would make atender person weep
Leon Bibb was asouthern folksinger.
He was not a household name,
but he was somebody thatHarry Belafonte felt
could make an impact if he wasin front of a wide audience.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
America was awakenedto a whole new group
of Black artists theynever heard before.
And Leon was one of them.
Ladies and gentlemen, mydear friend, Mr. Leon Bibb.
There was a songcalled 'Suzanne.'
And I just adored that song.
Suzanne takes you down
To a place by the river
You could hearthe boats go by
You can spend thenight forever
When Leon Bibb came on,I suggested to him
that he sing that song
and it blew everybody away.
Suzanne takes you down
To a place by the river
You can hearthe boats go by
You can spendthe night forever
I remember getting that call.
God, it was a thrill.
And night grows sweeter
The guests that nightwere Leon Bibb,
me, Freda Payne,
Paul Newman, NipseyRussell, Aaron and Freddie
and Reverend Dr. MartinLuther King.
Dr. King, how old are you?
- I'm 39 years old.
In fact, I was 39 justthree weeks ago.
What's the date?
Do you know that everybodysitting on this panel--
The 15th of January.
Do you believe--
You're a young fellow,what are you talking about?
Everybody on thispanel is older than you are.
Wait a minute!
There's no room herefor black protest.
The idea that you'dhave Harry Belafonte...
talking to Nipsey Russell.
Here's a little news.
If you think thatmedicine has to taste bad
in order to be good,just watch.
To have Martin LutherKing talking to Paul Newman
where a white person isa minority on the stage.
Come on, that's crazy!
Paul Newman, one of thegreat actors of the time,
very celebratedinternationally,
had never done atalk show before.
I know that all of the artists
who sit on this paneltonight feel very strongly
about the war in Vietnamand we oppose it.
We also have beenthrough the years
as committed to civil rights as you could possibly be.
I know I've put thisquestion to Paul before,
but Paul, how do you handlesome people who say to you
that as a top star, livingthe luxury of American life,
that you could turn yourback against the nation?
What do you do?
You give up yourcitizenship becauseyou've become an actor?
I remember the nightwith Dr. King.
Unlike the coveragethat was in the papers
and on TV, too,
this was a differentside of Dr. King.
He was relaxed,he was smiling.
Well, I'm delightedto be here, Harry
and I'll tell you,
one of the reasons I'mso happy to be here.
I flew out of Washington this afternoon
and as soon as we startedout, they notified us
that the plane hadmechanical difficulties
and I don't want togive you an impression
that as a Baptist preacher
I don't have faithin God in the air,
it's simply thatI've had more experience
with Him on the ground.
I was kind of amused thathe knew how to get laughter.
Which is something that youdon't see in his speeches
because he's so serious.
My thing was like, 'Oh,he can tell a good joke.'
What do you have instore for us this summer?
I feel that weare in the midst
of the most criticalperiod in our nation
and the economic problem
is probably the mostserious problem confronting
the Negro community andpoor people, generally.
His new project that very week
was the Poor People'sCampaign.
He knew that the civilrights movement itself
would have to give way tosomething much more profound,
economic rights.
But bringing thepeople together
in a much more fundamental way
around issues thataffected everybody,
regardless of race,class, or color.
The week that Dr. Kingwas on 'The Tonight Show,'
he was traveling allover the country
to support thePoor People's Campaign.
It is my hope thatwe will really stand up
to gain power for poor people.
Black people, MexicanAmericans, American Indians,
Puerto Ricans, Appalachianwhites, all working together
to solve theproblem of poverty.
He got it from all sides.
His own staff saidwe haven't finished
a Black lib movementin the South.
Now you're saying thiscampaign is going to have
white coal minersand Mexicans?
You're taking my budget andgiving it to white folks?
I think the time hascome to bring to bear
the nonviolent directaction movement
on the economic conditionsthat we face
all over the country.
He finally got his staff preparing
to go up to Washingtonto start the campaign.
And then the garbagestrike in Memphis happened.
A public official ordersmen to get back to work
and treats them asthough they are not men.
That's a racist point of view.
They said we aretreated like garbage.
That's where the slogan'I am a man' comes from.
I'm a man, not garbage.
And Dr. King said ifthis is not what the
Poor People's Campaignis about, nothing is.
We have to go to Memphis.
You are demanding thatthis city will respect
the dignity of labor.
There was a risingBlack Power movement.
There was a perceptionthat Dr. King
was not moving fast enoughfor the younger Black folks
and the Black nationalists.
Certainly Black peoplein this country
were deeply frustrated byexisting Black leadership.
There was really no aggressivevoice doing for us
what youth feltshould be done.
They were going tobecome the provocateurs,
they were going tobecome the radical voice.
Do you think you'llbe able to keep it
nonviolent, Dr. King?
Yes, I think so.
I don't have any doubtin my mind about that.
Mr. Carmichael,are you as committed
to the nonviolentapproach as Dr. King is?
No, I'm not.
No one in thiscountry is asking
the white community in theSouth to be nonviolent.
And that, in a sense, isgiving them a free license
to go ahead andshoot us at will.
Harry would hostmeetings in his apartment
in which Dr. King wouldhave truce talks.
Harry was somebodywho was trusted
by the radical youngkids and by Dr. King.
He had this ambassador role.
The week that Dr. Kingwas on 'The Tonight Show,'
I don't think anybody inAmerica knew all the strains
that were colliding.
He extended all ofthe movements thathe was involved with
beyond the capacityof any man.
He had denouncedthe Vietnam War.
The fact is we spendapproximately $500,000
to kill eachViet Cong soldier.
While we spend onlyabout $53 a year
for every person categorizedas poverty stricken.
The cruel truth isthat Dr. King had been
denounced in the media.
New York Times and theWashington Post said
he's trying to bea peace leader,
he should stickto civil rights.
We'll never respect him again.
He was a verybeleaguered person
when he came on'The Tonight Show'
because he was having troublegetting people to understand
how all of his messagesfit together.
And there was a sense that thezeitgeist had moved past him.
Do you fear for your life?
It was well known that Dr.King was getting death threats
and Dr. King went through aperiod of being very fearful,
actually, he was only human.
We have lived with this a number of years now,
since we started out inMontgomery, Alabama in 1956.
I had to dealwith this problem
because if I movedaround, worrying about it,
it would completelyimmobilize me.
And so I've come to the pointthat I take this whole matter
very philosophically.
I'm more concerned aboutdoing something for humanity
and what I consider the willof God than about longevity.
Ultimately, it isn't soimportant how long you live,
the important thingis how well you live.
'The Tonight Show'was definitely his last
major nationaltelevision appearance.
He didn't have that manynational televisionappearances.
I mean, it's easy to forget
how segregated Americanmedia still was in that era.
Dr. King, thank you somuch for being here tonight.
Goodnight.
Thank you for being here.
What can I say aboutHarry Belafonte?
He's one of a kind.
Would you welcomeHarry Belafonte?
Just about a monthafter Harry's hosting gig,
Johnny Carson had himback on 'The Tonight Show'
to talk about it.
Did you have a ball with it?
I caught you acouple of nights,
looked like you werehaving a great time.
I had a marvelous time.
The grooviest timein the world here
the week that I spent here.
We ended with ratingsthat were larger than
the ones we opened with
and we opened withthe largest numbers
in the history of the show.
I must honestly say that
each and every memberof your staff
did everything in the worldto make me comfortable.
He took out a fullpage in Variety,
thanking the entire staff
and all the gueststhat were on the show
and it did say I enjoyedmy 'sit-in' on'The Tonight Show.'
You had a great week.
Once you lay backand have fun with it,
you can't go too far wrong.
But you never knowthat in the beginning.
No.
I also got a numberof letters protesting
they didn't wantto be preached to.
People came thereto be entertained.
We consciously putbefore the public
all of the issues that theysaw during the past week...
with the knowledge thatthey were hearing
things that they wouldnever have heard before.
There were mixed reactions.
There were those peoplethat they've watchedthe Vietnam War
during dinnertime and youknow, by the time it came to
30 at night theyjust wanted to relax.
He willed a worldinto being for one week.
He really wanted to createthis integrated world
and show us how goodit could be.
Some people walkedin and loved it
and some peopleslammed the door shut.
For those of you whomight not be aware,
there was a, I guess wecan term it an incident
that happened duringthe taping with
Harry and Petula Clark on it.
That was in California,wasn't it?
Yes, out of the NBC studios.
Blessed are themeek they say
They shall win where others lose
Just about a month afterPetula Clark appeared
with Harry on'The Tonight Show,'
she invited Harryonto her own special.
Evil will bebrought to justice
On the path of glory
'Path of Glory'is a protest song.
It's about these youngmen going off to war
and in rehearsal,we were bothvery moved by it.
So when we came to tapeit, that emotion showed
and I put my handon Harry's arm.
Why should manbe forced to kill
Why should theybe made to die
And that's when allthe problems started
with with the sponsor.
Miss Clark reached up andput her right hand on my arm
like this and it...
I like that.
Not half bad at all, really.
Anyway, uh...
Now wait till you see whatwe're accused of tomorrow.
He's touchingthe white lady.
He's touching, oh,did he just kiss, oh!
You know, it's Petula Clark.
He touched a white lady.
Not supposed to do that.
The car called Plymouth's really made it clear
She was calledthe Plymouth girl.
The Plymouth representativeon the set,
he said 'No, no, no,you're not through.
'We have to takethe touch out.'
They wanted to sellcars in the South, so.
That was a no-no.
My star, that is to say, me,
can't be touching aBlack man's arm.
At that point, I turnedto Pet Clark and said,
'Look, this is your show,what do you want to do?'
She said, 'The touch stays.'
I said, 'Well, that's it.'
In a time when a nationis really strugglingfor its soul,
you know, on the heelsof the president's report
on the riots that tookplace in the summer,
I believe that all ofus have a responsibility
to do everythingwe can to salvage
the best that's in America,
because there's a greatdeal that's good about it.
Like anybody, I wouldlike to live a long life.
Longevity has its place.
But I'm not concernedabout that now.
Dr. King had developedsevere hiccups
and he would kindof sort of...
In the middle of a momenthave a hiccuping fit.
And then somewheredown the line,
I discovered that that tickwas no longer as evident.
And I asked him, 'You seem tohave gotten over the hiccup.
'What happened?'
And he looked and said,"It's very simple, Harry."
He said, 'I made mypeace with death.'
Yeah.
Huh.
Martin had been in my home
a few days beforehe was murdered.
10this evening,
Martin Luther Kingwas shot in Tennessee.
Martin Luther King,20 minutes ago died.
I heard that he'd been shot
when a member of my staffcame into the living room
at my home to tell me toturn on the television
and to take a look.
And I could not believe.
I cannot talk a lot aboutthat period, I get upset.
The emotion of the time.
The first time I eversaw my father cry
was at the announcement ofthe assassination of Dr. King.
He sort of, I think he kindof went numb a little bit.
Assassinationsseemed to be a big part
of the American horror story.
What's the worst experience you had
in terms of being on thereceiving end of prejudice?
I think the death of Dr. King.
Very personally, it wasa prejudiced act,
a sick act thatsnuffed out his life
in a time when a nationneeded him desperately.
And I believethere's a prophet
We were very, very close.
In heaven
Yes there is
Whatever's been done toyou God is gonna...
Oh yes He will
He dove into the work todefend against, I think,
feeling that deeperpain and shock
because how does onereally recover from that?
That's something thatyou carry forever.
In the work that we were doing
in the civil rights movement,with not only Dr. King,
but all of the otherleaders of that period,
we were aware that we werestirring up a hornet's nest
and that there was goingto be a price to be paid.
Martin Luther Kingdedicated his life
to love and to justicebetween fellow human beings.
He died in the causeof that effort.
About a month after hewas on 'The Tonight Show'
with Harry, BobbyKennedy actually declared
that he was indeed goingto run for president.
For a lot of us young Blackand Mexican American men,
Bobby Kennedy gaveus hope again.
He spoke about anAmerica that was really
the dream and the wishthat everybody possessed.
Every American, no matterwhat his background,
what his creed, whatcolor of his skin
or where he lives shallwalk with dignity and honor
in the United States.
I had been campaigningwith him quite intensely.
So I had been very muchinvolved with Bobby,
talking about all of theissues of a campaign.
And going to California,none of us were concerned
about his welfarein that community.
Because of all the places,California was certainly
one of the mostliberal environments.
Robert Kennedyis dead.
He's gone the same wayhis brother did.
When he was taken awayfrom us, there was a void
that he just left thathas yet to be filled.
The loss of Dr. Kingcoupled with what happened
with Bobby Kennedy,set us up as a nation
to become as mismanaged aswe are presenting ourselves
to be at this moment.
The death of thosetwo men changed
the American climate severely.
Good evening and thankyou for joining us tonight
as we don't plan to do theusual 'Tonight Show' format
this evening.
Within a few monthsof their appearance
on 'The Tonight Show,' bothDr. King and Bobby Kennedy
had been assassinated.
Johnny Carson helda round table.
He knew Bobby Kennedy,but it wasn't just that.
He knew what was happeningto the country.
And he thought it wasimportant enough
to turn his whole showover to that topic.
All of the words andphrases you've heard
the past four days, I thinkthe immediate thing was
we're a violent nation,we're a sick society.
What's wrong with us?
We're living like animals.
What is wrongwith this country?
What the Harry Belafonteweek did
was open the doorto serious conversation
on these late night shows
about serious things.
But I say that this countryhas been going through
a revolution inthe last few years,
just this country'sin turmoil.
And I know that thereis a seed of revolution
that's going through, the seedof change is going through.
The idea that people, justbefore they would go to bed,
would be interested, notonly in entertainment,
but politics.
This is something thatHarry Belafonte proved
in February of 1968.
And I, for one,welcome the fact
that artists have taken a stand for peace
and have taken astand for justice.
I think since 1968 it'sbeen very hard for folks.
And the country'snever been the same.
And it's been terrific,
but I think it mayhave angered folks,
which led us towhere we are today.
The violence and hostilityis still in America.
What have we missed intrying to reach those people
with our message?
I'm now 90 years old
and I've been at this gamesince I was a teenager.
The backlash has continuedever since the 1960s.
Dr. King said there's goingto be a tremendous resentment
against the government forsponsoring civil rights.
You've had a cynicism andan antigovernment movement
as a way of dealing with race
without actuallymentioning race.
Television and politics,late night,
would come to fruitionin the '90s
with Jon Stewart and othersmaking us more uncomfortable
as we approach sleep,
worrying about the countryand all the issues facing us.
Nine people were shotin a Black church
by a white guy who hatedthem, who wanted to start
some kind of civil war.
If you're with agroup of people that are
chanting things like'Jews will not replace us'
and you don't immediatelyleave that group,
you are not avery fine person.
Isn't it interestinghow every time
Republicans create avoting restriction,
it just so happens todisproportionately affect
people of the brown-brown?
Hmm?
Trump isn't the onlyone John Bolton implicates
in his book.
He also names angry babybird, Mike Pompeo.
Pompeo
Pompeo
Pompeo
Pompeo
Pompeo.
Even if Trump is re-elected,this Ukraine story
will haunt him untilthe blessed day
when he's forcibly plungedout of the White House
like a toilet clog.
Late night has becomeincreasingly political
in the Trump years,which is good.
But remains very, very white.
Stephen's the firstlate night hostfrom South Carolina.
Right.
And the bajillionth white guy.
Exactly.
This chewing gum tastes funny.
It's a thousand dollars forthe 10th anniversary iPhone.
I didn't spend athousand dollars
on my 10th weddinganniversary, okay?
I think it's been toughfor Black people
to have long runningshows in late night
because of the lackof investment.
Kamala Harris isbeing criticized
for not being Black enough.
Yes.
Which frankly isthe same criticism
I've had to enduremy entire career.
White male late nighthosts are given
a lot more room to grow.
Believe me, howevershocked you are
that I am doing this job,
you will never beas shocked as I am.
We've had some late nighthosts, as Arsenio Hall.
I feel great.
There are probably peoplein Utah saying, 'Who is he?'
From 1968 until Arsenio Hall.
To have that longwithout another Blackface in late night
is wild to me.
It took a longtime in between.
'Cause I think he did toogood a job, scared everybody.
They said, oh no, we're notgonna do this for a while.
We're not giving youthe late night
and you know, to this day,
not much dark meatin late night.
Now, this week marks oneyear since Trump's election.
Now, the traditional firstanniversary gift is paper,
so we got him this.
There's been a rotatingdoor of women in late night.
Most never wentbeyond one season.
It's 'The LateShow' starring Joan Rivers.
Whoopi!
Welcome back.
I need to hear Black womenand I need to hear Black men
and I need to hear Latinas andI need to hear Asian people.
Like, I need to heareveryone's opinions.
Otherwise you'rejust getting one.
And that is never the truth.
That's what was soimportant about
what Harry Belafontedid back then in 1968.
And it's why it's so importantthat Black representation
in late night isimportant now.
Black people inAmerica are like,
oh, we've been sayingthis justice systemis crazy as shit.
And now Trump is like,'So crazy!
'So wild, whowould have thought?'
See, if he had Black friendsthey would have told him.
I think we've justgot to keep working
to make that week reality
and to create a spacein entertainment
where Black people willalways have a stake
and will always have a say,
and will always beable to talk about
the issues that matter.
Whoa, Black identity...
To us and matter tothe world at large.
I think the legacyof that week
was speaking to issues thathad serious content and intent
and how easily wedid it as a people.
I thought that we weretalking about was
engrossing, entertaining.
I thought thatall the subtext,
the social issues of the day,
to hear people talkabout the craft
that brought themto public limelight.
The American public wasnot only entertained,
but were glued to whatthis was all about.
He pursued justiceand marched with kings
And hosted shows andbroke boundaries and
He believed inhumanity and
Shined the light onadversity and
Like the soulsof the rivers
Like the faithwouldn't quiver

Are you alert?
Okay, well tell them...
No.
I'll be there in about 15 minutes, so stop arguing.
Okay, thanks. Bye.
Morning, Freddy. Morning, Abby.
You look awfully pretty today. Oh, is it that bad in there?
Good morning. We got problems. Morning.
There are no problems, Joy, only solutions.
The traffic camera is down and we have no B roll for our traffic segment.
That is a problem. Yeah.
Call Matt at Media Lab. He's got some Skycams.
Where are all my weathermen? Right here.
Hey. Hello.
Thank you all for coming. You guys look great.
Thanks for being here. Good.
Is there a reason they're all overweight?
If they get the forecast wrong...
...research shows people are more willing to forgive a fat guy.
I hate to do this. I don't think I can work with her.
It's bad enough I have to take her criticism at home.
A man can only endure so much. Larry, you are not a man...
...you are a newsman.
Newsmen are not defined by the easy times...
...they're defined by the hard times.
Can you imagine Ted Koppel or Tom Brokaw...
...working with their wives as co anchors? No.
Because they couldn't handle it.
But you. You, my friend, have balls the size of Volkswagens.
Don't think I haven't noticed. I only thought of them as blue of late.
But you're right. They're quite sizeable.
But not disproportionately so. I think of them as aesthetically pleasing.
Yeah, I think I made my point.
Are you kidding me right now? Nobody in Sacramento...
...gives a crap about the extinction rate of the Brazilian slug worm.
Knowing which celebutante is in rehab is of vital importance?
Your voice makes my hair... Okay. He is trying to kill me.
He knows I can't eat crab. It's Crab Rangoon.
Who doesn't eat Crab Rangoon? Oh, my God. Does anybody see this?
Is that a hive? No, looks like syphilis to me.
You wouldn't even know what syphilis looks like if it weren't for my story.
Standby to go to three. Yeah, so some...
Cacciatore gets mushrooms, garlic. Exactly.
Yeah. Put the mushrooms in. All right.
And whatever amount of garlic you want.
Really? You can't have enough garlic.
Oh, you can. I certainly can.
Do it every night. I got a nice, big spoon for you.
Oh, excellent. Thank you. Here you go.
That good? I have to say, Rocco...
...this is the best chicken cacciatore I've ever tasted.
I knew you'd like it. It's duck cacciatore, actually.
Oh, no. Did he just say "duck"?
And it's a great alternative to chicken.
It kind of tastes just like chicken, right?
Duck, like "quack, quack" duck?
Get ready to roll to break. Yeah.
Whoa, duck. Yeah.
Man, we're a chicken household.
We are. Tell Larry to throw it to Javier...
...while she pulls it together. Or is it okay?
It's good. Javier, do you like it?
Can I take home the leftovers?
You sure you don't want any leftovers? When we return...
...our live Skycam traffic update. Okay.
And guess who's in rehab this week?
Standby to roll break. Also, how you can adopt...
... your very own slug worm, when we come back.
Roll your break. How about salt? Salt make it better?
I don't know how you do it.
It's just a matter of looking chaos right in the eye and telling it to eff off.
You guys did great. Thank you.
I think it's time for a new chef on this show. I do.
Now, come on. Rocco's been with us...
Abby? It's this upsetting?
Hey, Stuart wants to see you. He's freaking out.
Oh, he got the ratings.
Want some? Yeah, give me that.
Have you seen the ratings from yesterday?
We got beat by all the network shows, including a rerun of Who's the Boss?
The one where the vacuum breaks.
It's just a temporary setback. Things will be better tomorrow.
You know that guy with the cable access show...
...on Channel 83 does better.
If we programme Jerry Springer reruns...
...we'd do a nine share at a quarter of the price.
Please don't tell me you're thinking of killing the show.
We're not a family run station anymore, Abby.
I mean, I love you. You're great at what you do.
But you gotta get me some numbers.
I got two daughters in college and a son in beauty school.
I don't know how much you know about Vidal Sassoon, but that shit ain't cheap.
I can rally. I will rally.
You do rally. Every day, Abby.
But that's what worries me.
That even you won't be enough.
I should not be letting corporate management...
...dictate the content of this show. It's my show.
I control it. I should skip the date tonight.
Stay home, think up some ideas for sweeps.
Absolutely not, Abby.
You should be out there observing humanity.
Humanity is who watches our show. Yeah. All 2.47 percent of them.
You have rescheduled on this guy three times.
You cancel on him tonight and he's gone.
Look at this bone structure.
This could be the bone structure of your future children.
Don't you want them to be symmetrical? You printed his profile?
What? Yes. These have not been touched in some time.
I have to live vicariously through your life.
I really think that this could be our next boyfriend.
Hi. Hello.
I'm looking for a guy with sandy brown hair, athletic build, blue eyes.
He's 5'9". Which I know you're thinking is short...
...but he's read The Great Gatsby... Well, technically 5'8" and a half...
...but I could read The Great Gatsby again if it makes it any better.
Hi. Can I get some water for the table?
Yeah, a bottle of flat water, please?
Sure. Thank you.
Just one second. I'm sorry. Did you know they've done studies that show...
...tap water and bottled water are the same thing.
They passed a law where restaurants have to filter their tap water...
...so it's filtered water, which is the same as bottled water...
...except you don't have to pay 7 dollars for it.
I like the way it tastes better. Can I get a Scotch on the rocks too?
Thank you. Oh, yeah.
I thought...
I thought in your profile it said you... You like to drink red wine.
You printed out my profile? My associate producer did.
She doesn't like me to not be prepared. Not that I'm ever not prepared.
Kudos, by the way, on your comprehensive car insurance plan.
That wasn't in my profile. No, but it's in your background check.
So tell me about yourself.
Well, what's left to talk about that you don't already know?
Good point.
All right, well, you know...
...I actually took the liberty of printing out some talking points...
...in case this happened.
I take it this has happened before? No. No.
But you have nine out of 10 of the necessary attributes on my checklist.
Oh, dear God. Okay.
Oh, this is a good one. Let's start with three, okay?
Don't ask.
More on this when we come back. We'll hear from a zoo official forced to take...
And we're back with The Ugly Truth, where we're gonna be talking about...
... what it is men and women really want in relationships.
I've been looking through some books. Smart Women, Foolish Choices.
Men Who Love Women Who Hate Them.
And Women Hating Men Who Loved Women Who Hate Loving Men.
Billions and billions wasted on psychobabble bullshit.
Now, listen up, ladies, because I'm only gonna say this once...
...and it is just three little words:
Men are simple.
We cannot be trained.
All this, "men are from Venus" crap is a waste of your time and money.
You wanna be a lonely hag, then that's fine, keep reading these stupid books.
But you want a relationship, then here's how you get one:
It's called a Stairmaster.
Get on it, and get skinny...
... and get some trashy lingerie while you're at it...
...because at the end of the day, all we're interested in is looks.
And no one falls in love with your personality at first sight.
We fall in love with your tits and your ass...
...and we stick around because of what you're willing to do with them.
So you wanna win a man over, you don't need 10 steps...
...you need one, and it's called a blowjob.
And don't forget to...
Okay? Now, let's take the first caller.
How dare you burn those books.
They've helped my personal life more than I can say.
What's your boyfriend's name, princess?
Well, I'm not seeing anyone right now.
My point exactly, Shrek. Next caller.
You're on the air.
So you're saying that men are incapable of love?
Oh, did I burst your little harlequin romance bubble?
What? Come on.
The only thing you burst is your credibility.
Men are completely capable of experiencing love.
Okay, I'll bite. Go on. Who's the guy?
What? The guy. Mr. Wonderful.
The one who's so capable of love. Who is he? What's he like?
He's smart, he's handsome but he doesn't know it.
He's successful, but in a job that means something.
He loves red wine, picnics, classical music.
This is a guy in America, right?
I mean, you're not calling from Europe or something?
He loves dogs, but he's more of a cat person.
He never gets up before you on a Sunday morning.
Wait a second, I get it.
You're a lesbian.
What? Well, you must be.
I mean, you just described the perfect woman.
Why are you so threatened by these qualities?
Is it perhaps because you don't possess a single one of them...
...and that is the real reason why women aren't interested in you?
Okay. Okay, I'll give you 100 bucks of my own money...
... to go get this guy and bring him down here and let me meet him.
Well, he's out there, somewhere.
Wait a second.
You're not even dating this guy?
No, I'm describing a type.
I thought that's what we were doing.
What? You don't even know him?
Whoa, okay, now I get the picture.
Hold on. Oh, you're a dog.
What? Well, you must be.
Come on, you heard me. I mean, if you were...
If you were hot, you would be out breaking some poor schmuck's heart...
... instead of spending all your time fantasizing about Mr. Wonderful.
Face it...
... you're ugly.
I am not ugly.
Well, okay, let me help you out here.
You might as well face the fact that you're gonna be alone...
... and stop pining away for some fantasy guy you're never gonna get.
How can you possibly...? Hey, Lassie.
The show's called The Ugly Truth. If you can't face it, don't call.
That wraps it up for this evening.
I'm Mike Chadway reminding you that the truth is never pretty.
How'd the date go?
Well, I was very pleased with the choice of restaurant.
That is so awesome. Why?
Good morning, everyone.
Morning. Morning.
Now, before I play you this, I should warn you...
...this guy's a little rough around the edges.
Face it, you're ugly. I am not ugly.
Well... Why are we watching this?
Say hello to our new guest commentator.
I'm starting him at two segments a week, three minutes a pop.
Are you kidding me? Who the hell is this guy?
Name's Mike Chadway. And he's an uber moron misogynist...
...who represents everything wrong with television and society.
I get crap every time I suggest we do something remotely fluffy.
Oh, come on. He's got a point of view.
We don't have to like it. I mean, we're news people.
We're objective. Stone Phillips interviews terrorists.
Doesn't mean he likes them, he does it for ratings.
I have a list of ideas to improve ratings.
You're gonna like it. We don't need him. Not at all.
"An intimate profile of the mayor." I like that.
I like the mayor. Fantastic.
The mayor? Yes. It can be edgy and yet intriguing.
Unless you can get him to bang three crack whores...
...and a German shepherd on live TV, no one's gonna give a shit.
Oh, I'm sorry. I was eavesdropping out in the hall.
What did I tell you? Isn't this guy great?
Oh, thanks, boss.
You already hired him?
Who's this delightful creature?
I'm your producer.
Hey.
I like a woman on top.
God.
Nice office. He's just kidding.
Oh, yeah.
Excuse me. Mike, you see your office?
No, I didn't. Let me show you.
Beautiful. Everybody take five. I'll be right back.
Were you all not there last year for our sexual harassment meeting?
Were you not there, Larry? He needs to go.
He wasn't sexually harassing me.
I am an award winning news producer. Award winning producer.
I am an award winning news producer. I am an award winning news producer.
You're an award winning news producer.
You don't knock? Well, I did knock. You didn't answer.
So essentially, your knock was negated by your complete lack of adherence...
...to the social etiquette that follows a knock.
You're wound like a fucking top.
Woof, woof. Remember the bark?
Last night, a little phone conversation we had.
Yeah. Hey, what do you know?
You're not ugly at all.
Oh, well, imagine my relief.
I want to thank you for getting me this gig.
I would never have gotten it without you.
You and I, we make good TV.
You make imbecilic trash watched by housebound inbreds who are so busy...
...with their hands down their pants, they can't change the remote.
I hadn't been picturing you that way, but it's a nice image.
I do not watch your programme.
My cat stepped on the remote.
Oh, you want to thank your pussy for me, then?
Larry, Georgia, listen to me. I want you to skewer him.
I want Mike Chadway to go down in flames.
I want Mike Chadway to be nothing but a pile of ash next to you.
I want the janitor to come vacuum up the ashes of Mike with his Dustbuster...
...and when he dumps it outside, I want the rats to vomit and defecate...
...on the ashes of Mike Chadway.
And I thought you were angry and bitter.
No, Larry, that would be my untouched vagina.
Chadway? What?
Twenty seconds to air.
There's a bird in my dressing room. I'll take care of it.
A real bird? It's flying around.
A sparrow? Why?
I don't know what type of bird it is. Security here is awful.
You guys have really got to keep the doors closed.
Four, three...
Morning, everyone, I'm Larry Freeman. Another beautiful day in Sacramento.
And I'm here with a beautiful woman.
Go, 1. All right, here we go.
Thank you, Larry.
I'm Georgia Bordeney. Ready for the single on Georgia.
For years, there have been concerns about lowering television standards.
But many believe that this man and his local public access show...
...have brought things to a new low.
With that, we welcome Mike Chadway.
How you doing, guys?
Mike, how do you respond to people who say your show is offensive?
Well, it is. But then again, so is the truth.
The truth about what, Mr. Chadway?
What relationships are really like.
Take marriage, for instance.
It's about social pressure, status and sex.
If it weren't for these three things, men and women wouldn't even speak.
Oh, dear. Sounds to me like no one's ever loved you...
...and you're taking that out on the female population.
Good one.
It's like Crossfire. That was a good one.
While we're making these observations...
...you two project this image of the perfect couple, when clearly it's a lie.
Excuse me?
Holy shit. Break for commercial.
No. Stuart said keep rolling no matter what.
What? When? This is my show.
Not right now, it isn't. Not right now.
Come on, Larry. I watched your show for years.
You used to be this cool, confident cat.
What the hell happened to you?
And you, Georgia. I mean, this one's no dumb bunny.
The only way she was getting off the weekend shift...
...was by hooking up with you.
Then, lo and behold, she became more popular than you did.
Ended up with twice your salary.
Camera 2, two shot. Come on, Larry, take him down.
Hold on, pal. I am very proud of my wife's success.
Baloney, you are. You hate her success.
You feel emasculated by her.
And that screws with your head.
Which, in turn, screws with your manhood.
What's your point?
Yes, Georgia, take control. My point, Georgia...
My point is that your husband...
...hasn't had sex with you in...
...I'm gonna say, what, three months?
Chadway, that is not my fault. I know.
I mean, come on. I know, I know. It's her fault.
Why is it my fault? What am I supposed to do?
Say no to the money so he can get an erection?
She just said "erection" on television.
Other networks do it. They're talking about erections.
They say "erection" on Sesame Street.
I agree. Thank you.
You've economically emasculated your husband...
...to such a point that he's afraid to want you.
I mean, sure, you could dump his ass...
...but, honey, have you seen the eligible men in Sacramento? Oh, God.
It's slim pickings for a woman in her 40s, I can tell you.
Forties?
Oh, God. Hold that shot with Georgia and Mike.
He just talked about her age.
She's gonna kill me. Well...
Forty? I mean, you ain't gonna do...
...any better than Larry.
You just have to let him be a man.
Let him be a man, Georgia. I let him be a man.
You have to let me be a man. I have tried.
Let him be a man. You have to let me.
Simple as that. Now, you, Frowny McFlaccid, come on.
Oh, God. Camera 1, ready for a three shot.
I'm not frowny. Yes, you are.
Move in here and give this beautiful woman a kiss.
God. This is ridiculous. McFlaccid?
That mean what I think it means? Yes. Kiss her.
No. They're not gonna... Give it to her, right in front of me.
And in front of them. Let me...
Goddamn it, Georgia, let me be a man.
No! Oh. Zoom in on that, 2. Zoom in.
America doesn't want to see this.
And that, my friends, is the ugly truth.
Get ready to roll to break. Ready to roll...
Oh, you are a man. He is a man. Break.
Cut to commercial!
Cut to commercial! That was great! Wasn't that great?
I told you that guy was great.
Good job, everybody.
Abby?
Found her.
One thousand, one hundred and forty three calls...
...over 300 e mails, 53 percent of them were women.
This guy's a lightning rod.
They liked him?
Liked him? They loved him. Ninety three percent positive.
How is that possible? Well, I don't know.
But I am scaling back the news and giving it to The Ugly Truth.
Stuart, I really think this is a mistake. What do we even know about this guy?
Who is he, really? Moved here when he was 10...
...pitched two consecutive Little League Championships. Cute.
"Most Likely to Get Slapped" in his senior yearbook.
Three years San José State, Salesman of the Year at Dobson Medical in '04.
Once arrested for urinating out of a moving vehicle... That is challenging.
Tell me about it. Never married, hates asparagus.
Look, let's just keep a smile on this guy's face...
...and we'll both get our contracts renewed.
Congratulations?
Mike. Hi, it's Lauren. I'm having a party on Saturday...
... and you know what happens when I drink tequila.
It's me, Nikki. Why haven't you called me? I miss you.
I can't stop thinking about your huge... Hey.
Who's that? Rubbing all over my...
Dripping wet... How was...?
How was school?
Well, you totally hosed me. What?
Last week on your show, you said, "Always be mean to hot girls...
...because they'll want you more." Well, I tried it on Shauna.
She cried, and then I got detention.
First of all, don't listen to what I say on my show.
Second of all, you're supposed to do that to 25 year old girls...
...who think they're hot and can get any guy they want...
...not 14 year old girls.
They're going through puberty.
They got enough problems.
Mom said when she was 14, she was the prettiest girl in class.
Well, I was there when she was 14, and let me tell you something. She lied.
Don't listen to your Uncle Mike.
He was blind from touching himself inappropriately.
That's a nice thing to tell your son.
Like he hasn't heard worse on your show.
Let's hope you can clean it up now that you're on a network.
Congrats.
D'Artagnan, no, you didn't.
No, D'Artagnan, you get back here. Get back here.
No, do not... No, no, no.
D'Artagnan.
D'Artagnan.
Shit.
All right.
I'll just come up.
I'm really not that flexible, D'Artagnan. I'm coming.
I got you, hold on.
Hold on. Come here, baby.
No, no. No, no. Come on. Come here, D'Artagnan.
Good boy. Oh, good boy. Okay.
Okay. You're gonna be okay.
I hope we can get down.
Oh, my.
Oh, my.
My, my.
He flosses.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
Somebody help me! Somebody help me!
I'm stuck in a tree!
Help me! Anybody!
I'm stuck in a tree! I'm stuck! Stay, stay, calm.
You're gonna be fine. Get me down! Get me down!
Sorry. Oh, my God.
So you just moved in. That's great.
I'm Abby, by the way.
Your neighbour from across the way.
So you're a doctor? An orthopaedic surgeon.
Yeah, I do a lot of leg and hip stuff, but I do get the occasional foot.
Your ankle seems to be fine. Just a mild sprain, this should help.
Great. Thank you.
I guess I'm pretty lucky my cat chose the tree outside your window to climb.
I'm here whenever you need me.
I'm gonna put my home number on the back of my business card.
If your ankle starts giving you any problems, give me a call.
Great. Thanks.
Oh, wow, that's so weird. He doesn't usually like men.
Well, you know, dogs are great, but I'm a cat person.
Yeah.
Well, I guess I'll get going, then.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thanks again for saving my life. Anytime.
Okay. Okay. Bye.
You forgot your cat. Right.
I had a spider on me.
Yeah. It's gone now, though. Good.
Bye. Okay.
Thanks again. Good night.
You are not gonna believe how perfect he is.
Symmetrical? Oh, you have no idea.
Oh, good Lord. Yeah.
How did you leave it? He ask for your number?
No, but he gave me his. Should I call him?
If I call do call him, what should I say? Okay. Take a breath.
And please, sweetheart, no tap water. No tap water.
Don't bring it up. You've got naughty eyes.
Anyone ever tell you that? I have naughty everything.
Hold that thought. No, hey, you won't get in trouble.
Down a bit. Down a bit.
Okay.
Bye, Karen.
Keep it clean, moving, stick to the script.
You are on a live affiliate news programme.
You do not have the luxury of using "blow" and "job" in the same sentence.
If you say anything scatological, you will be fired.
Oh, really? Yes.
I thought that you were the one that was gonna get fired...
...if you don't keep me happy.
Yes. I've got a list of demands that I would like to make after the show...
...and let me just warn you, they're gonna be scatological.
Just because you look pretty today...
...I won't mention the misguided phallic rage you just displayed.
When you hear my voice, just do what I say.
Promise you'll talk dirty?
Good morning, Sacramento. I'm Larry Freeman.
And I'm Georgia Bordeney.
And I'm Mike Chadway.
And this is The Ugly Truth.
Where we'll be taking a few minutes every day...
...to talk about men, women and relationships.
Let's start with men.
Men are simple.
To illustrate my point, here we have a classic romantic setting.
We have candlelight, champagne, and even...
... your own personal violinist.
Now...
... over here, we have something quite different.
This isn't on my list. Follow me.
Is the segment over?
Where the hell's he going?
Follow him. Follow him. Go with him, Remote 1.
Hey. Babes wrestling in Jell O.
Oh, Jell O. That's great. Hello? Abby?
There's people calling and freaking out. Oh, Jesus.
Sit down! Turn the monitor up.
Let's take a quick survey and see which option the men out there would pick.
We have classical music and candle lit dinner...
...or semi naked chicks wrestling in strawberry flavoured goo.
Oh, shit.
All right. If we're gonna do this, we might as well milk it.
Two, get ready to go wide. One, tight on his hand.
Lick the Jell O off her finger.
Lick the Jell O off her finger.
Just do it.
I was wrong. It's cherry.
Back to you in the studio, Georgia. Bye.
Coming up, we're gonna visit the aquarium...
...and see how Penny the Porpoise is.
Can she clear that 10 foot pole with a ball on her nose? When we come back.
When we come back.
Chemistry. I smell threesome.
Great job, ladies. I can still taste you.
You know what I mean.
Do you realise that I once had the Archbishop Desmond Tutu on this show?
Who's that? Can't demonstrate how far I've fallen...
...you're not smart enough to get the references.
Hey, wait. I thought we were a great team back there.
You told me to lick the Jell O.
Do you understand how much I hate myself for that?
It was cheap titillation. I am now going to broadcasting hell...
...right behind the naked weathergirl from Canada.
Seriously?
There's a naked weathergirl?
Hey, can we get her?
You have to do it for the ratings, Abby.
Think of my son. My son, who had a dream of being a cosmetician.
Think about him. Think about Joy.
Just do it for me.
Today it'll be partly sunny with a cloud cover moving in from my left breast.
Low pressure systems are moving up, so expect a cold front.
Watch Mike Chadway on Sacramento A. M...
... giving us The Ugly Truth each and every day...
... at 9:00, right here on Channel 2. Oh, God.
I used to like caviar, until I found out it was made out of fish eggs.
You know that? Caviar's revolting.
I almost started to gag. Morning, ladies.
John. Yesterday's ratings.
Thanks, John.
Guess I should be happy about this, right?
Yeah. Yeah. You've never gotten a 12 share before.
I feel dirty.
Did you hear about the ratings? Yes, I am the producer.
Then did you hear corporate's coming next week...
...to take me out to dinner?
Well, let's hope you can chew with your mouth closed.
Why do you hate my guts?
Your innards are of no consequence to me. It's what you represent.
Oh, you hate the truth.
Your skewed perception of male female interaction is not the truth.
But your imaginary boyfriend's the truth?
For your information, I happened to meet him.
Well, I hope he's real this time, because otherwise this is just sad.
Oh, he's real. He's very real.
Not to mention stunningly handsome, morally sound. He's a surgeon.
An orthopaedic surgeon.
You know what that means. What?
Had to stick his finger up some guy's butt in medical school.
You disgust me.
So did Butt Boy ask you out? Not yet.
We're taking things slow, getting to know each other first.
Why am I talking to you about this?
In other words, he didn't actually ask you out.
What are you doing?
Doctor's office.
Hi. This is Abby Richter calling for Dr. Anderson.
Please hold. Yes, I'll hold.
What are you doing? Why are you calling this guy? No.
Dr. Anderson. Hi, Colin. This is Abby.
Your neighbour from last night.
Hey. Everything okay?
How's the ankle treating you?
Couldn't be better.
I was just calling to let you know how much I enjoyed meeting you last night.
Thanks.
And I was thinking we should go out for dinner sometime.
There is a new French bistro in town...
...and an art opening that got amazing reviews.
So I was thinking we could go on Friday.
Friday...
Would Saturday be better? Actually...
...Abby, the thing is, I haven't really settled in yet.
What are you doing? Saving you. He was blowing you off.
He wasn't blowing me off!
Don't. Okay, he'll be expecting you to call him.
And when you don't, he'll call back.
How do you know? Because I know how men operate.
If you want it to work out with this guy, then you'll listen to me...
...and you'll do exactly as I say. You've done irreparable damage...
...with your psycho aggressive control freak phone call.
It might even be too late.
And if you do salvage the situation, you'll never be more than Abby...
...his desperate neighbour. I'm not desperate.
Why? Did you think I sounded desperate?
Listen to you. Desperately asking me if you sound desperate.
Okay.
Although you won't admit it, you know that I know what I'm talking about.
It's your call, dude.
Fine. What do I do? Pick up the phone and say, "Hey, Doug"
Why would l...? Just do it.
Hey, Doug.
No. This is Colin.
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry. That's perfect.
Who's Doug?
Who's Doug? He's just a guy I'm seeing.
It's nothing serious.
Just a guy I'm seeing. It's nothing serious.
Oh, okay.
Hang on a second. Hang on a second.
Sure.
Now what? Now just make him wait.
If he's still holding on after 30 more seconds, you may have a chance.
No one's gonna wait for somebody they're trying to blow off.
You better be right. Give me time...
...I'm gonna make this guy your bitch. I don't want a bitch.
Colin would never be a bitch.
He is a well rounded man...
...capable of mature emotions and deep, abiding love.
Things which you know not of. Maybe not.
But I do know about lust, seduction and manipulation.
Things that you know not of.
Abby, I'll make you a deal.
If you do exactly as I say, and you get this guy...
...then you'll quit giving me shit and work with me.
You know as well as I do that we could make this show huge.
And if it doesn't work? What do I get?
Then I'll quit.
You're really that confident?
It's been more than 30 seconds.
All right, deal. Now what?
Always make an impression.
Let's get a move on. We have work to do.
But what about the...? In 5 seconds, he'll call back. Come on.
What are you, Nostradamus?
Amazing.
Rule number one: Never criticise.
Even if it's constructive? Never.
Men are incapable of growth, change or progress.
For men, self improvement ends at toilet training.
And rule number two: Laugh at whatever he says.
What if what he says isn't funny? That's irrelevant.
A fake laugh is like a fake orgasm. A fake orgasm is good?
No, but a fake orgasm is better than no orgasm at all.
A fake orgasm is no orgasm. Only to you.
You're not the only person in the room, you know. Let's not be selfish.
Now, that was perfect.
Real or fake? You'll never know.
Rule number three: Men are very visual.
We have to change your look. What's wrong with my look?
Abby, you're a very attractive woman, but you are completely inaccessible.
You're all about comfort and efficiency.
What's wrong with comfort?
Well, nothing, except no one wants to fuck it.
Hello. May I be of assistance? Yes, you may.
We need cocktail dresses...
...tight jeans and some bras that'll make my friend's breasts...
...sit up and say hello. They're not saying hello now?
What are they saying? They're giving more of a passing nod...
...rather than an outright greeting.
You know what? Why don't you try this on?
I think this would be wonderful. Now, that is a bra.
Boobies in this thing say, "Put me in your mouth, I taste good."
I'm actually wearing one right now as we speak.
Length is very important.
We need short enough to see some thigh, but not so short to see vag.
Vag says you're trying too hard. You think?
Jeans are all about the curvature of the ass.
You've, well, you've got the raw materials.
Now all you need is the proper presentation.
Did you just tell me I have a nice ass? Do you have to be so crass?
Jesus.
Rule number four: Never talk about your problems...
...because men don't really listen or care.
Some men care. No, some men pretend to care.
When we ask you how you're doing, it's guy code for:
"Let me stick my dick in your ass."
Oh, I know you think Colin is above it all, but trust me, he's a guy.
If he's even remotely into you...
...he's probably thought about your orifices at least 10 times.
I love how you assume all men are as perverse as you are.
Oh, I don't assume. I know.
Wait. We need to make one more stop.
Why? I have tons of stuff. We have to make your hair longer.
Men like something to grab onto other than your ass.
My hair is fine. There's nothing wrong.
Abby, a ponytail implies that you are either operating heavy machinery...
...or emptying the litter box.
Neither of those things inspires an erection.
Why is it my responsibility to inspire an erection? Isn't that his job?
Shut up.
Well? What do you think?
Not bad. I just...
I don't wanna be perceived as a bimbo. I mean...
And I don't want you to be a bimbo.
You have to be two people: The saint and the sinner.
The librarian and the stripper.
On the one hand, you have to push the guy away with a cold indifference...
...on the other, you have to be a sexually teasing tornado.
Now, we have to teach you flirting. I know how to flirt.
You know how to flirt?
"Oh, my name's Abby, and I love reading Tolstoy.
I also love cats, gardening, and romantic picnics."
I don't think so.
Hey, babe, you wearing any underwear?
You know what? I wouldn't say that, and I wouldn't grab ass.
What's wrong with a little ass grabbing?
I mean, what's it there for if for not me to grab it?
You're just a set of orifices and a pair of teetahs.
And you are a deeply, deeply disturbed person.
Maybe I'm just a really good student.
Would you stop doing that? Doing what?
Running your finger down there. Over me.
Why? Is it turning you on?
Maybe.
It's weird, I think I kind of like it.
Really?
Sucker. Oh, I knew it.
Okay, no teaching the teacher. Come on.
Who is it? It's Colin.
I'm not ready for this. Am I ready?
I'm not ready for this. Calm down.
Okay. Keep the conversation under a minute. Now go.
Under a minute? Under a minute. Yes.
No, wait, wait, wait. Come here, come here.
You're such an asshole.
Hi. Hey.
Wow, you look great. Oh, thanks.
Yeah, I was just doing the dishes.
What happened to you today? What do you mean?
You put me on hold and never called back.
Oh, my God. Was that you? Yeah.
I'm so sorry. It's okay.
Would you mind actually giving me a call a little later?
I'm busy. Gotta get back to those dishes.
Abby, wait. What now?
No, that's good. That'll make him suffer.
Make him suffer. Suffer.
Abby, I was wondering if you'd like to go...
...to the Devils game with me on Saturday.
Go, Comets.
He delivers it.
Okay, I have a visual. Nod if you can hear me.
Just relax. It's gonna be fine.
Now, do exactly what I tell you, and when I tell you to do it. Okay?
You follow baseball? Do something noncommittal.
You okay?
I'm fine.
That was a little over the top, but nice try.
Well, thanks. For what?
Well, thanks for being you.
You're welcome.
Excuse me.
Oh, my God. You're Mike Chadway.
I love you.
Hey, buddy, what the hell? Dude, what the fuck?
Dude, what the fuck? What?
No, no, no. I'm not talking to you.
I'm not talking to you. Okay, did I do something wrong?
No, stop. Listen. Tell him you saw him looking at another girl.
I saw you... I saw you looking at another girl.
Who? That girl, right there.
I was trying to get us a couple hot dogs.
Two. Thank you. Okay.
Okay, we need a quick recovery.
Make sure you put the hot dog in your mouth nice and slowly.
Men like watching penis shaped food go into a girl's mouth.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, God. I'm so, so sorry. No, it's okay.
You know, I can get this out. I'm sure I can.
What fabric is this? I don't know. Cotton?
Cotton. Cotton's the worst. Well, actually, leather's the worst.
After that would be suede. Okay.
I think I can get it out. Abby.
Oh, look, hold on. It's coming!
Where? There. Right there.
Abby? Abby, you might want to look up.
Way to go, Abby.
Okay, I got you. I'm in position.
Can't say today was boring. You're being nice.
I embarrassed you. No.
You're just not what I'm used to.
I know. No, actually, it's a good thing.
I'm used to women I can figure out in five seconds.
But I can't do that with you.
He's an idiot. I figured you out in two.
Now, tell him good night and stick your tits out.
We're gonna give this one last shot. Well, good night then.
That definitely made up for my wet crotch.
Me too. No, scratch that. I didn't have one.
Yeah.
I'll see you later. Yeah.
Okay. Bye.
Bye.
Night. Night.
You did it! You did it! You did it!
I didn't do anything. You did!
It was you. No.
I mean, don't ask me why, but I think he likes you.
He's such a great guy, right? Yeah, he's dreamy.
Yeah. And he fits all 10 of the criteria on my checklist.
Though weren't items one through nine...
...something to do with him pretty much being gay?
I'm gonna ignore that, because I am in such a good mood.
Yeah, I heard. Wet crotch.
Of all the primates, bonobo monkeys are the closest relatives to human beings...
...both genetically and socially.
Especially when it comes to sex.
They use sex as a way to end an argument.
One of my favourite techniques as well.
In fact, when they come upon a new food source...
...they have a gangbang in order to decrease tension...
Small person on set. Thanks.
Which is something we humans should look into.
No, no, no. This is not for children.
It's okay. I know him.
You do? Yeah.
Sit on their asses all day and boss their men around.
Sounds like a great argument for evolution if you ask me.
And that, my friends, is the ugly truth.
And we're wrapped.
Great job, Mike. Thank you. See you guys later.
Yeah, I've got an adult male bonobo monkey in my pants.
I'd like to see that.
Hey. What are you doing here?
I told you no watching the show, especially live.
I need some emergency advice.
Tracy Mclvor asked me to the Sadie Hawkins dance.
Is it dorky if I say yes?
Dorky?
Hell, no. Are you kidding?
You're ahead of the game. Women are coming to you.
You know how cool that is?
Relish this moment, okay?
Now get the hell out of here. I'll see you at 5.
Okay. We'll celebrate.
Don't forget the pizza, King Kong. Hey, have I ever?
He lives with you?
Well, next door, with my sister.
He's my nephew.
Cute kid. Yeah.
Here, do me.
Okay. So guess what? What?
Colin called, he wants to get together again.
Oh, Lord.
So how long should I wait to have sex with him?
Well, the more you make him beg for it...
...the more you're gonna keep him on the hook.
So do everything else but.
But then show him...
...that beneath that control freak exterior of yours...
...that there's a sexual deviant waiting to be unleashed.
No. No, I'm not a sexual deviant.
Good point.
I'm guessing you've been out of practise for what, a year?
No.
Eleven months. God.
Eleven months. How do you live? Come on.
So how often do you?
Do I what?
Do I what? You know...
...flick the bean? What bean?
Your bean. Flick it. Down there.
Gross! That's what you call it? What is wrong with you?
No, well, actually, I call it masturbating...
...but I thought that might offend your delicate ladylike sensibilities.
So how often do you flick it? I don't know.
How often do you flick it?
You're only asking me that so you can picture me flicking mine...
...while you flick yours. No.
I would never picture you while I do that, which is not something I do.
I don't do that, not ever. Yes, you would.
No. No. No. Never?
I find it impersonal.
Abby, what could be more personal than you flicking your bean?
I just don't see myself that way, okay? Okay, well I do.
Come here.
Well, you better start.
Because if you don't wanna have sex with you, why the hell would Colin?
What is this?
What is this, baby?
What? What, baby?
What is this? What is this, D'Artagnan?
"Astrea 1."
"Vibrating brief."
Great.
He said he was running late.
What is he doing here already?
Good, you're ready. For what?
The dinner with corporate.
Didn't you get my e mail? No.
And I can't. I have a date with Colin.
You can't go because you have a date?
You have no idea how hard those are for her to get.
Well, then let's pick him up on the way.
Come on, let's go. Right now. Come on. Come on, let's go.
Sorry to hijack your date, brother.
No worries. You're a producer as well?
No, dude, I'm the talent.
So you're an anchor, then?
No, I do The Ugly Truth.
Hasn't he ever seen our show? Come on, Stuart.
Our show's way too low brow for Colin.
He's a doctor. Yes, that's right, he is.
He doesn't wanna hear about things like implants and oral sex.
You talk about oral sex? Oh, look, we're here.
You invited the Jell O twins? Yeah. I thought it was good thinking.
Well, it certainly can't hurt.
Ladies, you look quite fetching.
Hey, hey, the gang's all here. Hey.
Harold, Bob, you remember Abby. Hi. And this is...
And we all know Mike Chadway. And who are these lovely ladies?
Something tells me we won't be talking about the news tonight.
That's right.
Our table's waiting. Shall we? Come this way.
Mike, you're doing a hell of a job. Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
That's a good one, huh? That is funny.
Thank you.
So you guys here to give me a raise or what?
Oh, that's my guy, always with the jokes.
Yeah.
Yeah. Right.
No, really, we are very excited about this year's rating increases.
And we're hoping that in the next quarter, we can...
Oh, God. What's wrong?
Nothing. Nothing.
Could you excuse me?
Shit. Sorry, she's...
What are you doing? I'm looking for the remote.
What remote? For the...
The underwear.
What? You're wearing them now?
Are you okay? Yeah.
Yeah.
This ceviche, it's so good.
Quite possibly the best I have ever tasted.
Yeah. I'm gonna ask the chef for the recipe.
Abby, hold on.
Tell Harold about the new teaser campaign...
...we're starting next week. You're gonna love this.
Sure. Sure, sure, sure.
Well, they're 15 seconds...
...every hour, on the hour.
Yep. Yep, yep.
They're so...
So...
You tell them, Mike. You should tell them. Yes, yes.
Yes, you tell them.
Actually, I was really enjoying the way you were telling them. It was great.
You were... You were telling them.
What's in ceviche?
They're...
They're unlike anything you have ever felt.
Amazing.
And they're of...
Of Mike telling an ugly truth...
...and they are just so...
So cutting edge.
So... So fantastic. So fantastic!
Oh, God! Oh, it's so, so great!
Oh, God. Yeah! You're gonna love them.
Well, gotta love her enthusiasm, right?
I'm gonna use the restroom, if you'll excuse me.
Sorry, buddy, that's my toy.
Did you know he had it the whole time?
Not the whole time, just part of the time.
I figured I should let you finish. How kind.
So thanks for coming tonight. To dinner.
That kind of coming.
He likes you, by the way. Colin.
I can tell. Really?
We ready to go? Yeah.
I know Abby is. Great.
Let's go.
Take care. Thanks. Okay.
Well, that went well, I think. Sure did.
Yeah. Let's get a drink.
Bob and Harold...
Oh, my God. For me? Oh, my God, he sent you flowers!
Okay. Just conference me when you get a hold of her.
Okay, bye. All right, so we have the balloon festival coming up...
...and for sweeps, it might be nice to do a segment...
...on how men are full of hot air.
Right? It's good, right? No.
We should do some stuff on location...
...because you're great when you're interacting with people.
I'm sorry, did you just say I'm great?
Yeah, you kind of are.
Back at you, babe.
So tell me this.
Why hasn't some fancy New York show stolen you away?
Oh, I much prefer Sacramento to New York.
Come on. You just like being a big fish in a little pond.
No. No.
And Sacramento isn't really a pond, it's more of a lake, or even an estuary.
And it's a great place to raise a family.
Really good school system.
The parks are clean and well maintained and safe.
And there's a much lower divorce rate here than there is in New York.
Yes, well...
Thank God, Colin would never be into a woman like that.
Oh, yeah, I forgot. Colin only likes women of quality, huh?
That's a trait to be admired, not mocked, man whore.
Man whore? Why am I a man whore?
I've seen you with the Funbag Twins, remember?
Saw me what?
What, you saw me introduce them to some network executives?
They wanna be actresses, baby. I mean, who am I to kill their dream?
Such a generous man. You're telling me you've never slept with them?
Well, no, I didn't say that. That's my point.
Men, or man whores...
...prefer women in slutty clothes who suck lots of cock.
Every man wants that.
And for your information, I only slept with the one who could read.
Wait a second, did you just say cock?
Yes. Yes, I did.
I can say cock. You don't own the word. Cock.
Cock, cock, cock.
Okay, I got it.
A week ago, you were crying at the thought of a vibrator.
Now you're "cock this, cock that," cock, cock, cock.
You slept with Colin, didn't you? No. No.
We didn't. We're saving that for this weekend.
He's taking me to Lake Tahoe.
Well...
...here's to overturning assumptions, huh?
I'm really a man of discriminating taste and you're a foul mouthed slut.
Thank you.
So there you have it.
Never assume a girl is easy or assume she's a prude.
There are many layers in between.
And it's your job, gentlemen, to peel back those layers...
...and figure out exactly what type of woman you're dealing with.
That sounded almost enlightened.
Because once you do peel back those layers, my friends...
...her lady garden awaits. And he's back.
And I'm pretty sure you're gonna wanna fertilise that patch of petunias.
Well, thanks, Mike.
Coming up after this message, Javier tells us if your petunias...
...are gonna see any rainfall this weekend.
I sure hope mine do.
I wanna go home, but let's go over the script.
Yeah, let's get it done really quickly.
I'm turned on with the layers. Want to see these layers?
There he is. Hey, what's up?
Good news. You're not gonna believe this.
What? I got you on The Late Late Show...
...with Craig Ferguson. They want you as his guest.
Craig Ferguson wants me on his show? Yeah.
You're shitting me. I am not shitting you.
Oh, yeah. We made it.
Yes!
Hi. Who are you?
Oh, this is Rick.
I'm his agent. Yeah.
Since when do you have an agent? And since when is it okay...
...to book Late Night without the producer's approval?
Actually, it's Late, Late. It's two "lates."
And since he became the hottest personality on morning TV.
Have you seen this guy's ratings? Yes. Yes, I have.
Yeah, okay. Anyways, you leave tonight.
Okay. It's all set.
How cool is this? Come on, let's go.
Oh, my God!
Joy said you wanted to see me?
I found out that Mike's being offered a job...
...at a CBS affiliate in San Francisco at twice the pay.
Craig Ferguson is his audition.
You can't be serious. Oh, I'm serious.
If Bob and Harold find out about this, we're dead.
Now, I need you to fly out there and talk him out of it.
I'm going to Lake Tahoe this weekend.
Don't let him know that you know.
Go ahead and let him do the show, get us our publicity...
...and then convince him that he needs to sign on with us...
...for the next three years. That's all we can do.
Stuart, I'm pulling up. I'm gonna try to catch him.
Okay. I'll call you back.
Thank you.
Hello, little stupid penis face.
You'd be on cable access if it weren't for me.
Here you wanna move to CBS. Is everything okay, miss?
Yes, I'm just... I'm practising my speech.
Abby? What are you doing here? I thought you were going to Tahoe.
You couldn't spend a day without me. Yes.
I just can't get enough of your sparkling wit and charm.
Stuart thought you needed a producer more than I needed to get laid.
Come on, I gotta check in. We leave in five minutes.
Five minutes. Ticktock, ticktock. Yes, dear.
Okay, so let's go over the pre interview questions.
I'm sorry you didn't get to spend time with little Colin this weekend.
And by "little," I don't mean undersized...
...although I highly suspect that's the case.
Colin's penis. That's what you wanna talk about right now?
Because I thought we should talk about what you're gonna say on the show.
Yeah. Okay.
So tell me, Mike, how did The Ugly Truth start?
Well, Mr. Irish Craig Ferguson...
...I had a sales job...
...where I was driving around a lot, listening to talk radio.
I started calling in, and then I realised I'm smarter than everybody else.
Just ask my producer, Abby.
She thinks I'm a genius on days when she's not sexually frustrated.
Yes, thousands of lives have been enriched by your wisdom.
Excuse me, lady, but you have a boyfriend right now because of me.
It may have started because of you, but it's lasted because of me.
You're acting like your normal control freak psycho self again.
I am not a control freak.
When you checked into the hotel, did you or did you not insist...
...on getting an eastern facing room on a floor not below 7?
I like rising with the sun, and a view.
My point is, that Colin likes the Mike version of Abby...
...not the Abby version of Abby.
So don't go knocking my words of wisdom...
...when you're living proof that they work.
I could be having sex right now.
Right this way, please.
Dude, this is awesome. You are about to go on national television.
Okay, this isn't helping, Rick.
Just, you know, do what you always do.
What do I always do? You... I don't know, you...
You entertain people with your moronic ideas...
...and they love you for it.
That may be the nicest thing you said to me.
You're welcome. Next up...
...here to tell us the ugly truth about men and women...
...is Mike Chadway, everybody. Mike Chadway.
All right, Mike. Hi.
Come on up.
Hey, how are you, folks?
All right, Mike, welcome.
Now, listen. Men, we men, I think I can say "we men."
Not necessarily "wee" men, but men of all sizes...
No, I get it. I get it. We're not known for our expertise...
...in matters of the heart.
But I hear you have some very interesting ideas and theories.
What advice would you give to the people out there...
...that are looking for love? My advice would be:
Don't do it.
I mean, try to find lust instead. It's a lot easier and a lot less messy.
Blue balls, they only last a few hours, but a broken heart, that can last years.
Goodness me. Tell me, then. What's her name?
Who?
The woman that screwed you up. She must have been a doozy.
Well, like I said, better a floozy than a doozy.
Hi. I was looking for an Abby Richter.
Did you get him? Is he ours? I'm working on it.
I gotta go.
Where's Rick? I sent him home.
I thought you and I could celebrate on our own. Give me some of that.
And what exactly are we celebrating?
Hello? Craig Ferguson? I was just on it.
I mean, maybe you saw it?
I heard about the offer from CBS.
Well, then maybe you heard I turned it down.
You did?
Why?
Jonah.
You know, he needs me around.
I may not be the best father figure out there...
...but I'm the only one he's got.
And I don't wanna half ass it all the way from San Francisco.
Well, I think that's a very good decision.
Thank you.
Now, can we stop talking about work...
...and maybe relax and drink, enjoy?
God.
Tell me about the doozy.
You know, the woman who broke your heart.
You are just totally trying to kill my buzz.
No, I'm not. I'm just interested in what makes you you.
Well, for your information...
...it was more than just one.
It was more like a parade.
Co dependent girls, unfaithful girls...
...depressed girls, narcissistic girls, phony girls.
Girls who, it turned out, didn't actually like me.
By the time I hit 30, I realised that...
...you can only have so many lousy relationships...
...before you figure out there's no such thing as a good one.
You can't really believe there's no such thing as a good relationship.
To my very core.
Hello. Can I get you something?
I'll have one of those, please. A mojito. Sure.
Would you like anything else? Yeah. Some water.
Okay, would you like still or sparkling?
Tap water's great. Thanks. Tap. All right.
What?
It's the exact same thing, isn't it?
So I've been told.
Come on, let's dance.
No, I'm serious.
I've seen your spazzy dance, now I wanna see the real thing.
No, really. I can't dance like that. I can. Well, kind of.
Oh, Mike, no.
No.
We have an early flight tomorrow. We should go.
Yeah. We should go.
So the car is gonna pick us up downstairs tomorrow at 8.
Do you want me to call you? No, I'll get a wake up call.
Oh, yeah, good idea. Yeah.
I had a really good time tonight. Me too.
Yeah.
My floor. Yeah.
See you tomorrow. Eight o'clock.
Eight o'clock.
Good night. Good night.
Good night. Yeah, good night.
A lot of fun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I guess...
I guess I should go, huh?
Yeah.
Good night.
What the hell was that?
Why do I wanna do it again?
Miss me? Colin.
You were expecting someone else? No.
Since you couldn't come to Lake Tahoe, I decided to come to you.
How did you know I was here? Joy told me.
I just started thinking about all the stuff we were going to do there, and l...
Come here. Decided I couldn't wait.
A little champagne? Yeah.
Great.
So happy to be here. Oh, yes.
What's wrong? Nothing. You just surprised me.
You told me you were spontaneous. Yes, I did.
Have a little something else on its way up for you. You are going to love it.
Let me tell you, it comes out so fast, right?
Oh, wow, I guess we have to get naked sooner than I thought.
I'll get you a towel. Okay.
Abby, I...
Abby, I really, really wanna do that again, and not just tonight.
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Man up, Chadway. Come on, you can do this.
Hey... Hey. You're not room service.
How you doing, man? Hey.
Hey. Good to see you. L...
I just came by to tell Abby about the change in our flight time...
...but I can come by later.
Hi. Hey.
What are you doing here?
Flight's changed.
Eight o'clock in the morning.
I told you that already?
I'm so... Long day, big day.
Okay, I'll just leave now.
Mike. Mike.
Hey, wait.
He came to surprise me. I...
Hey, how convenient. No, l...
I thought it was you at the door.
Well, I guess we're all interchangeable.
I taught you well.
Hey, maybe you could even host the show.
Tell me what happened in the elevator.
Should I tell Colin to go?
No.
No, why pull up anchor now?
I mean, you worked damn hard to get him here.
And that's it? That's all you have to say?
What do you want me to say?
The truth is ugly, isn't it?
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
I'll see you.
Sorry about that.
No. Honestly, no worries.
Just come here.
Listen, the rest of the night is ours.
To the first of many romantic evenings to come.
Okay.
Yeah. Colin, why do you like me?
You're beautiful. You're smart.
You...
You never criticise.
You know what? You never try to control the situation.
And I've gotta say, it's a breath of fresh air...
...because I know so many women who are total control freaks...
...and it's a nightmare.
And I just love that you're not like that. But I am.
I am just like that.
Wait, what do you mean?
Well, this should be chilled.
But you know that.
And as horrible as it sounds...
...I was editing that speech the entire time you were giving it.
And the time you fed me caviar, I was in physical pain.
I hate being fed like a toddler.
That's how much of a control freak I am.
But I couldn't show you any of that, because...
...who would love someone like that?
No one.
I'm so sorry.
You are a great guy, you really are.
Which is why I have to tell you that I have not been myself.
Not for one second of the time that we've been dating.
Then who have you been?
The girl some idiot told me to be.
Morning, Freddy.
What did you do to him?
I didn't do anything. He missed the flight all on his own.
He quit this morning.
I got a call from the local CBS affiliate saying they'd closed a deal with him.
Corporate's having a shit fit. What the hell happened?
He quit to go to one of our local competitors?
We don't need Mike Chadway.
Halfwit troglodytes are a dime a dozen.
You'd better be right.
Because you gotta find me another one or else we're cancelled.
I'll find one by the end of the day.
Not really. I'm just... That's just a joke, everybody.
I can't believe I allowed myself to feel for him.
Well, you felt enough something to break up with Colin. I'm sorry.
Okay, here are the Mike Chadway replacements.
Yes, no, yes, no, no, fuck no. "Fuck no." All right.
So, what do you think of the new set?
I love it.
KSXP retained the copyright to your old segment title...
...so we retitled you: Morning Madness With Mike.
Love it.
And this is Joe, your new producer. Hi.
You know what I like best about you, Joe?
Is I don't wanna have sex with you at all.
I'm relieved to hear that.
How's my face? Is it too shiny?
Which side is better? Right, left, full frontal?
They're all great. Can we go over your intro one more time?
"I'm Jack Magnum, and this is..." "The Ugly Truth."
Okay. Let's maybe lose the gun thing.
What? Gun's my signature move.
Unless the NRA is paying your mortgage this month...
...I say lose the effing gun.
All right, we're live in five, four, three...
...two, one.
Think this guy's any good? He better be.
I'm Jack Magnum, and this is The Ugly Truth.
Peace. Oh, Jesus. He's going political.
We'll do a couple questions with the balloon pilot...
...about how often couples get it on in flight, and then we're out.
Got it.
Check it out. Your replacement's on. Mr. Jack Magnum.
My what? How's it going, Jack?
Your replacement?
Most of you are watching this show so you can learn how to get chicks.
Well, let me assure you, you're in good hands.
You're looking at a guy...
...who personally has had sex with over 137 women.
Most of them conscious.
This is beautiful. Now, we're at the balloon festival...
...and I'm supposed to be telling you about how men are full of hot air.
But I think we all know, it's the ladies that are full of crap.
Just because she says no, doesn't mean she means no.
If that were the case, I'd have only 90 women...
Okay. All right. What the hell?
Did she...?
Welcome back.
It looks like we're experiencing some technical difficulty.
Yeah, when you have a wine festival...
Okay, I got it.
Hi. We're back.
I'm sorry...
... but Jack Magnum will no longer be able to do The Ugly Truth.
Which should really come as no surprise...
...because men are completely unreliable.
What is she doing?
Yes? Yes, Harold? Yes. Yes, I know. We're fixing it.
Take Mike Chadway, for instance.
He up and quit the show without so much as a word.
You think you know what men are gonna do, you think you know...
... what men want to do.
But when it comes down to that moment...
... where they actually need to step up and, I don't know, make a move...
... they chicken out.
I am all over this.
Where are you going? We're live in two. It's going great, isn't it?
The big, strong, brave men that we've all been reading about...
...in novels and watching in movies since we were 9 years old...
...that's a fallacy. They don't exist.
Men are not strong. Men are not brave.
Men are afraid.
It's all part of the show. It's an Andy Kaufman thing we're doing.
Even if they have a moment in a hotel elevator...
... and it's totally romantic and full of potential...
...men are incapable of copping to it.
Because why?
Men are weak.
Let me tell you something about women.
Hey. Woman would have us believe...
...that they are the victims. That we break their hearts for sport.
I thought he quit? That's crap.
See? I told you we'd get him back.
They say they want true love, but all they want is a checklist.
Is he perfect? Is he handsome? Is he a doctor?
For you men who fit the criteria...
... don't kid yourselves, they're not sleeping with you.
They're sleeping with a carefully calculated set of venal choices.
Money over substance, looks over soul.
Polish over principles.
No gesture, no matter how real or romantic...
...will ever compensate for a really impressive list of credentials.
This coming from a man who's never made a gesture...
...other than this one.
Oh, so the elevator wasn't a gesture?
The elevator was a moment of passion...
...followed by a moment of panic on your part, apparently.
Panic? I came by your room. Yes, and then you ran away.
That wasn't panic, sweetheart.
That was an unwillingness to compete...
...with the walking checklist that was in your bed.
You should be thanking me.
We got 10 seconds. Are we ready to soar up, up and away?
Well, there you have it, folks. That's the ugly truth.
A girl in heat for two guys...
...will choose the one with the better résumé.
That is bullsh...
And we're out.
God. I hate you so much, I just swore on live television.
No, you hate yourself for being so shallow.
Off we go. Where are we going?
I'm not going anywhere with you.
Well, that's a shocker, you're bailing. I wouldn't recommend that.
Keep rolling on the onboard camera.
What are you doing? God, what is wrong with you?
They don't even know they're on the air, do they?
Is there any way to tell them they're on the air?
Nope. Oh, they're gonna curse. I know it.
So who wants champagne?
Oh, I know. I got a great idea.
Why don't we pass the time with you telling me...
...how much fun you and Colin had having sex in Los Angeles?
I broke up with Colin in Los Angeles, you jackass.
On our left, you'll see the High Sierras...
What? Oh, yeah. That's got your interest.
If you think we're gonna finish what we started...
...you're out of your mind. You lost your chance.
Oh, come on. I never had a chance with you.
And to our right here, you'll see the lovely Sacramento River...
...winding its way through the dichromatic landscape.
Could you please stop talking? Thank you.
You're right. I had a momentary lapse in judgement...
...when I thought you were more than you are, but you aren't.
Oh, yeah? Well, what does that mean?
"I'm Mike Chadway. I like girls in Jell O.
I like to fuck like a monkey. Don't fall in love, it's scary."
Oh, for God's sakes, there's the first one.
Yeah, it is scary. It's terrifying.
Especially when I'm in love with a psycho like you.
I am not a psycho.
Love?
I just told you that I loved you, and all you heard was "psycho."
You're the definition of neurotic. No. The definition of neurotic...
...is a person who suffers from anxiety, obsessive thoughts, compulsive acts...
...without any objective evidence of... Shut up.
Yet again, I just told you I'm in love with you...
...and you're standing here giving me a vocabulary lesson.
You're in love with me.
Why?
Beats the shit out of me...
...but I am.
Oh, Mike.
You're amazing. I am?
Oh, you're a god.
Really? Oh, God!
Am I really that good?
Or are you...?
Are you just faking it?
You'll never know.
They tore me outfrom my father's arm...
...and took me away.
This moment, I will never,never forget.
We were unloadedfrom the trains,
and boys and menin one queue,
women and childrenin the other queue.
And they told usto move forward...
I was ten months old whenI arrived in Theresienstadt.
At night, we could seethe chimneys were glowing...
You had dead bodiesall laying on the floor.
Well,I hope it's not me tomorrow.
We were starving all the time.
All we were thinkingof was food.
We were supposedto be eliminated...
They got the 10,000 children,took them to Chelmno
and they gassed them and thenthey buried them to mass graves.
I only believed thatthe war was over
when I actually saw German soldierscaptured by the Russians.
And they told me thatwe're going to England.
I didn't know anythingabout England.
- I couldn't speak any... not a word of English- I knew two words.
I know 'OK'...I came with absolutely nothing
because I had no clothesof my own, no toys.
Didn't know where we weregoing or what we're going to do.
This is the last group.
It's been a long day, let's get themsettled as soon as possible.
Welcome!It's warm inside.
Geht bitte weiter, Kinder.Willkommen.
Willkommen in England.
Off you get.That's it.
Welcome to Windermere.
This way.
Welcome. Welcome to...
Ah. Ah...
My dear boy, it's nothinga damp cloth can't sort out.
Now, please...Please follow your friends.
Please remove all your clothesand put them on the pile.
We have to get rid of themfor typhus.
You will be given new clothesin the morning.
Cough for me.
I need you to removeall clothes and shoes.
On the pile here.We've got some blankets...
Next one, please.
Oscar!
Ah.
May I introduce you to Edithand Georg Lauer
kept prisoner with some ofthe children in Theresienstadt.
Edith, Georg,
overseeing our project,our esteemed director, Oscar Friedmann.
Travelling all day,you must be exhausted.
We are glad to finally be here.
Before coming to England,Oscar ran an institution for
troubled boys in Germany.
He has since become quite the expertwith regards to child refugees...
...which is why I asked himto lead this project.
They are going to be herefor four months?
Yes.
And after?
We are working very hard atwhat will happen to them
after Windermere.
Come.You look shattered.
Mr Friedmann.
One of the lads isrefusing to get off.
Refusing?
I tried to explain he's got nothingto fear, but he won't budge.
What happened?
We talked.And now we wait.
And how long you...?
Take him inside,Jock, would you?
This way, Salek.
Come inside.
Come this way.
Now,let's get you seen quickly.
Nurse?
Good lad.
My name is Jock Lawrence.
And you?
Arek.Arek Herszlikowicz.
Arek. And where are...where are you from, son?
Otoschno. Auschwitz.
Buchenwald. Theresienstadt.
He was in four camps?
Again, physically smaller thanwe might expect for his age.
Various scars across his backand arms.
Burn scars.
Damage to the fingers.Healed.
Badly.
Open your mouth please, son.
Four missing teeth.
Several in decay.
Again, almost certainlydue to malnutrition.
Yet another for the dentist.
Problem?
At the last minute, another boyon the flight went back to Poland.
This boy took his place,
but there was no more timeto amend the roster.
Oh, my dear boy,calm yourself.
We shall sort everything out.
In the meantime...
...welcome to England.
Compared to survivorsin newsreels I've seen,
they look more normalthan I was expecting.
Three months ago, you wouldn'thave recognised a single child.
This way, please.
- Mr Friedmann is quite clear.- Girls and boys must sleep separately.
How, when these boys andthese girls are inseparable?
We want them to leave the chaosof their former life behind
and restore order.
And I understand.They will not.
Then we must explain it to them.
May I suggestexplaining it tomorrow?
- Once they and I.- have slept.
Would you prefer me to?I can manage.
Most strangers get a slap.
He must like you.
I...I did not expect suchlittle ones to survive.
They were exceptions.
Hidden.
Living off scraps.
Like rats.
I will be most curious to seehow it has affected them.
Turn around.
Wherever Bela goes,they go too.
Inseparable.
Leonard, you know, the Lauersthink four months is not enough.
Well, you've certainlygot your hands full.
One of the boys said to me,'The reason I am alive
'is because I was strongenough to take bread
'from someone who wastoo weak to eat it.'
The camps taught themsurvival at any cost.
Four months.
Not much time to bring themback to civilisation.
Keeping them all togetherin one place was your idea.
We've achieved that.
I wish I could give you longer.
We raised as muchas we could.
Salek!
Ah, Oscar, if you ask me,they look a tad peckish.
- Hertha! More bread!- What?!
More bread. Let them seeit will never run out.
Do you think every meal'sgoing to be like this?
Let's hope not.
So how do you planto tame them?
'Tame' them?
Jock, they're not animals.
Next.Stand there, please.
Next!
Close your eyes.
Next!
Right, next.
Ey-up!
What's going on here?
You seen these?
Who you looking at, Fritz?
Aw, look.Adolf wants to shake hands!
Go on, shake hands,Malc. Go on.
Now yank the Krautbastard over!
Go on, Malc.Pull a bit harder.
What is he doing?What are you doing?
I'm trying!He's stronger than he looks!
Get off me!Let go!
Hey!
Get off!Lads! Lads!
Come on.Get off!
That's good.Next!
Woohoo!
Woo! Woohoo!
Woohoo!
Mrs Lauer?
Good morning.
I would like to apologisefor the ill-judged comments
I made about the littlechildren last night.
No apology necessary.
I would like to understandthem more.
To that end, I was wonderingif you might bring them
to my classroom to paint.
Paint?
I have developed a therapy wherewe invite children to paint
without instruction or critique.
They choose the coloursand the themes that they want.
I've discovered that this freedomallows their subconscious
to reveal itself upon the paper.
It would be fascinatingto know what...
...the...the little leader...
Bela.
To see a visual representationof her psychology
would be extraordinary.
I am taking them for a walk.
Come with.
What's your name, and whyare you dressed like that?
Perhaps wear sometrousers next time!
He's perfectly friendly!
It's not your dog.It's any dog.
Kinder!
Are these the Jewish childrenwe've been told about?
Some of them,yes. Bela!
We were promisedthat land would be
given back to the local communityafter the war.
Why can't their own peopletake them?
Oh, well, most Jewish communitieshave been established in the cities.
Then send them to the cities.
That is the plan,
once they have been revitalisedwith careful supervision.
It hardly seems fair that weshould have to accommodate
all these foreigners.
Madam...
...are you aware what thesechildren have been through?
The war has beenterrible for everyone.
Not just for you people.
Kinder!
Bela!
Bela!
Come on now!
News-paper.
Newspaper.
News-paper.
Photo-graph.
Photograph.
Photo-graph.
It would be easier if you putout the cigarettes!
Who can say this?
It is a pleasure to meet you.
Window.
Yes.
English girls.
English girls?
He like.
Likes English girls?
Sala.
Watch and listen.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
My name is Rabbi Weiss.
My name is Sala Feiermann.
My name is Benyak Helfgott.
My name is Arek Herszlikowicz.
My name is Itzek Alterman.
My name is...
Ephraim Minsburg!
My name...My name is Chaim Olmer!
Mama...
I wonder if they will ever be freeof night terrors.
Talking about it will help.
Starvation,beatings, shootings,
hanging, gassing.
All these were commonplacein their lives.
What would you say?
Forget about all that and focuson the future?
First, I will listen.
A favourite game of the guards
was to put ground-up glassinto our soup...
..and watch some of us slowlybleed to death from within.
For those of us who remembera life before, these things were horrific.
But these children, they...
..they grew up in that horror.
For them it was normal.
If you ask them how they feel,they might just...shrug.
I get the impression mostdon't want to talk about it.
They are more obsessed withthe fate of their relatives.
Every day they ask whenthe Red Cross is coming.
Very nice.
Lovely.
Come on, lads!Put your back into it!
Is he very good,
or the rest very, very bad?
No real skill.
But from his speed,his balance, his strength,
he's clearly a natural athlete.
Amazing, considering.
Oscar, I've been contacted bythe coach of a Windermere team,
asking if we'd like to playa friendly with them.
A friendly?Aye.
A match played as a gestureof friendship
from the local communityto the children.
Is the team good?
Aye. Not bad.
Well, if you had 11 of him...
...probably.
Surely what doesn't kill themmakes them stronger?
I think they need to experience whatthey can do, not what they can't.
Tell your contact thank you,but no.
Hold the ball!
Hello, love.
Look who it is.Go on, Malc.
You seen this, Malc?
Enjoying English ice cream,are you?
Here's something to remindyou of home.
Georg.
Look at him.
Oh, he's pissed himself!
Enough.
Aye-aye, Malc.
And what do you want?
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
You were attemptingthe Nazi salute?
So? So...
...it is always the right arm.
Trust me, I'm German.
I am also a Jew.
So no Nazi.
Try.
Try!
Higher.
Now...
...the boy you scared so much thathe pissed himself -
he's not German, he's Polish.As are the others.
They watched their families beingslaughtered by the Nazis.
Do you understand?Slaughtered?
You should lower your arms, boys.You look like fools.
None of us can imagine whatthey went through in their short lives.
Not you.
Not me.
I need your word that my childrenare safe to walk your streets.
From man to man.
What do you say?
Well, thank you so much.
Good day to you.
That's very good.Thank you.
That's very good.Thank you.
...'Take me over thereDrop me anywhere'
'Birmingham, Leeds or ManchesterWell, I don't care...'
Come on, girls,I can't hear you singing.
What about you fellas?Just imagine...
..and there's a nice little bit ofstuff waiting for you! Beautiful!
'..Blighty is the place for me... '
Now all together, boys!
'...Take me backto dear old Blighty'
'Put me on the trainfor London town'
'Take me over thereDrop me anywhere'
'Birmingham, Leeds or ManchesterWell, I don't care!
'I should like to seemy best girl...'
Come with me.
Son,I've been a PE teacher
for many years, I've seen a lotof kids play all sorts of sports.
The most you can hope foris a modicum of enthusiasm
and the ability to put the rightplimsoll on the right foot.
The number I've encountered withgenuine physical ability
is small, to say the least.
Do you understanda single word I'm saying?
Plimsoll.
You have natural talent.
But like any natural gift,
you need to work at itto make the most of it.
So here's a book of exercisesfor you to look at.
If you're interested.
No.
For You.
Thank you, sir.
Forget any notionof competence.
Whether the child is a goodor a bad artist is immaterial.
My interest only concernswhat they paint.
How do these compare withchildren who survived the Blitz?
Despite being bombed daily,those children expressed
themselves as you would expectof those in good mental health.
Strong colours.
Clear blue skies, shining suns.
Smiling faces.
They painted happy times.
By contrast, these childrendepict their most painful memories
of losing family and identity.
And extreme violence.
It is as though they can no longeraccess the happy memories
to draw upon.
'Jedem das Seine' was the...
The gate of Buchenwald.I know.
I'm sitting here all day waiting...
...to talk to them,
and here they screamfrom the rooftops.
Before I came here...
...I was determined to
hold their experienceat arm's length,
to protect myself.
But how can you analysethese paintings?
How can you ignorethe suffering on every page?
Week after week, I see this samelevel of extremity.
When I saw this one...
...I was overwhelmedby sadness.
I did somethingI have never done before
instinctively I went to the boyand I held him.
Marie...
We feel compelled to respondas if they were our own children.
How does whatwe feel help them?
Tree.Branch.
Twig.Rain.
Water.River.
Bird.
Flower.
Thank you.
You are welcome.
Kiss.
Lunch.
Hungry?
Always.
Salek...
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Sala?
Salek?
Salek.
Sala.
Sala, eventually,when your strength is fully restored
and you have built a new life...
...you will meet someone who willlove you as much as you love them.
Focus on the game, boys!
Into the centre!All of you!
Come on.
Down.Press-ups.
Now, please.
Right, 20.
Start again, with Ben.
Back on the floor, son.You've barely done five.
You same like guard I knew.
Same voice.
Same face.
Same...
Whistle.Whistle.
Back on the floor, son.
What do you wantfrom me, son?
To go easy on youout of pity?
Is that how you're going to liveout there? Hmm?
How long do you think pity lasts?'Poor refugee children.'
They're not just refugees.Yes, spare me the sermon, Rabbi.
I know what they are.
You think in six months,the real world will care?
Everyone suffered in the war.Not like they have.
Folk don't walk aroundcomparing misery and loss.
Arek!
Maybe no need to shout?
I wasn't shouting. Everyone speakslike this in Scotland.
Ben! Perhaps just leave it.
Perhaps mind your own business,Rabbi. Ben!
I've developed more trainingfor you, more advanced,
now you're getting stronger.
You need to keep pushingyourself, son!
I am 'son'of Moishe Helfgott.
Shot running awayfrom death march.
Years, 37.
I say that not for pity.
For truth.
It's just an expression.
I say it to everyone.
I not want you say it to me.
Please.
Understood.
The war's over, Berish.
They need to move forward.
Not so easy, when everyoneyou love lies in the past.
I trust you enjoyedthe eggs, gentlemen?
I trust you also enjoyed the otherfood that's gone missing?
And the knives, forks, spoons,
plates, bowls, bicycles.
Even a frying panfrom the dining room.
Anything that isn't nailed downor locked up is likely to disappear.
Yes?
A woman has just come fromWindermere about a dog.
What kind of dog?A missing one.
The local communityhas been very good to us.
Stealing from anyoneis completely unacceptable.
But there will be no punishment.
Instead, I will respect youfor having the courage to live up
to your responsibilities.
Did you take the dog?
Go and fetch it, please.
Spare the rod andspoil the child.
Unlike carpets, madam...
...children are not improvedwith beating.
Thank you.
I...am...sorry, madam.
Thank you, Juliusz.
The invitation to a friendlygame of football between us
and the locals to fostergood relations...
Now might be the timeto reconsider.

In autumn, the weathergets cooler.
Who can say this?
In autumn the weathergets cooler.
Come on, lads.Press-ups.
30.
Rozhinkes Mit Mandlen
Well done.
Good luck in America.
We've always knownthis moment would come,
but everything is being doneto help make
the transition from Windermereas smooth as possible.
Everyone is determined to giveeach child the opportunity to live
a full and productive life.
We've made sure that every oneof them has somewhere to go.
I wish I could say I feelthey will be ready to leave.
I feel the same.
Well, what parent ever believesthey have done enough to
prepare their children to flythe nest? True.
Yet every forest floor is litteredwith bodies of young birds
pushed out beforethey were ready.
We are not pushing them out.
Their departure is carefully plannedand equally carefully supported.
Compared to when they arrived,the children are transformed.
Outwardly, aye.
Aye, they're fatter.
Fitter.
They speak somedecent English.
But up here...
Who knows?
You must understand,if I had accepted the government's
original offer, we would be sittingon milk crates in a hall
in Bethnal Green talking aboutten children, not 300!
We have to accept there is neithera bottomless pit of money
from the community, nor infinitegoodwill from the Home Office.
I also want to domore for them.
Six months ago, they lived from onepiece of rotting bread to the next.
Many had given up all hope.
Your compassion and skillhas set them on their feet.
Because of you...
..they now possess the toolsto move on from here
with confidence and hope.
Every day, relationshipsare forming before our eyes...
And breaking apart.Yes, but this is natural.
They are starting to behavelike normal children their age.
In just four months.
It's extraordinary.
I applaud.
I applaud each of you.
Keep up, lads!
Warm up, boys.Gather round.
Keep stretching, lads.
Mr Montefiore?
Mr Montefiore. Have you heardnews on my papers yet?
My dear boy,I have started the ball rolling.
The ball?
The ball is in motion.
The wheels are turning.
With a fair wind and the continuousapplication of elbow grease,
you shall have your papersin your name.
When?
That I can't say.
But I can say...
...eventually...
...welcome to England.
Boot.
Laces.
Fingers.
Hand.
Fist.
Open.
Empty.
Alone.
Family.
Family.
Family.
Grass.
Green.
Trees.
Green.
England is very green.
Throw in, Calgarth.
I hope you've got your medical bag.It's in the car if I need it.
Nice one, lad!Are you OK?
Tiptop, my dear.
Very tiptop.
Thank you.
So kind.
You're welcome.
That's half-time.
One-all.
Have to hand it to you,
your lads have been brutalbut effective.
Haven't they just.
You're doing very well, lads.
Very well indeed.
Individually, you two are a pairof footballing clowns.
But when you work together,you're bloody lethal.
Keep it up.
Same goes for the rest of you--keep those tackles going in.
Might I interject?
Of course.
It's a wonderfulperformance, boys.
That said, this team thatyou've been playing so...
...effectively,
they are the childrenof all those good people.
And without them,
your stay in Windermerewould have been impossible.
So perhaps--and this is merely a suggestion,
Mr Lawrence is your coach,of course, not I--
but perhaps you might considernot breaking anyone's legs
in the second half?
In the spirit of friendship.
What do you think,Mr Lawrence?
Aye.
It's a thought.
Excellent.
Well done.
Well, boys, whatever happens,I'm sure you'll do us proud.
He say we lose game?
No, no. No.
What I think he's saying is,sometimes it's less important
to win badly than to lose well.
Lose well?
To achieve something biggerthan winning a game of football.
You understand?
Go and tell your team.
Did you see that?He just gave the ball away.
What's that about?
Is it a Jewish thing?
I've got it!
Excuse me!
I am looking for Salek Falinower!
Salek?
I was informed that Salek Falinowerwas staying here!
No, this can't be.
Salek!
Chiel?
Bread is life.
None understand thisbetter than you.
Amen.
Thank you, Rabbi.
Ladies and gentlemen,
esteemed guest...
After everything you've lost...
...no children deserve to begiven the world more than you.
But...
...when you leave here,
don't expect anything.
Don't grab whateveryou want from the world
because you feel yoursuffering entitles you to it.
Earn your place in the world,as you have earned the friendships
you've made here.
In Calgarth,
you have forged a new family,
with brothers and sisterswho will be with you
for the rest of your lives.
Take care of one another.
Be proud of who you are,
and what you've overcome.
And even if you struggle withthe darkest of thoughts,
be open to the wondersthat life can offer.
Especially then.
To you, my dear children...
...l'chaim.
L'chaim!
I felt like living again.
More or less, everythingopened up for me.
Erm...
I started feeling likeI'm a human being again.
That's what Windermeredid to me.
The memories are absolutelyindescribable.
After all the hardship andhunger and disease,
good things startedin Windermere.
It gave me a lot,
because I made many friends.
This is the most important,
because I was notalone any more.
Windermere is my first homein England...
...which means that I've alwaysgot an allegiance to it.
I am a citizen of a state.
I am proud of it.
A lot, a lot.
When I show my British passport,I know who I am.
First of all,we will forever be
grateful forthe British Government...
...for giving us the opportunity...
...to go on with our lives.
Give us the opportunity...
...to work here.
We could talk about the past,
talk of our experiences moreso than with anybody else.
Although we always havea little bit of a barney as well!
I'm a happy person,
and also...
...I help...try to help my fellowhuman beings as much as I can.

2020.
Since the 1980s,
it's been a magical year for science fiction writers,
a year of predictions about the future
and the ruthless power of technology.
Humanity would be bound together by a world wide web,
artificial intelligence would exponentially expand
the powers of the human mind,
and the world would be dominated and controlled
by information-based megacorporations
without need for government intervention.
But all of that turned out to be a technocratic illusion
when nature set loose a terrible disease
that took advantage
of the very connectivity we had manufactured.
In Seattle, the day of reckoning was January 20th,
when America's first patient tested positive for COVID-19.
On that same day in Seoul,
the first case in South Korea would also be confirmed.
Korea moved quickly to contain the disease
and save its economy using a variation
on an American plan.
But in the United States,
politics got in the way of science,
Allowing the virus to spread invisibly and fast.
More than 200,000 people have died.
In the first three months of the pandemic,
30 million people lost their jobs.
No more tyranny. No more tyranny.
Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus.
You know that, right?
This is their new hoax.
Who's scared of coronavirus?
- Let go of my fucking cart! - Are you recording me, dawg?
I have the right to buy food without being forced
to participate in a false flag pandemic.
At a moment of crisis,
the world's most powerful nation
didn't rise to the occasion.
It descended into division and chaos.
Back up!
What the fuck is your problem?
Why did the United States
fail to reckon with a danger
for which it should have been so well prepared?
It's one person coming in from China.
It will go away. Just stay calm, it'll go away.
In a couple of days it's gonna be down to close to zero.
We have it totally under control.
It's gonna be just fine.
Breathe in and hold your breath.
Filming during the time of COVID
presented unique challenges.
Okay, and I hold it...
- There's, like, two handles. - Yup.
Wow, you guys have really figured this out, okay.
One work-around was a camera system we invented,
built off-site, and sent to subjects.
We dubbed it 'the COVID-cam.'
So I was able... can I hear you?
- Hello, yeah! - Hi, it's working!
I'm Scott Becker.
I'm the chief executive officer
of the Association of Public Health Laboratories.
How about this? Now, this is really something.
It's an actual board game.
My wife said,
'You know, we should really get it out and play it.'
I'm like, 'We're living through it!
I don't need the game!'
One of the functions public health labs have
is looking for those early indications of an outbreak.
And when did you first hear about the coronavirus?
It was January 7th, I believe,
that I first communicated with some of our staff.
They had sent me an email saying, 'We're watching this.
'We just talked to CDC and they're gonna
be standing up their emergency operations center.'
And I said,'Well, thanks for the update.
'I've been watching this.I'm concerned about it.
And happy new year.'
In early 2020,
Trump was indifferentto the looming pandemic.
He was reckoningwith simmering conflicts
and the upcomingpresidential election.
Time
We begin tonight withthe U.S. and Iran on the brink
for the drone strikethat killed Qasem Soulemani.
Our economy is booming,wages are rising,
poverty is plummeting,crime is falling,
and America is the envyof the entire world.
That you wanna be free
I won't have to cryno more
The whole impeachment thingis a hoax.
It's a total sham.
Yeah, yeah, time, time
This morning, PresidentTrump signed phase one
of a trade dealbetween the U.S. and China.
The pact comes after monthsof escalating tariffs
between the world'stwo biggest economies.
And we just brokethe 29,000 mark on the DOW
just now as we're walking in.
Market's upsubstantially today.
Up until coronavirus,the way that Donald Trump
was gonna win reelection to a second term
was largely going to be onthe strength of the economy.
I covered allof Barack Obama's two terms,
so I was thereduring the Zika outbreak,
the Ebola response.
As a White House reporter,we sort of cover everything,
so, you know, I'vebounced around every topic
that you can possiblyimagine in the Trump term
and had just finished coveringthe president's impeachment
in the House,and the trial in the Senate,
and was thinking that
we might actually geta little bit of a break
on the White House beat,such as it is.
And then a few weeks later,COVID happened.
One of the first indications
that the United Statesgovernment had that
this was a potential problemwas a conversation
that the CDC director,a guy named Robert Redfield,
had with his counterpart,a gentleman
by the name of Dr. Gao,who was essentially the head
of the Chinese CDC, and thatoccurred on January 3rd.
Chinese health authoritiesare still working
to identify the virus behind a pneumonia outbreak
in the central city of Wuhan.
Gao basically said,'Look, this is really serious.
'You need to be aware of this.
It's not somethingwe've ever seen before.'
I heard about a novel respiratory virus
circulating in China,and my ears perked up.
There you are!
I've been at BARDA for about ten years
in the Department of Healthand Human Services.
BARDA's role is to lead the development
between governmentand industry
of vaccines, drugs,and diagnostic tests.
So I'm very interested,and have been my entire career,
of tracking early blipsof novel viruses
that are infecting people.
It's not unusual for us tohear of a new virus emerging
in these wet markets of China.
They can spill over into the human population,
especially the people workingin those wet markets.
But then we started seeingChina take actions
like build hospitals rapidly, urgently.
All I could get at that point was anecdotal stories
on Twitter, for example.
But anyone who'd workedin preparing
for pandemic outbreaks knewthat we were dealing with
something very unusual, very concerning, and very deadly.
You'll get to it.Don't rush.
Here we go.Now you got so exhausted.
So interesting about birds...
we had an earthquake,and they were able to alert us
15 minutesbefore the earthquake.
Because they are connectedto the earth's compass,
so they felt the earth vibrating before it happens.
But you are also a predictor of things before they happen.
Yes, I am obsessed with predicting things,
but that's just partof my mathematical training.
Dr. Lee's training allows her
to act like a canary in a coal mine.
She's world-famous for the wayher mathematical modeling
can predict the likely spreadof disease
and assess the riskof a pandemic.
I have built so many models
to describe manydifferent type of diseases.
When you see the first case,
it does not meanyou only have first case.
It means you have one caseplus many other cases
that you don't see.
It's by the time you have 41 cases,
and it is, like,at the end of December,
then that means you havehundreds of others.
So I was really, reallynervous at that time.
I absolutely believe there's
human-to-human transmission in China.
If there are travelers comingback to the U.S. or Europe
for celebration of new year,that would be truly a vector
to really transmit the diseaseall over the world,
so I do feel that we are marching to a pandemic
in the early part of January.
Starting tonight,we're going to begin
screening passengersarriving from Wuhan
at the three airports
that see the majorityof those passengers:
JFK, San Francisco,and Los Angeles.
Nancy Messonnier was in charge
of public messaging for COVID
at the Centersfor Disease Control, or CDC.
An experienced public health official
and expert in vaccines,
she had played a leading role in the CDC's response
to the anthrax attacks in 2001.
Just this week...
Our laboratory is using genetic sequences
provided by the Chinese.
We're workingon a specific diagnostic test
to detect this virus.
We'll be distributing this test
to state health departments.
This is a respiratory virus.
It is spreadingsilently, invisibly,
person to person,
in the air, on the surfaces.
Every moment counts to be able to recognize
where the virus is
and to learn as much as we can about it
so we can make life-savingvaccines and drugs
and diagnostic tests.
So did the government have some kind of plan or playbook
that they could look to in the event of something like this?
There's absolutely a playbook.
We've updated playbooks through the various years,
and we actually used those playbooks
to exercise what we would do
in an emerging, viral pandemic
the fall before this virus emerged.
'Crimson Contagion' was
a federal government exercise conducted in 12 states.
It simulated a pandemic with eerie similarities
to the coronavirus that was to come.
It was a very thorough exercise,
highly detailed, with a highlylethal influenza virus
that emerged in Asia
and spread quicklyaround the world.
We were getting daily'pseudo-reports'
on the outbreak,the death count.
The mistakes made during 'Crimson Contagion'
played like a preview of coming attractions
for the failuresof the COVID response.
So why did the government failto learn the lessons needed
to preparefor what was to come?
The challenge has always been who's in charge.
We would have disaster leadership group meetings,
where we would bring together
the Health and Human Services network of experts,
and the ASPR would convene these meetings.
Who was, in fact, the ASPR?
The ASPR was Dr. Bob Kadlec.
The threats our country faces in the 21st century
are very real and very serious.
A 26-year Air Force veteran,
Kadlec was a specialist
in biological and chemical weapons.
As ASPR, he downplayedthe danger of pandemics,
cut spending on emerging infectious diseases,
and his officee liminated a program
to manufacture N95 masks.
January 18th,I asked Dr. Kadlec
if we could convene a disaster leadership group meeting.
To my shock, his response was,
'I don't seea sense of urgency.'
I just don't think he thought there was a real opportunity
for this virus to come into the United States.
The same day RickBright reached out to Kadlec,
Kadlec's boss, Alex Azar,
did try to get the president's attention.
Azar was in charge of the CDC and the FDA
as the secretary of HHS,Health and Human Services.
After the previous secretary had resigned in scandal,
Azar was appointed
to bring a businessman's approach to government.
As a former Big Pharmaexecutive at Eli Lily,
Azar was infamous for having tripled the price of insulin.
I actually knew him in grad school.
Very conservative,very ambitious.
Went on to clerk for Scaliaon the Supreme Court.
Within the administration,
Azar was known for his belief that the free market
would meet America's healthcare needs.
We, the government,do not have the solutions
to healthcare.
We're usually the causeof the problems.
With COVID, Azar sensed that the government
might have to play some limited role.
On January 18th, he knew that the president
was leaving town in a couple of days to go to Davos,
and Azar decided,'You know what?
'I think I'd better make sure
the president is aware of this virus.'
Trump was actually on the golf course down at Mar-a-Lago
when Azar called.
Azar's pitch to the president
was one,this could be serious,
but also he wanted to convey a sense of kind of,
'We got this.'
Of those two messages, the one
that President Trump appearsto have really internalized
was the 'we got it' message.
The CDC has identified a case of coronavirus
in Washington State.
Have you been briefed by the CDC...
I have.
Are there worries about a pandemic at this point?
No, not at all,and we're...
we have it totallyunder control.
It's one person coming in from China.
And we have it under control.It's gonna be just fine.
I actually thinkwe were very fortunate
that the first case occurred in the Seattle region.
I sometimes call Seattle sort of the CDC of the West
because there are so manypublic health researchers
and public health people that end up in Seattle,
so in some ways I felt like,'Okay, they're on top of it,
and we're in good hands.'
My name's Alex Greninger,
and I'm the assistant director of the Clinical Virology Lab
here at the University ofWashington Medical Center.
Hello.
Everything about thatfirst case from Washington
was just so positive.
I mean, like... let's go through all the positivity there.
You know,someone self-identifies,
says, 'Hey, I just flew infrom Wuhan and I have a fever.'
The sample was sent overnight to the CDC,
where they turned around a test, which is crazy.
They actually had a test for the virus,
where the genome had just gone online 10 days prior.
CDC also sent a team out immediately
upon that confirmation.
They, you know,looked at all of his contacts
and there wasno onward transmission.
We never identified another case in
the state of Washington untilthe last week of February.
But if you recall,he was not tested
until four daysafter when he became ill.
And he took a share ride back home from the airport,
he had lunchwith his colleagues,
and he did a lot of thingswithin four days.
And so I estimate thatthat is at least in the order
of 2,000 peoplethat has to be tested,
and so we end up missing a lot of the cases.
We're not doctors,but we know a doctor,
and he's actuallyan expert in viruses.
Dr. Alex Greninger at UDub,you're one of the leading...
I just becamean assistant professor,
and so for this new virus, youknow, they sort of invited me
to go on the news to talk about it.
I remember later that day, I was in a second interview,
and like,in the middle of the interview,
the interviewer stopped itand said, 'Oh,
'they just shut down, like,the city of Wuhan
and there's no more transportin and out of it.'
11 million peopleare under quarantine,
and you're just kind of like,'Wow, that just
doesn't even seem likeit's what's gonna happen.'
Like, you've just neverseen, like, a parallel world
like that, what was gonnahappen here too.
How do you lookat that more than one month
of not having any other casesin the state of Washington?
Oh, yeah, it was a total lie.
In terms of, like, you know,whether there was actual, like,
you know, whether there wereno cases there, right?
I mean 'lie' is not the right word,
but just a sort of a...you know, it was a delusion.
The delusion was
that the first COVID patientwas the only one.
In fact, the disease was already spreading
inside the United States.
The challenge for scientistswas to convince politicians
to mobilize the country
to fight a virus no one could see.
In a meeting on January 23rd,
Rick Bright made his pitchto Alex Azar.
My assignment,remember in BARDA,
is to make surethat we start making
drugs, vaccines, and thosetests as quickly as possible.
We were told the CDC wasworking diligently on a test,
and we were relying solely on the CDC.
I raised the need to getstarted immediately
on commercial test development drugs and vaccines,
and the need for moneyto do it.
The secretary looked at me
and said, 'You need money?'
And I said,'Yes, we've exercised
that it would takeabout $10 billion.'
Without that experience and knowledge,
I might not have walked into that room
and asked for those things,
but I knew exactlywhat was needed.
I learned afterthat meeting, actually,
that a lot of the people were pretty offended
that I would come intoa meeting with the Secretary
on day one and ask for money.
And it caused quite a shit storm,
is how it was described to me,
that I ruffled a lot of feathers.
In fact, I wasn't invited backto those meetings
for some time.
In the U.S.,political appointees tightened
their purse strings and hopedthe virus would just go away.
South Korea reactedvery differently.
When it cameto this disease response
here in South Korea,
the politicians largely stayed out of the response
and it was left in the handsof professionals.
After confirming its first case of the new coronavirus,
South Korea is stepping upprecautionary measures.
- Hello.- Hello.
The first case wasa 35-year-old woman
who had entered the countryfrom Wuhan, China.
- Okay?- No.
No?
MERS was a coronavirus
that terrified South Korea,
killing 38 people and sickening hundreds more.
The government was vilified for its response.
Soon after,legislators pursued
a series of critical reforms.
As a result of that,they passed a law
in order to speed up the approval process
of these kits in a time of emergency.
On January 27th,
South Korean health officials summoned representatives
from more than 20 medical companies
to put in place a national testing program.
It was such an urgent request that they just met
in a conference room at one of the train stations in Seoul.
The head of the equivalent of the CDC, he basically said,
'Manufacture methese tests now
and forget about the approval process.'
You know, 'Start using them,start testing.
'We will come back to make sure it's accurate,
but we'll do that while you're already in the field.'
Within a matter of days after that,
the first diagnostic test kit was approved,
and it's a process that typically can take
upwards of a year.
There were four cases at the time,
and it would be another few weeks before there was a death,
but they really felt the need for diagnostic testing
to be able to see where the problem was
and to deal with the threat.
By January 27th,
South Korea was on its way to containing the virus
and preventingan economic shutdown.
Good morning, everyone.
And thank you for joining us here today at HHS.
In the United States,
Azar continuedto emphasize the response
that had so pleased President Trump:
'We've got this.'
The playbook for responding to an infectious disease
outbreak is relatively simple and multi-tiered.
You identify cases,isolate people,
diagnose them, and treat them.
Then you track down all the contacts
of the infected person, and you do the same with those people,
and the same with contacts of contacts if necessary.
It soundedlike a perfect plan,
but it was missinga key detail.
There was no comprehensive national testing
and tracing program.
Even so, the CDC stuck to a version of the script
drafted by Azar.
The CDC will continue
its aggressive public health response strategy,
working to protect the health and safety
of the American public.
Right now, there is no spreadof this virus
in our communities here at home.
Appointed by Trump
after his predecessor leftin disgrace,
Redfield was a controversial virologist
with no experience leading a public health agency.
During the AIDS crisis, he preached a religious approach,
calling for abstinenceas a solution.
With his former assistant,Deborah Birx,
Redfield's attempts to push an unproven HIV vaccine
were twice investigated for scientific misconduct.
Redfield is a little bit of an oddity for the CDC.
The CDC is an institution filled with scientists
and researchers who don't like to be told that science has
to compromise for economics or for politics.
You know,they want to be purists.
Donald Trump is a president who has expressed
an incredible disdain for science
since before he took office.
Inside the West Wing,
they refer to the CDC as the Deep State.
Certainly many of the people at the CDC saw Redfield
as not having the kind of backbone that they would like
to have seen in a CDC director
to stand up to the president
both privately,but also publicly.
Some scientists were willing to push back.
Public health officials from around the country
shared doubts that the CDC was responding to the virus
with enough speed and concern.
They circulated an email chain,
which included Trump officials, called 'Red Dawn.'
What's going on here,my friend?
It was atongue-and-cheek nod
to a 1984 movie about a small band of American citizens
who fight back against a Russian invasion.
This is the Emergency Broadcast System.
We are under attack by...
We were a little bit like the Wolverines
from that movie.
They know who all of you are.
They're looking for you.
A group of teenagers that are fighting back,
and one of us thoughtit would be funny
to use 'Red Dawn'as the subject title.
That email chain, it's a group
of former and current state and local officials
within the federal government.
These are all very dear colleagues that have been
in public health and emergency response for a long time.
In late January, we were consciously monitoring,
trying to assess when it hit us,
how big the scope of the calamity
that we are looking into.and how to mitigate it.
I think in January,
the cat was alreadyout of the bag
in terms of we had casesin the U.S.,
we had human-to-human transmission going on
in the U.S.,
and we were going to bedealing with COVID-19.
I mean, I wasn't able to sleep.
I couldn't stop thinking about
what could go wrong for us.
The 'Red Dawn' emails would be full
of warnings and recommendations
from experts in pandemic response.
But politicians failed to recognize
that there were lessons to be learned.
There's never been anything like this in history.
There's never been and nobody has ever seen anything
like this.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
To be ready for the perils of the future,
all one had to do is look clearly at the past.
In 1918,in the midst of war,
influenza marched across the earth from country to country.
Epidemic lurked everywhere.
To ward off contagion, special precautions were taken.
With no vaccine and few treatment options,
simple but effective precautionary measures
like masks were all people had.
The H1N1 flu infected 500 million people,
1/3 of the world's population at the time.
The death toll can only be estimated
somewhere between20 and 50 million people.
Since 1918,scientific advancements
like the invention of the electron microscope
have allowed us to seethe 'invisible enemy.'
But even with vaccinesand advances in pathology,
the growth of global transportation
made other pandemics ever more likely.
In 2003, a deadlySARS coronavirus
spread from bats to humanswas quickly contained.
In 2009,the Obama Administration
faced a challenge when a new strain of H1N1 emerged.
Good afternoon, everybody.
There's no doubt that every president should learn
from what has happened before.
President Obama felt it very important from the beginning
and all the way through our dealing with H1N1
that the scientists make the calls.
H1N1 influenza is here.
I'm Dr. Tom Frieden.
I directed the CDC from 2009 to 2017.
I just sprayed downthe chair with Lysol.
All right.
We dealt with epidemics
of Zika, Ebola, MERS,and H1N1 influenza.
Our Emergency Operations Center was activated
more than 90% of the time that I was there.
That's the way of reducing exposures,
if there is a lot of H1N1.
We do think there maybe some challenges, though,
practical challenges.
President Obama made it very clear that HHS was in the lead
and that I would be the spokesperson for the flu,
as he would call me,the face of the flu.
H1N1 was very scary
because children were particularly vulnerable.
Hi, it's Elmo.
And I'm SecretaryKathleen Sebelius.
Elmo and Secretary Sebelius...
Teaching kids to sneeze into their elbows was a big thing.
First, you learn to sneeze into the bend of your arm like this.
- Achoo.- Oh, very good.
13,000 Americans died from H1N1
and the Obama Administration
mishandled vaccine distribution,
but scientists gave the administration high marks
for moving quickly
and being open with the press and the public.
Just four years later,
the Obama Administration's response to the Ebola crisis
would be criticized for being too slow.
In the case of EbolaI remember being in the room,
in the White House briefing room.
You guys are up here talking about,
'We have this great and perfect system that's going
'to be able to, you know,contain this virus
because we've done all this preparation,'
and yet it doesn't look like it's working.
Hindsight is always 20/20.
I can look back at any outbreake worked on
and say, 'I made a seriesof mistakes there.'
We all do, but the key is,
are they unforced errors?
I think it is important to reflect
on whatever lessons we learn,we build and incorporate.
After the Ebola crisis passed,
the Obama National Security Council had essentially
created a unit withinthe National Security Council
dedicated to sort ofpandemic response.
No, I cannot see Ben.
I can see his hand when he moves it out here,
but he's got a face shield on.
It's pretty good.Hardcore.
Beth Cameron was in charge of countering
biological threats for the Obama Administration.
We set up a new directorate
on global health securityand bio defense,
and I was honored to be able to lead that directorate,
and also to be able to take on a lot of the lessons
that we really had learned after the Ebola epidemic.
In 2016,
Beth Cameron and her team at the NSC
drafted a 69-page playbook on how to deal with a pandemic.
The playbook was intended
to allow people in the White House to ask questions.
What should we do?
And also,what do we need to do
to get ahead so that we're not constantly reacting?
So what happened to this playbook?
So the playbook is reported to not have been used.
The Obama Administration did not leave
to this administration any kind of game plan
for something like this.
I have no idea why Mitch McConnell said
that he didn't knowabout the playbook.
There were a large number of copies
that were spiral bound of this playbook.
It was briefed tothe in coming administration.
It did become politicized.
Some have erroneously suggested
that the Trump Administration
threw out the pandemic response playbook
left by the Obama-BidenAdministration.
What the critics failed to note, however,
is that this thin packetof paper was replaced
by two detailed, robust,pandemic response reports
commissionedby the Trump Administration.
The last thing that they wanted was to pay attention
to what the Obama peoplewanted them
to pay attention to.
They were trying to make a clean break
from what they sawas a disastrous presidency,
and this wasthe Trump presidency.
And I'm proud to be An American
Where at leastI know I'm free
I think it's importantto understand
that biological threats are not the thing
that is always top of mind for a senior leader.
And I'd gladly stand up
But there really was a lot of pressure
on all of the civil servants
in between Barack Obamaand Donald Trump
to explain why we needhigh-level officials
who are looking at that issueall the time.
After I left, I continued to work with the Trump team
in my new positionout side of government
until the directorate was dissolved in May of 2018.
The Global National Security Team was disbanded
under a reorganization
by Trump's National Security Advisor, John Bolton.
It was really shocking that any administration
would get rid of so much experience and expertise
and the collaboration and coordination
that comes with that...those years.
From the moment of Trump's inauguration,
the guiding slogan of staffing was not 'you're hired,'
but 'you're fired.'
Key positions went unfilled.
Many more were eliminated.
And when people were hired,
experience was not nearly as important as loyalty.
On January 29th, the WhiteHouse announced the formation
of an official task force
to confront the threat of the coronavirus.
Well, good afternoon,everyone.
I'm Alex Azar.
Led by Azar,
the task force had little scientific expertise.
Most were businessmen and lawyers, seemingly chosen
for their politicalor religious beliefs.
One had been Sarah Palin's foreign policy advisor.
Another was a climate change denier
who opposed homosexuality as an act against nature.
The only two public health officials
were Redfield and Dr. Anthony Fauci.
At the National Institute of Health,
Fauci had advised six presidents
and had been at the forefrontof every epidemic response
for the last 40 years.
The issue now with this is that there's a lot of unknowns.
As you can see just from the media,
the number of cases have steeply inclined
each and every day.
At the first briefing,
they announced no concrete programs
to contain the virus
inside the borders of the United States.
Instead, they offered a variation
of a familiar Trump refrain...'build a wall.'
Foreign nationals,other than immediate family
of U.S. citizens and permanent residents
who have traveled in China within the last 14 days
will be denied entry into the United States for this time.
In the months after that,tens of thousands of people
from China still make their way into the United States,
mostly Americans who are returning home
and are not blocked by that ruling.
'Diamond Princess,'this is your captain speaking
from the bridge.
We have been notified that
10 additional people
have tested positive for coronavirus.
The captain of the 'Diamond Princess'
had docked his vessel in Yokohama
after learning a passenger had tested positive for COVID-19.
The Japanese government ordered a 14-day quarantine.
Eventually,over 700 passengers
would test positive.
That made the 'Diamond Princess'
the largest known outbreakof the virus outside of China.
Donald Trump, save us.
Get us a government-based airplane.
- Not even that, just like...- Get us off the ship.
I received a phone call
that a disaster medical assistance team
was being assembled to do a rescue operation
to go pull American citizens off of the 'Diamond Princess'
and bring them back to the U.S.
And I was asked if I would be willing to go
as an expert to go help the team.
Okay, they've got a bunch of people in white coats.
They're not white coats.They're white hazmat suits.
They're white hazmat suits.
They've got these little tunnels down here.
The E.T. Tunnels, I call them.
At the time, we still didn't know a lot
about the transmission dynamics
or even the severity and lethality of the disease.
The 'Diamond Princess'confirmed
many, many of what I was nervous about.
First of all, it shows
how it spread in a confined environment
with lots of people, right?
Even though all of them has their own cubicle,
but that's exactly like apartment complexes
in New York City,and you go out, right?
You go to places confined in a mall, and in classrooms,
in dormitories,in many, many settings.
It basically gave us a very parallel world
of what could be happening to us.
Even after the ship went into quarantine
and passengers were really restricted to their rooms,
the fact that the outbreak continued to grow demonstrated
that there may be more to transmission phenomenon
than we initially thought.
So when we saw that,that really hit home to us
that this is a pretty explosive situation.
Okay, they quarantine, but yet the spread is like fire.
It shows... it really highlights strategic tests is a must.
Eva Lee began to sound the alarm
in the 'Red Dawn' emails about asymptomatic spread
and the need to test widely.
She knew in early February
what federal officials refused to recognize.
Only a vast infrastructure for mass testing
could spot and contain a virus
that was already moving invisibly across the country.
Then I thought to myself,'That is it.'
We will have no chance to contain.
If we are not going to take actions now,
we would regret and we would be late, late, late.
The trifecta is test,trace, and isolate.
You need to have all three of those working in tandem
to be able to take down any infectious disease.
I'm from Hong Kong,
and I grew up during SARS,
so I guess that was my first experience with an outbreak,
which has turned out to bean interesting reference point
during this outbreak.
My boss was like, 'You should cover the coronavirus.'
So my question's gonna be,
where are we deviating from the playbook?
That's where I hold the government accountable.
So the CDC made a test that worked in their lab
before the first case of COVID
landed in the state of Washington on January 20.
What they saw as their next step was sending test kits
based on their design
to public labs around the country.
So CDC can't just make a test and send it out.
They have to apply for Emergency Use Authorization.
This week, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization
for the CDC's diagnostic test.
Having a declaration of an emergency
allows you to, like,cut through a lot of red tape
where, like, you don't have to
approve things the traditional pathway,
which takes many, many years.
So it's like going through the precheck line at the airport.
FDA issued the EUA to CDCreally on February 4th,
and test kits were available on the 5th.
The test kits will start shipping
to the over 100 U.S. public health labs.
Each test kit can perform up to 800 patient samples.
It works in about four to five hours' time.
And that's pretty heroic, in two weeks,
to develop test kits for the country.
So, so far,speaking of the playbook,
everything was going right.
The first thing public health labs have to do
after they get the test is they have to verify
that the test works in their hands,
in their laboratory,with their scientists.
So on Saturday, February 8th,
labs opened up their boxes
and they started to get the test up and running.
And then, the next morning,
I see a number of emails
from public health laboratory directors saying,
'We're seeing this problem with one of the components
'of the test, the N3,
and is anyone else seeing that?'
Then my phone started to blow up.
It became apparent that we actually had a real problem.
And I thought to myself,
'Oh, my God.
This is a nightmare.'
There were many labs that were having the same problem.
So that was an indication
that this was coming from the CDC labs.
There are three components to the CDC-designed tests.
They are calledthe N1, N2, and N3 assay,
and the N1 and N2 assay,together,
look specifically for the COVID-19 coronavirus.
And then they had a 3rd component, the N3 assay,
which was designed to look for any coronavirus.
And I don't know why they decided
to throw that third part in.
They didn't need it,but that third part
is the part that caused all the problems.
It was a contamination problem.
This was just a huge lightbulb moment
where... wow, we could really be on pause.
The CDC says they're working with states now
to fix the tests.
They did not say how many of the kits have flaws.
Now, this was really frustrating
to a lot of lab directors because they were like,
'Look, the N1 and N2 part of this test are working
'totally fine,
'so why don't we just ignore the part
that isn't working?'
Under an Emergency Use Authorization,
you're not supposed to do that.
You have to run that test exactly as it's assigned.
As it turned out,
over 90% of public health labs
had tests that were not working.
So it was really as if we were flying blind,
and we knew it, and frankly,
there was nothing we could do except wait.
There was a working effective test
that was created in a German laboratory
that was being distributed by the World Health Organization
to countries all around the world.
It is available now
and we are shipping an essential component to labs
to really start working immediately.
The WHO test quite frankly is used
for low and moderately income countries.
I think it would'vebeen very unusual
to use another country's test,and not for political reasons.
Just, I guess, because of maybe scientific hubris.
We've never had a failure like this.
Despite the technical problems at the CDC,
the Trump Administration could have insisted
on an alternate plan.
Public labs could have pivoted to the WHO test
or removed the N3 element.
Test manufacturers and clinical labs
were eager to start making their own tests,
but for reasons that remain unexplained,
the FDA put the brakes on the approval process.
Yeah.
Looks like the setup is pretty good.
Oh, good, doctor approved?
Yup, exactly.
My name is Taison Bell.
I'm an infectious disease and critical care physician
at the University of Virginia.
I'm the director of the COVID ICU.
It's really important to know
who's positive in the community
and to be able to test in awide spread, aggressive fashion
so we can really stop the chain of transmission
of the virus.
Traditionally,there's a lot of leeway
when it comes to federal regulations
and hospital laboratories' ability
to set up their in-house testing,
but the thing about the emergency declaration
was that it made the diagnostic innovation
more difficult because now it had to go through the FDA.
So now, all of a sudden,
any university laboratory that has the experience
and the know-how to set up their own in-house testing
now has to clear it in order to make this work.
We're not a public health lab.
As a clinical lab,we're not part of this system.
You know, the CDC and the state public health labs
are fantastic,
but clinical labs,
like hospital clinical labs,commercial labs,
perform 90% to 95% of testing.
We really are the front lines of the public health system,
and so it's really important
that we're a part of that conversation as well.
So we're trying to figure out, is it better
to just deal with the FDA and the backlog there
and set up our own in-house testing,
or do we just wait for the CDC
to fix the issues with the test?
We decided initially to wait,
and that was the wrong decision.
Many labs gave up
rather than face the thicket of bureaucratic rules.
But Alex Greninger did not give up,
and instead began
to slog through the FDA regulatory process.
So at that point, you had to really go fully in.
You gotta make your own test.
So we got the template and the paperwork.
You couldn't get the comments back
until you mail inthe document.
Even though you'd email a document,
you had to burn it to a CD or a USB
and physically send the document as well.
The original process suggested
testing 50 positive samples,
but in that case in the U.S.,there were 14 known cases.
But even getting that one sample,
that one positive sample,was the hardest part.
And obtaining clinical material from the CDC
is very difficult.
And I think that was when you realize
that the FDA and the CDC maybe hadn't talked a ton.
Swing your partner around and 'round.
And around.And around.
While federal agencies failed
to talk to each other, the virus swirled in mid-February
through a series of square dances in suburban Seattle.
With every do-si-do,the virus changed partners.
But without testing,
scientists couldn't follow the spread.
The emergency steps meant for speed and innovation
slowed the process down to a crawl.
The White House could have cut through the red tape.
The mystery is why those in power
didn't force the bureaucracy to find a quick solution.
While we were on pause,
the anxiety level of our members just increased
exponentially, day after day.
There was just more frustration, concern,
frankly sadness,because we weren't
able to do our job.
That was really tough.
While testing in the U.S. was stalled,
in South Korea, the government was already moving
to contain the virus by utilizing
a comprehensive national testing and tracing program.
I think they did a much better job.
I think starting from the testing roll-out,
a lot of our jealousy early on
was just how rapidly they were able
to test a large proportion of their population.
And they were testing
relatively younger asymptomatic people
as well as older people who had more severe diseases,
and they were able to do contact tracing.
Because of the laws that were passed in 2016,
enabling contact tracers to obtain vast amounts
of information in the name of disease control,
there was a large amount of data
that authorities here can access.
Cell tower information,
CCTV footage,credit card data.
And this information was pushed out
to the general public using cell phone alerts.
To glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera
Is here
If two people singing
could spread the disease,
imagine thousands singing in one room.
A major outbreak was traced to the Shincheonji Church,
a dooms day Christian cult.
Led by a self-proclaimed messiah, Chairman Lee.
- Hallelujah.- 'Hallelujah.'
The Korean government descended
on the city of Daegu,
where the church hadits primary place of worship.
By testing, tracing,and isolating
the followers of Chairman Lee,
officials tried to prevent the virus
from spreading to the rest of the city.
Thousands of additional people had been exposed.
It led to South Korea's numbers soaring.
Because South Korea had already started ramping up
diagnostic test production,they were able to seek out
every member of this church in Daegu
and get them tested.
The President of South Korea has put the country
on the highest possible alert after the number of cases
jumped to more than 760 and the death toll rose to 7.
Because of the surge of cases in Daegu,
South Korea started opening up these centers.
Drive-through testing
and special testing booths protected healthcare workers
while dramatically increasing testing capacity.
And manufacturers were able to keep up with the volume.
South Korea also stepped up production of PPE
to protect health workers and the public alike.
Early adoption of testing would save South Korea.
At the same moment in the United States,
testing was still halted,and the nation was blind
to where and how the virus was spreading.
Because of all we've done,
the risk to the American people remains very low.
When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days
is going to be down to close to zero, we're doing great.
Other countries have not been doing great.
Our consumer is very, very strong,
very powerful economically.
Underneath the booming economic wave
was an invisible undertow of disease.
By mid-February,pandemic models indicate
that there were thousands of cases spreading
through Seattle, Chicago,San Francisco, and New York.
By mid to late February,the sort of top experts...
Robert Redfield,Nancy Messonnier,
Anthony Fauci, Azar...
they decide,'We gotta tell the president
'that we have to become more aggressive
'about warning the American public
that this is where we're headed.'
The problem was the president just that next day
left for another foreign trip to India.
Well, I look forward to being with the people of India.
We're gonna have many millions and millions of people.
They wanted to brief the president obviously
before you sort of made this sort of...
right turn on messaging.
Yeah, we'r every much involved.
We're very...
very cognizant of everything going on.
We have it very much under control.
Thank you very much, everybody.
And the doctors knew that this wasn't the kind of thing
that you brief over the telephone,
so they decided,'We'll set up a briefing
for the president the day he gets back.'
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi
rolled out the red carpet for President Trump.
Namaste.Namaste.
President Trump often judges events based on their size.
The bigger the better,so it's fitting
that this stadium was absolutely packed
with more than 100,000 people.
The rally kicked off a whirlwind trip
packed with the pageantry that the president so loves.
As of this morning,we still have only 14 cases
of the China coronavirus
detected here in the United States.
We have three cases
among Americans repatriated from Wuhan,
and we have 40 cases among American passengers
repatriated from the'Diamond Princess' in Japan.
We're trying to engage in radical transparency
with the American public as we go through this.
This morning, Dr. Messonnier from the CDC
provided the usual tele-briefing.
There was a bit of confusion,
and it was Nancy Messonnier's understanding
that the green light had been given
for that new message
to be delivered before briefing the president.
So at her next conference call for reporters,
she went to town.
I remember being shocked,
thinking, 'Does she realizewhat she just said?'
I can't say that I know
what was in Nancy Messonnier's mind,
but it wouldn't be hard to guess
that there must have been a level of frustration
built up inside the CDC
about a president who doesn't take this seriously.
I mean, you know,that was palpable.
Statements were made for the first time
to prepare the psyche of Americans
for what we, the scientists,knew was coming.
It was a turning point in this outbreak
because the truth was finally broken through that shell
of so many people standing there every day
telling Americans,'We have it under control.
'We have it contained.It's not a problem.
It's going away.'
Those were the messages every day up until that point.
She gives that briefing at virtually the exact moment
that Trump is walking up the steps
on 'Air Force One' in India.
On a larger scale,communities and cities
may need to modify, postpone,or cancel mass gatherings.
Nancy Messonnier's comments tank the market.
1,000 point drop in the DOW.
Stocks fall sharply as fears spread
that growing coronavirus will slow the global economy.
It was essentially a kind of freak out.
The stock market taking another beating
after a sharp new warning from the CDC.
Also, tonight...
Trump doesn't like to be surprised.
The one gleaming,wonderful thing
that was giving him and his advisors hope was the economy.
It was the silver bullet.
That was how he was going to win a second term.
That, combined with Messonnier's threat
of what she was suggesting...shut the country down...
'You're saying something
'that's gonna threaten the economy,
and by definition,threaten my reelection.'
It's an 18-hour flight back.
By the time Trump lands,
the whole thing had spun out of control, and he was livid.
He calls up Alex Azar,wakes him up,
screaming at him...what had happened?
'Do you know Nancy Messonnier
had scared the shit out of people?'
The CDC said yesterday that they believe it's inevitable
that the virus will spread in the United States,
and it's not a question of if, but when.
Do you agree with that assessment?
Whatever happens,we're totally prepared.
We have the best people in the world.
Notably missing
from 'the best people in the world'
was Dr. Nancy Messonnier.
It didn't surprise me that the moment she said that,
that she would be removed from that platform.
I'm going to be announcing exactly right now
that I'm gonna be putting our Vice President, Mike Pence,
in charge.
I'm gonna ask Mike Pence to say a few words, please.
Thank you.Mike?
After the episode with Nancy Messonnier,
when Pence's team takes over from Azar,
essentially the message gets contained.
Not in the least.
I was delighted that I get to have the Vice President helping
in this way.
Delighted.Absolutely.
Now at the helm of the task force,
Pence promptly promoted Deborah Birx,
a doctor and a diplomat,to be a spokesperson.
Dr. Birx, who is our right arm at the White House on this,
and frankly, one of the leading experts in the world
on infectious disease,I think is...
Pence trusted Birx
on account of her Christian faith and political instincts.
She'd become a go-to-explainer for a White House interested
in packaging science to serve partisan goals.
We really want to understand
where the virus is spreading,who we have to protect,
who's the most vulnerable.
That would have been easy to understand
if there had been a national testing program,
but that was still stalled.
While countries all over the world
were testing thousands of cases,
the United States was testing fewer than 100 a day.
At that stage, the only labs across the country
that could legally test for COVID
were a few public health laboratories
and the CDC itself.
The frustration was just boiling over,
and I remember going to these meetings
with our clinical lab director,
and she's literally on the phone with the FDA and the CDC
like, 'You need to help us!You need to help us.'
After almost a month
of labs across the country being unable to test,
the Trump Administration finally made a decision
it could have made weeks earlier.
On February 26th,
the FDA and the CDC laid out the strategy,
and that was that we would be able to get up and running
by using the original test kit,
but by throwing out the N3 component.
Overnight with, you know,
with some crossing out of lines on some paper,
the same test kits that had been shipped out
to the state public health labs were functional.
That amended EUA was Wednesday, February 26th,
and you can watch the testing curve in the United States.
I mean it really didn't start going up
until that week.
Here in Washington State at the state lab,
they had positive results the very first time
they performed authorized tests.
After desperate please
from health care providers,
the FDA also relaxed regulations and
let manufacturers and hospital labs use their own tests.
But it was too little,too late.
The disease had spread to half the states in the country.
And test kits were in such short supply
that they were limited to patients
who met rigid guidelines set by the CDC.
Early on, our testing was limited to people
who had traveled from China,or they had had contact
with someone who was known tested positive for COVID-19.
So written in our guidelines,
by necessity because we had a strained testing supply,
it was designed to misscommunity transmission,
meaning transmission that happens
throughout the community that's not connected to travel,
that we know at some point's gonna happen.
And it's like we're looking in this area,
and we know that transmission's gonna happen
over here, and we're gonna miss it
because we can't test for it.
On February 27th,
the new testing recommendations came out.
Do you mind removing the mask?
- Is that okay?- Oh, no, not at all.
Didn't know what your rules of engagement were there, so...
The new addition was this line that said,
'If you have severe lower respiratory pneumonia,
'severe pneumonia or ARDS...
'Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome...
you should consider testing.'
With the updated guide lines,
we initiated testing in two individuals,
and both of those individuals tested positive.
So that evening after we got the first two back,
we looked around the intensive care unit and said,
'Okay, who else is sick with pneumonia
'that has not been diagnosed with influenza
or another respiratory virus?'
And we selected nine more individuals.
Eight of those turned out to be positive for COVID.
It was an astounding revelation.
The revelation was that while testing protocols
were on hold, the disease had spread uncontrollably,
which would lead to economic disaster
and loss of tens of thousands of lives.
The real question is,did more people die?
Did more dislocation and economic problems
and societal change have to happen than did?
The period that in our reporting
that we have called'The Lost Month,'
that really was the time
when things happened in the United States
much more slowly than they happened in,
for example, South Korea,
and it became impossible to do containment.
Because the U.S.failed to contain the virus,
state governments moved to lockdowns
to avoid runaway contagion
and to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed.
Over 100,000 small businesses would close and never reopen.
7 million Americans would be infected by the disease.
But back in late February,the government refused
to confront the reckoning that was about to come.
We have done an incredible job.
We're going to continue.
It's going to disappear one day.
It's like a miracle.It will disappear.
The president is also quoted by saying,
'The virus we're talking about having to do,
'you know, a lot of people think it goes away in April
with the heat.'
Dr. Fauci, does this go away in April?
If it acts like influenza,
the heat will actually make it diminish in its impact,
but we have no way of knowing how it's gonna act.
Does the CDC agree that this is a problem
that is going to go away without intervention?
I think it's prudent to assume
that this pathogen will be with us for some time to come.
The President's expressing confidence this team,
the public health infrastructure in this country,
state and local,that we can deal with this.
We will prepare for this.We will work together on this.
He's trying to calma public that...
we see in China, panic can be as big of an enemy as virus
in these situations,
and so there is always that balance to...
Mr. Secretary, I don't want to panic over this either.
The stock market's crashing.
He's out right contradicting
everything that you all have just said.
Out right contradiction!
I think he's expressing confidence in...
With no medical basis for it!
That's what you've just explained to us.
Come on, sir.
The gentleman's time has expired.
You're doing a great job for the president, Mr. Secretary.
Now the Democrats are
politicizing the coronavirus.
You know that right?Coronavirus.
One of my people came up to me and said,
'Mr. President,they tried to beat you
'on Russia, Russia, Russia.
They tried the impeachment hoax.'
And this is their new hoax.
And so far,
we have lost nobody to coronavirus
in the United States.
Nobody.
The next day,that would change.
Today, Public Health... Seattle and King County... is announcing
three new presumptive positive cases of novel coronavirus,
COVID-19, including one person who died.
We have expressed our condolences to the families
of the individual who has passed away.
It was one of the firsttwo patients diagnosed,
it was my patient,and all we saw was a future
of extremely ill individuals like this.
So it was a challenging moment,
a daunting moment,to come to that realization.
Today, health officials in Washington State
announced four new deaths,bringing the total to six,
all in the Seattle area.
By early March,King County, Washington
had become the epicenter of the coronavirus in the U.S.
due to the Lifecare Nursing Home.
They're not answering the phones, the lines are busy.
All the families are really worried,
not knowing if our loved ones are even alive.
It was a blur of activity.
We realized that our hospital
was now the tipof the iceberg.
We soon found outhow deep that iceberg went.
Because test kits were in short supply,
access was limited to patients
who were dangerously closeto respiratory failure.
The death count began to rise.
COVID began spreading
to health care workersand first responders.
The job situation put them at increased risk.
Nurses' aides in nursing homes
without the protectiveequipment or training
they neededto be safe and secure.
Individuals who have jobs
that were considered essential jobs,
they're stocking grocery shelves
and helping to pick up trash in communities
and sweep the streets.
While many affluent Americans
worked on computers at home,
low-paid essential workers,
many without masks and the ability to distance,
were jammed into sites of contagion
like delivery depots,industrial farms, factories,
funeral homes,and meatpacking plants.
If the impact of the disease was divided by occupation,
it was also sundered by age and race.
My grandmother used to say,
'You know, when the country gets the flu,
black people get pneumonia.'
It's well-known in our circles that we have worse outcomes
when it comes to a lot of these different diseases,
you know, and part of that is systemic racism.
A lot of it is access to healthcare.
If you have the money, you can get the best healthcare
in the world,but without those resources,
you have inadequate care and sporadic care.
So any kind of disease spread then falls hardest
on communities that are already at a health risk.
What are we dealing with?
With this coronavirus,COVID-19?
We're dealing with clearly an emerging infectious disease
that has now reached outbreak proportions
and likely pandemic proportions.
The 'Grand Princess'Cruise Ship has been moored
off the coast of California.
I want to commend the efforts of our Coast Guard
that heroically flew coronavirus tests
to the ship.
21 tested positive for the coronavirus.
On his way to a weekend trip
to Mar-a-Lago,Trump made a stop at the CDC.
Watching the president go
to the Centers for Disease Control,
he discussed with a reporter
the fact that one of the cruise ships was still offshore.
I'd rather have them stay on
because I like the numbers being where they are.
I don't need to have the numbers double
because of one ship.
For the first time,it occurred to me
that the government of the United States
was intentionally slow walking testing.
In this big vast land of ours,
this great country of ours,we have 240 cases.
Most of those people are gonna be fine.
The vast majority are going to be fine.
We've had 11 deaths.
All of our state labs
now have the ability to test for this virus...
And they have had.
The testing has been amazing, actually,
what they've been able to produce
in such a short period of time.
Anybody that wants a test can get a test.
Anybody who wanted a test knew that was a lie.
Just finding a facility was hard.
People with the disease were denied tests
on account of supply backlogs,
which also caused delays in results.
The next day,while Trump golfed,
Pence and Redfield went to Cruise Lines of America.
We all recognize the recent challenges
on the 'Diamond Princess,'
and the ongoing challenge with the 'Grand Princess,'
and we want to ensure that the American people
can continue as we dealwith the coronavirus
to enjoy the opportunities in the cruise line industry
and be confident.
I would not encourage anyone
to change their plans at this point
based on what the epidemiology is here in Florida.
They should enjoy Disneyland.
They should enjoy the rest of Florida.
There is this back and forth,
the medical folks saying we need to take this seriously,
we need to be aggressive,
the economic folks pushing back and saying, 'Yeah, but...'
Fauci would march upand answer questions.
Do you believe that people,
even if they're healthy, should get onboard a cruise ship?
I would recommend strongly
that they do not go on a cruise ship.
And then Trump or Pence would come back
and sort of contradict him.
We're gonna work with the cruise line industry
to improve the safety,
improve the health environmenton cruise lines.
Frankly, the testing has been going very smooth.
If you go to the right agency,
if you go to the right area,you get the test.
Will you admit that there is a serious problem
in this country
obtaining access to testing for coronavirus?
My colleague is looking at me to answer that.
- Here we go.- Okay.
The system is not really geared
to what we need right now.
- That is a failing.- A failing, yes.
It is a failing.Let's admit it.
Dr. Fauci said earlier this week
that the lag in testing was, in fact, a failing.
Do you take responsibility for that?
Yeah, no, I don't takeresponsibility at all.
We're doing a great job.
Yeah, we have 40 people right now... 40.
Compare that with other countries
that have many, many times that amount.
To keep new cases from entering our shores,
we will be suspending all travel from Europe
to the United States for the next 30 days.
There was a problem
with Trump's sudden travel ban...
it had no plan attached.
If we do get back to the U.S., then what happens?
Do we go into quarantine?Do we go home?
Returning Americans flooded U.S. airports,
where they were jammed inmake shift COVID checkpoints.
They were perfect conditions for more contagion,
as travelers from Europe spread the virus into the U.S.
The message to New Yorkers from the beginning has been,
'This is somethingwe all can handle together.
Go about your lives.Go about your business.'
The Governor confirming
that coronavirus has arrived here in Manhattan.
The coronavirus spreads tonight as Governor Cuomo
announces five more positive cases in New York.
The number of confirmed cases has reached 121.
Today, Governor Cuomo announcing a ban
on any gatherings of 500 people or more.
And 613 confirmed cases of coronavirus in New York.
That is more than any other state.
I'm glad to see that you're practicing social distancing.
That looks very nice.
We're announcing new guidelines for every American to follow.
Avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people,
and avoid eating and drinkingin bars, restaurants.
And if everybody in America does what we ask for,
we will see a dramatic difference,
and we won't have to worry about the ventilators,
and we won't have to worry about the ICU beds.
Our volume is just exploding.
We have so many people in the hallways.
A day or so ago, we put 14 people on ventilators.
Mayor de Blasio says that there have been 100 new cases
in the city today alone.
So we're going to put out an executive order today.
New York State on pause.
19 million New Yorkers are being asked to stay at home
as much as possible.
Now topping 85,000 confirmed cases
and more than 1,400 deaths.
I hate to say this,but it's true...
we are now the epicenter of this crisis
right here in the nation's largest city.
And if this goes on for a month, or two, or three,
or five like it did in China,we don't have what we need.
This is not a country that was built to be shut down.
We're not gonna let the cure be worse than the problem.
Worried about the economy,
Trump tried to limit shutdowns,
but the virus was out of control.
By April, over 3,000 New Yorkers had died,
surpassing the death toll of 9/11.
ICUs were over capacity with patients who couldn't breathe.
Ventilators were in short supply,
and many of those who got them did not survive.
We had seen the pandemic
was really taking off in New York City.
We were in a central area of Virginia
where there's not a huge population,
and it was like being on a coastal city
and you hear about an earthquake
that happens off shore.
You know that a tsunami is coming.
You just don't know when it's gonna happen
and how severe it's gonna be.
A U.S. Marine in Virginia
has tested positive for the coronavirus.
This is the first positive case in Virginia,
and here's what we know.
I remember one day, I was rounding in our COVID ICU,
and our unit is structured kind of like a V,
so there's one wing here,another wing over there.
And you know, these are some of the sickest patients
I've ever taken care of in my life.
They're on breathing machines,dialysis machines.
They are needing lots of medicines
to keep them sedated and calm.
And I'm trying to get through morning rounds,
and I see that on one wing,
it's almost all Hispanic last names.
And then, on the other wing,
it's almost all Black names.
I grew up an hour away from where I'm working.
These are the family names that I grew up with,
and I know these families.
And I just was trying to focus on the medical part
and just getting through it,
but I just felt this weight on my chest.
I'm a Black male in the United States
and my family members have chronic diseases
at high rates,
and I've been dealing with this my whole life.
And now I have family members who are contracting COVID.
Those are smiles and hugs and tears and barbeques.
They're not numbers on a paper.
Through the spring,
the death toll would rise to 100,000.
It was a terrifying marker
for the failure of the American response.
The U.S. was 4%of the world's population
and 20% of the deaths from the virus.
Despite the fatal consequences of inaction,
the government could not solve basic problems
like supplies for test kits.
In March, we started to see the global supply chain
really get jammed up.
So it was extraction kits,swabs.
The major producer of swabs
is in the Lombardy region of Italy.
And Italy had just gone on lockdown,
and the swabs company was in a no-fly zone,
so the U.S. supply is basically going...
grinding to a halt.
Every single step of the way,we've encountered an issue
or a problem with the supply chain.
Potential supply chain problems
had been identified in 'Crimson Contagion.'
The focus was on testing supplies and lifesaving PPE.
The most critical items needed were N95 masks,
whose firm fit and tight me shoffered healthcare workers
real protection from the disease.
We had estimated the number of N95 respirators
that would be needed.
That number was 3 1/2 billion.
And we had a fraction
of what we would need in the stockpile.
And all of those had a five-year shelf life,
and a lot of those,
they were purchased almost ten years ago.
Despite Ebola,despite Zika, despite H1N1,
filling up the national stockpile for some virus
that we don't even know is ever gonna come
has never been the top priority.
You can say the Obama Administration didn't do enough
to leave the next administration prepared.
You can also say,'Well, that's true,
but the Trump Administration had three and a half years.'
The Strategic National Stockpile was not intended
to be everything that we would need for an entire crisis.
I think in mid-January,the U.S. government
should have been looking at the stockpile
to see what was in it
and how we were gonna pivot to manufacture more.
We should have been having the conversation
about the Defense Production Act in January.
There's talk of invoking war powers
to require U.S. companies to manufacture some goods.
That's right,
so that's called the Defense Production Act.
I believe it came into existence
during the Korean War.
Effectively, we can determine
that our production should get to the front of the line.
We'll use it if we need to,but we obviously...
if we can work cooperatively with any vendor,
we'd rather do that.
'Let the market work its magic.'
That was the guiding philosophy for Azar and Trump,
but their anti-government strategy
ignored basic rules of supply and demand.
Without a large order from the United States government,
there really wasn't an incentive for these companies
to start maximizing their throughput.
I was getting reports from Mike Bowen, one of the few
remaining producers of face masks and respirators
in the United States
who had his finger on the pulse of the supply chain.
I'm a salesman telling a story that nobody believes.
The story is that the U.S.mask supply is gonna collapse
and people are gonna die.
It doesn't cost much to fix.
That's the story.
Around 2005, all of the major mask makers left the country.
It put the U.S. mask supply
in the hands of foreign control
and could be subject todiversion during a pandemic.
And that's what I've been warning about for years.
I wrote Barack Obama 20 letters.
'Tell America's hospitals that they are going to be
'in a position to not be able to protect their staff
and their patients.'
I voted for Donald Trump.
I thought, 'You know,if I contact enough people
'in the administration,somebody, one of these people
'are gonna look at this and go,'Hey, this is a problem.
Maybe we ought to call this guy.''
And no, I couldn't get any...
I didn't get any response there.
In January,Bowen's predictions came true.
As China struggled to contain the outbreak of COVID,
it limited the export of N95 masks to the United States.
At the end of January,
I'm hearing from all over the world.
People are freaking out about masks, and needing masks.
And that's when I got ahold of Rick and said,
'Hey, here's what I'm seeing out here.
This is gonna be bad.'
He was sounding the alarm bells almost every day.
We can't protect America's population.
That's too late, but I said I can at least make
enough masks to protect America's healthcare workers.
I reminded him that we had these four respirator lines.
To activate them we would need more people, raw materials,
emergency NIOSH approval, and large non-cancellable orders.
I see that our country's gonna have a problem,
I get a hold of Rick.
I pushed every one of those emails
up to the Strategic National Stockpile
and Critical Infrastructure Team.
I reminded them of the H5N1 scare,
when people rushed to buy masks and hoard masks.
The response I got was,
'We will just change the CDC guideline.
And we'll just tell people,don't do that.'
Basically in March,they realized
that the healthcare workers
are not going to have enough PPE,
so they basically issued a warning to the public,
'Do not use face masks.'
Do you have any sense of how many more N95 masks
would be on the market had the federal government taken you up
on your offer to reactivate N95 manufacturing lines
in January?
About 7 million N95 respirators per month.
I sounded the alarm every day
about the shortage of N95 respirators,
and we were doing nothing.
The numbers continue to surge in hotspots
like California, Michigan,Louisiana, Florida,
and especially,of course, New York.
Medical resources are stretched to capacity
and beyond.
We had saved some outdated N95 masks
that were part of the Ebola response,
but quickly we ran out of those supplies,
so we had to make do.
Some of the N95 masks that we received
had been in storage for years and years,
and while the actual mask itself worked fine,
the rubber band was brittle.
So there were people in the room
taking care of a patient,and the mask just snaps off.
The CDC is now advising healthcare workers
to ration masks,to use expired masks,
even use bandanas or scarvesas a last resort.
Our usage increased by several hundredfold.
We could see our equipment supply going down dramatically.
So you kind of clamp down alittle bit and say, you know,
'We're gonna save it for the severy specific encounters.'
So now, from the perspectiveof a healthcare worker,
you're taking away my safety.
And what people really wanted was a big enough supply
so that anyone who felt that they were at a higher risk
could be safe.
One mask to be worn for 12 hours.
It's just ridiculous.
No protective equipment,the gowns.
We have to improvise with what we have.
We have people coming in sewing masks, sewing shields,
making things out of plastics.
This is what we're doing now?
I mean that would be like a soldier going to war
and making a plastic gun to bring with him.
This is what's happening.
- PPEs!- Every day!
PPEs!
Every day!
We're here in the community fighting every day,
and we need some help.
In February, theTrump Administration actually
created the China-COVID Procurement Service
to encourage American producers like 3M
to sell their entire inventories of N95 masks
to China.
When American hospitals desperately needed N95s,
they were forced to import them
and pay up to 10 times more
than the price charged by American producers.
PPE has been sporadic,but we do what we have to do.
We're nurses,and we learn to adapt
and to get the job done and get the care provided,
and that's what we're gonna continue to do.
Sporadic for you,
but not sporadic for a lot of other people.
Oh, no, I agree,Mr. President.
Because I've heard the opposite.
I've heard that they are loaded up with gowns now.
And you know, initially,we had nothing.
We had empty cupboards.We had empty shelves.
We had nothing because it wasn't put there
by the last administration.
In the midst of the crisis,
President Trump goes on TV and says, 'Don't worry.
We've got plenty of PPE for healthcare workers.'
What was your reaction when you saw that?
I know what my reaction was.
I turned to my wife and said,'That's complete bullshit.
He has no idea what he's talking about.'
I'm getting 500 to 1,000 emails a day.
I'm getting emails from people,not businesses.
I'm getting emails from moms.
I'm getting emails from oldpeople, 'Please send me masks.'
And I can't.
You make a product that can protect people.
I can't help all these people.
The PPE shortage continued on for months,
even after Trump put one of his most trusted
family members in charge
of procuring protective equipment.
Jared Kushner formed his own task force
to get supplies.
Was that confusing?Like did you...
It was extremely confusing.
The president wanted to make sure
that we had the best people doing the best jobs
and making sure that we had the right people focused
on all the things that needed to happen
to make sure that we can deliver in these unusual times
for the American people.
My old boss called me and said he heard that
Jared Kushner's task force needed younger volunteers
who had general skills and were willing
to work seven days a week for no money,
and if you fit those criteria,that you should head to D.C.
and help with the pandemic response.
I definitely had some apprehension
about working for the administration,
but it felt like the country
and the world were under attack.
It seemed like if there was something to do to help,
that was the right thing to do.
They basically gave us a day
to show up in D.C.at the FEMA Headquarters.
We walked into Conference Room A,
which was this windowless,subterranean conference room.
There were televisions all around the walls
all playing FOX News.
One representative from FEMA
and one representative from the military
gave a quick pep talk.
They kept saying 'the stuff,'and by that they meant PPE.
And they kept saying, 'There's stuff all around the world.
'There's stuff in the U.S.,and we need
to get it to hospitalsas fast as possible.'
Everyone stood up and started filing into different offices,
and I remember the only people left were the volunteers.
We thought we would beauxiliary support
for an existing procurement team that just needed
to be expanded as quickly as possible
and we would, you know,do data entry for contracts.
And instead, we were the team.
I think when people imagined the federal government response
in the war room, they thought it would be this big,
you know, energized group of experts,
not ten 20-year-old volunteers all just with private laptops.
No industry relationships,
no experience working in supply chain.
So we started cold-emailing people we knew
who had business relationships in China,
looking for factories online,
and emailing them from our personal Gmail accounts.
Because we had never done this before,
you know, there were all these really basic questions
about how a federal procurementoperation should work.
We would call factories and say,
'We think the federal government can send you a check
in 60 days,'and they would say,
'There's someone with a briefcase of cash,
and they are offering to pay me right now.'
And we would run around the FEMA building
looking for someone who could tell us what payment terms
the federal government was allowed to offer,
and no one ever told us.
One week into our work,several government employees
walked into the room and handed out NDAs
and told us we had to sign the NDAs
or leave the room immediately,
and we all had built our own relationships
with manufacturers, and it felt like if we walked away,
it would negatively affect our ability
to buy this critical,lifesaving equipment.
And so we all begrudgingly signed the NDA.
In the room,there were those TVs
all around the walls playing the news.
They always had a death counter.
And so every hour we were sitting there,
trying to buy PPE that we all knew could save lives,
and we were watching thenumber of deaths in the U.S.
tick higher and higher and higher.
And that weighed on all of us.
The president also instructed me to make sure
that I break down every barrier needed
to make sure that the teams can succeed.
The first time Jared Kushner came into the room,
he had this big entourage,and he said,
'I want to make this as effective as possible.
'Tell me the problems that you have,
and I will solve them today.'
And we said, 'We need to be able to pay upfront.'
And he said, 'Done,'
but there was no action taken that we saw whatsoever.
In the entire time that I was a volunteer,
our team did not directly purchase a single mask.
Kushner failed to protect doctors and nurses,
but he was willing to trade government help
for political benefits.
When the Democratic Governorof California, Gavin Newsom,
desperately needed testing swabs,
Kushner said Trump would grant the request
on two conditions:
Newsom would have to get on the phone
and ask Trump personally
and then thank him publicly.
I want to thank the president,
not only for being available for a phone call
at a moment's notice,but being willing
to directly commit to all of us in the state of California.
Built around personal relationships,
Kushner's task force was run by his college roommate
and Ivanka Trump's former assistant.
Rather than rely on experienced public officials,
the task force prioritized private tips in a spreadsheet
called 'VIP Update,'
which included two Republican dentists
and a FOX News personality.
The whole philosophy of the task force
was that the government can't get things done
and they thought the private market
could largely settle this issue,
but it was only once they had tried and failed
that they'd started to blame other people and say,
'Actually, this was your job the whole time.'
You have instances where in cities, they're running out,
but the state still has a stockpile.
And the notion of the federal stockpile
was it's supposed to be our stockpile.
It's not supposed to be states' stockpiles
that they then use.
My understanding is the only reason
the federal stockpile exists is to distribute it to states.
The people in charge on the task force said,
you know,talking about the president...
love him or hate him,he's a marketing genius.
He came up with the strategy to blame the states,
because the federal government
hasn't been able to do this effectively.
Federal government has assets and abilities
that no state can possibly mobilize.
They have a global supply chain.
They have a logistic capability
through the Department of Defense
and Department of Homel and Security
to get stuff in and distribute it
to places all over the country.
President Trump flipped that on its head.
Then there became this madrush for each and every state
to try and find equipment on their own.
Breaker one nine,this here's Rubber Duck.
Mercy sakes alive,
looks like we've got us a convoy.
We continued to source and ship as much PPE as we can
by whatever means necessary.
Arizona, noon,on the seventh of June
When they highballed over the pass
We had the governor of Massachusetts using a plane
from the New England Patriots to bring equipment from China.
'Cause we got a little ol' convoy
The equipment is now in the hands of the National Guard,
who will deliver it to an undisclosed location.
Convoy
Whoo-hoo!
We had the governor of Maryland
using contacts of his wife's
to bring equipment infrom South Korea.
He felt it important enough to guard that equipment
when it landed in Maryland,because he didn't want it
confiscated by the federal government.
We're competing against every other state,
every other country.
Now we're even competing against the federal government.
It's like being on eBay with 50 other states,
bidding on a ventilator.
You see the bid go up 'cause California bid.
Illinois bid, Florida bid,New York bids,
California rebids.
And then FEMA starts bidding.
So FEMA is driving up the price.
What?
I stand here as someone who has had confirmed orders
for millions of pieces of gear evaporate in front of us,
and I can't tell you how frustrating it is.
I get a feeling if there's somebody had the chance to
sell to you or had the chanceto sell to me,
I'm gonna lose every one of those.
All right, Charlie.Thank you very much.
Well, we do like you going out seeing what you can get,
if you can get it faster,
and the price is always a component to that also,
and maybe that's why you lost to the feds.
I'll tell you,that's probably why, but...
If the goal was to get PPE to the states,
why would the federal government
be driving up the price to outbid them?
Or was driving up the price the whole point?
This morning,our first project
that we called Airbridge...
that's Airbridge,that's the name.
And it was a flight that landed in JFK
and contained nearly 2 million masks.
This is the first of 50 flights,
and that will probably increase substantially.
Project Airbridge was a plan to subsidize
the efforts of private companies to buy and sell PPE.
Max Kennedy's team would find the PPE
and negotiate the lowest possible price.
Private companies would then pay the bill.
Then the federal government would pay
to fly the PPE stateside from overseas.
And we had partnered
with the five largest medical distributors.
Once we shipped it to the United States,
they would take over and sell directly
to whoever they would like,at whatever price they wanted.
Just to clarify,that explains why states say
they're bidding like they're on eBay,
because the supplies are going to the private sector,
and then they have to go there to get the supplies.
That's normally how things work, right?
So I'm not here to disrupt,
uh, a supply chain.
The U.S. government was handing a huge amount
of business to these five companies
that were chosen fairly arbitrarily.
There were increasing concerns,I think, from competitors,
that these five companies were getting
a hugely unfair advantage,
and so I was asked on several different occasions explicitly
to find a justification to have selected these companies way...
you know, months after they had been selected.
At least one of these companies, Cardinal,
saw its PPE orders surge to 12 times the normal volume.
Profit-making was also part of
the pandemic pricing plan at Gilead,
which manufactured the one drug, Remdesivir,
that was effective at treating COVID.
The federal government owned patents on the drug,
and it paid for essential research.
But the Trump administration permitted Gilead
to charge more than $3,000 a patient
for a treatment that costless than $10 to manufacture.
I left in mid-April,and my takeaway
was really that I still feel like
I haven't worked for the government.
We were so far outside of it.I mean, we were...
every single person we reported to
up the chain of commandwas a political appointee.
The number of FEMA employees I met, you know,
I could count on one hand,
and they were fleeting interactions.
It taught me about how this administration works,
and I think it largely works,or it seemed to work,
in this case,outside of the government.
In the course of three years,
there was a systematic dismantling
of what expertise had been built
and what framework had been built
to respond to the very kind of global pandemic
that we're dealing with.
It's preventing the people who were there
from doing the jobs that they'd been hired to do.
Tell me a little bit about how chloroquine
and hydroxychloroquine first came into your point of view.
You know...
How did this come up?
I wish I'd never heard of chloroquine
or hydroxy chloroquine,honestly.
Elon Musk started the ball rolling with a tweet.
Momentum for the drugs picked up steam
over the next few day son FOX News,
where their names were dropped 176 times.
Early evidence suggests thatchloroquine...
- Chloroquine.- Hydroxychloroquine.
Those look very promising.
Then Trump started reading from the FOX script.
It is known as a malaria drug,
and it's been around for a long time.
And it's shown very encouraging...
very, very encouraging...early results.
I believe it was March 23rd.
I got a call from Secretary Azar's chief counsel.
The White House wanted us to move quickly
on making this drug available.
At my direction, the federal government is working to help
obtain large quantities of chloroquine.
I called my scientific team in BARDA,
and they said, 'No way.'
There was no data to support that they had any benefit
against the coronavirus.
They pushed back,but Dr. Kadlec reiterated
that directive to us and said,'Get on it, get it done.'
We came up with option of anemergency use authorization.
We could put boundaries in it,
restrict the drug to only be used
in people who are hospitalized.
And I was proud of our team
for coming up with that compromise
that we thought would protect the Americans.
Have you ever heard of a Dr. Zelenko?
Yes.
He is a very mysterious presence that seemed to be
involved in the context of this chloroquine story.
- Hi.- Hi.
Dr. Vladimir Zelenko became a right-wing folk hero
and the Trump team promoted him as an essential expert
on the use of hydroxychloroquine
as a magical remedy for COVID.
For the last almost 16 years,
I've been a primary care doctor for a community
of around 35,000 people.
It's a village in the town of Monroe.
It's similar to an urban environment
in terms of how close people live with each other.
So it's not surprising that
the virus came and started spreading.
And I realized that, my God,I have an inferno.
I have a real outbreak.
I know all these people,they're like family to me.
So it was personal.
The whole world was focusing on
building more respirators,more hospitals,
and there was nothing being offered
to primary care doctors.
You know,we're front-line soldiers
with no bullets, no weapons.
So then you have to improvise.
Dr. Zelenko improvised
what he thoughtwas a magic bullet
that contained his own unproven mash-up
of zinc, azithromycin,and hydroxychloroquine.
But there was no reputable clinical trial
that confirmed Zelenko's claims
that early use of his cocktail could cure COVID.
I wasn't doing research.I was just treating patients.
But I'm not stupid.
I saw exactly what was happening.
Patients stopped dying.
I just found potentially
one of the most important pieces of information
in the history of information.
I'm not a politician.I don't have any connections.
So how else does a person who's unconnected
reach the highest levelsof government?
It's called social media.
Um, hello, President Trump.
My name is Dr. Vladimir Zelenko.
So I made a YouTube video
addressed to the president of the United States,
and the next day, his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, calls me.
We had a conversation,and that started a process
that eventually led me to
the FDA commissioner,Stephen Hahn.
It's not every day you get
the commissioner of the FDA calling you on your cell phone.
According to the FDA...
There was not a scientific reason
to push either one of those drugs.
The reason they were pushing them so hard was because
the president was claiming that they were a miracle drug.
Someone had given him this advice.
I happen to be taking it.I happen to be taking it.
I'm taking it.Hydroxychloroquine.
Right now, yeah.
Did you hear what he said afterwards?
'Yeah, I received a letter...'
From a doctor the other day,
from Westchester, New York,around the area.
He didn't want anything.He just said,
'Sir, I have hundreds of patients,
and I give them hydroxychloroquine.'
So that was a letter
I sent to the president.
But I thought it was a very well-crafted letter
by a man who's a respected doctor.
He said it was a well-crafted letter.
I was proud of that.
It was really frustrating,
because here we are on the front lines,
we're trying to do everything we can,
and if, you know, there's a chance that this could work,
let's go ahead and try it.
But then, consistently,
the trials that had been high quality looking at this
have shown that there's no benefit to it.
And we have moved onto other therapies.
But unfortunately, you know,it can come back and be revived
by a tweet from a leader who still believes in it.
The next day, if you admit
a patient with COVID-19,some of them are gonna ask,
'Are you gonna give me the Trump drug?'
And if you go through a long explanation of, you know,
'Actually,there's no benefit,'
it's really hard to explain this.
And it would be so much more helpful
if the leader of the country,who sets the example, said,
'We should followthe science on this.'
I've seen things that I sort of like,
so what do I know?I'm not a doctor.
It was about six days after that EUA.
I woke up to an email string
that had our Assistant Secretary for Health,
our Director of FEMA,our ASPR, Dr. Kadlec,
and the FDA all saying we need to flood the streets
of New York and New Jersey
with that drug as quickly as possible.
And in that email discussion,someone was brave enough...
they said, 'But wait a minute.
The EUA says 'for hospitalized patients only.''
They said, 'No, it needs to go into the pharmacies.
'It needs to go out everywhere.
'The EUA doesn't matter.
Push the drug out now.'
The same FDA that dragged its feet for weeks
at approving vital COVID tests
suddenly worked at lightning speed to greenlight use
of a drug with no proven effect on the disease,
just because the White House wanted it done.
If this drug works,
it will be wonderful,it'll be so beautiful.
It'll be a gift from heaven.
I lost it.
I lost all respect for that chain of command,
for that security
that we as Americans have put in those people.
And that is the moment that I decided to break protocol
and alert Americans in a different way.
In the doctrine of politics,
Rick Bright committed a mortal sin.
He went to the press.
It was two weeks exactly after that
that I learned that I had been removed from my position.
It's not easy to come forwardin this administration, okay?
I'm not trying to be soft in here, but it is not easy.
It was a very hard process
to lay our careers on the line to push back.
Time is running out because
the virus is still spreading everywhere.
The window is closing to address this pandemic.
So, you know, Dr. Brightis up there testifying today.
And on hydroxychloroquine,Dr. Bright literally signed
in the application for FDA authorization of it.
We will either be remembered for what we did
or for what we failed to do to address this crisis.
I watched this guy for a little while this morning,
and he looks like an angry, disgruntled employee
who, frankly, according to some people,
didn't do a very good job.
Would you describe the government's response
as a success or a failure?
I believe we could have done better.
Watching the administration's response
to Bright was frightening.
We all wanted to help,but we didn't wanna be
on the front page of a newspaper.
I spoke to a couple of attorneys
who said it's so unusual for the government
to require an NDA at all, let alone for volunteers
who don't have any access to government systems.
We had no access to any confidential information.
The only thing we were basically being prevented
from talking about was the fact that the response was...
seemed to be largely bungled.
To date, we've facilitated the supply
of more than 38 million N95 masks nationwide.
And I would watch the news ,and I'd hear
the Trump administration talk about the work
that was happening, and what was happening did not
match what the administration was speaking about.
So I did send in
a whistleblower report to Congress,
as well as calling several journalists
who I basically just found online.
It was nerve-racking.
I was worried about the NDA,
I was worried about potential retribution.
But I just wanted people to know what was happening,
and know not enough was being done.
Beyond attacking whistleblowers,
Trump dismissed five inspectors general
in the space of six weeks.
One had raised concerns about PPE shortages.
Another was supposed to investigate
how the Trump administration would spend
$2.3 trillion in coronavirus relief.
While money did flow to unemployed Americans,
a small group of hedge fund investors
and real estate tycoons,
like Jared Kushner and Donald Trump,
got millions of dollars in tax breaks.
Trump protected the richest Americans,
even as he continued to ignore the most basic recommendations
of scientists trying to protect everyday people.
The CDC is recommending that
Americans wear a basic clothor fabric mask.
They can be either purchased online or simply made at home,
probably material that you'd have at home.
Really a voluntary thing.You can do it.
You don't have to do it. I'm choosing not to do it.
But some people may wanna do it, and that's okay.
I made a lot of predictions that came true
about this pandemic, but masks being politicized...
it's just amazing to me.
Live and let die
The deadly implications
of the president's disdain for science
weren't lost on whoever picked the soundtrack
for Trump's tour of a mask factory in Arizona.
Live and let die
It was confusing campaign photo op:
federal officials refusing to wear safety masks
in a sanitized factory that manufactured them.
The mask seems to represent
which side of the politicalaisle that you're on,
and somehow, showing up without a mask on
in close proximity with others
says that I support the president.
You're fuckingdemocratic pigs!
I'll take that fucking mask off your face!
No more masks!
No more masks!
That is dangerous.
People have died because of the misinformation.
I have absolutely no doubt about that.
In April, afterweeks of economic shutdown
and with contagion and death
still running high in much of America,
Trump announced the plan for reopening the country.
Our team of experts now agrees
that we can begin the next front in our war,
which we're calling Opening Up America Again,
and that's what we're doing.
We're opening up our country.
The next day,he began to tweet
in encouragement of protests against lockdowns
meant to contain spread of the virus.
Frustration's understandable.
People wanted to get out of their homes
to get back to work.
USA!
But without a national program
to safe guard public health,
how is the economy going to get back on its feet?
So I said to my people,
'Slow the testing down,please.'
Texas, hitting a record number of hospitalizations.
Florida recording anastonishing 11,400 cases,
smashing its single day high.
Opening up the country without
a national program for masks,testing, and tracing
did have consequences.
Through out the summer,
the death tollh overed around 1,000 a day,
or two 9/11s every week.
In South Korea,a nation of 51 million,
there was no national shutdown,
and less than 500 people died from the disease.
For a lot of people around me in South Korea,
perceptions of the U.S.have really been shaken.
South Koreans, like a lot of other people around the world,
had a certain perception of the U.S.
as a barometer and a benchmark for how a country works,
how a country should run.
There is a real sense of disbelief.
Thousands descended on beaches
in Greece over the weekend,while in Italy,
more shops and restaurants are again welcoming customers.
The crowds are returning
to the stadiums here in New Zealand.
As many countries opened up,
others faced new outbreaks.
Some, like Brazil and India,saw cases continue to soar.
But even in countries like South Korea,
where the virus was initially contained,
cases spiked when people ignored scientific guidance.
Nowhere was that problem more severe
than in the United States.
America, America
Ignoring expert advice became an act
of patriotism in the Trump administration,
Where even the push for a safe vaccine
was pursued with reckless disregard for science.
We're moving aggressively
to accelerate developing a vaccine.
To actually get a vaccine that you know works
is gonna be a year to a year and a half.
Do me a favor.Speed it up.
Speed it up.
Stakes are so high around vaccines.
Because we need a vaccine
if we want to begin to end this pandemic.
But the question is,who distributes it?
Who prioritizes it?
A lot of people say this should be the CDC.
'They should be front and center in this.'
But the CDC has been largely silenced.
After a few CDC scientists
voiced concerns about the federal response,
Trump installed an official to censor or rewrite
any CDC findings that contradicted
the rosy predictions of the White House.
Can we trust scientists who allow data to be compromised
by demands for political loyalty?
My last question to you is,
what is your personal takeaway from this pandemic?
Um...
53,000 deaths from coronavirus.
Sometimes late at night when I'm driving home
and I'm tired of listening to talk radio on NPR,
I'll turn on the other NPR station and listen to jazz.
I've never listened to jazz in my life.
I've always been very thankful for the people around me,
and I think that's come with age, partly.
And now that we're allwearing masks all the time,
there is an astounding amount of information
that you can get out oflooking at people's eyes.
Which, when the rest of your face is completely obscured,
become extremely telling of what's going on,
whether your eyes are happy or sad or smiling.
This is going to be the 1918 influenza epidemic story,
and it will be written about for the next 100 years.
And I think that realization should really drive
a lot of our behavior and our choices.
There's so much that the virus has exposed,
the lessons are just gonna be ongoing over time.
And the degree of sufferingis just so immense
that it's hard toreally conceptualize it.
And it's gonna take a long time for us
to really figure out the consequences of this,
because there are consequences
for the people who survive this.
We spend billions of dollars every year
on missiles that, hopefully,will never fly,
on weapons that, hopefully,we will never use.
We have to take health security
as seriously as we do defense security.
I think the career staff and scientists were in place.
They were battle-tested.
They knew their role,they knew the plan,
and they were prepared to act.
They put on their uniformto respond to this pandemic,
and then there was nowhere to go.
There is a misconception that public health failed.
The truth is that political leaders
failed to follow public health guidance,
and that's what caused avoidable disease, death,
and economic destruction.
Politicians are the problem.
We've gotta believe in the scientists.
And we've got politicians who don't believe in science.
America is lagging behind
every other country, almost,in their response, and I...
hey, you gotta blame the manager.
If we're to blame the manager,
we must be able to answer
an essential political question:
What did the president know,and when did he know it?
Eight months after the pandemic began,
we got the answer.
On February 7th,two weeks before
anyone in Americahad died from the disease,
journalist Bob Woodward asked Donald Trump
if he knew how contagious and dangerous COVID might be.
It goes through air, Bob.
That's always tougher than the touch, you know?
The touch, you don't have to touch things, right?
But the air, you just breathe the air,
and that's how it's passed.
It's also more deadly than your...
even your strenuous flus,you know?
So this is deadly stuff.
Our manager failed us.
But the disease also revealed
more fundamental problems with our government.
We will see more pandemics and other existential threats.
All on account of manmade problems,
we must prepare to solve together.
Our ability to reckon with the future
will depend on how much we learn from our recent past.
When the day comes when we canfinally take off our masks,
will we be ready to fix what's really broken?
Time has come today
Young hearts can go their way
Can't put it off another day
I don't care what others say
They think we don't listen anyway
Time has come today
Hey!
Oh!
The rules have changed today
I have no place to stay
I'm thinking about the subway
My love has flown away
My tears have come and gone
Oh my Lord,I have to roam
I have no home
I have no home
Now the time has come
There's no place to run
I might get burned up by the sun
But I had my fun
I've been loved and put aside
I've been crushed by the tumbling tide
And my soul
Oh
A newlywed couple just moved to town
A regular husband and wife
Who left the big city To find a quiet life
WandaVision!
She's a magical gal In a small town locale
He's a hubby who's part machine
How will this duo fit in and fulfill all?
By sharing a love like you've never seen
WandaVision!
My wife and her flying saucers.
My husband and his indestructible head.
-Aren't we a fine pair? -
What do you say to silver dollar pancakes, crispy hash browns, bacon, eggs,
freshly squeezed orange juice, and black coffee?
I say, "Oh, I don't eat food."
Well, that explains the empty refrigerator.
-Wanda? -WANDA: Hmm?
Is there something special about today?
Well, I know the apron is a bit much, dear,
but I am doing my best to blend in.
No, no, there on the calendar.
Someone's drawn a little heart right above today's date.
-Oh, yes, the heart. -Hmm...
Well, don't tell me you have forgotten, Vis.
"Forgotten"?
Oh, Wanda, I'm incapable of forgetfulness. I remember everything.
That's not an exaggeration. In fact, I'm incapable of exaggeration.
Well, then tell me what's so important about today's date.
What was the question again?
Oh, well, perhaps, you've forgotten yourself.
Me? Heavens, no. I've been so looking forward to it.
As have I.
Today, we are celebrating...
You bet we are.
-It's the first time we... -Mmm-hmm.
...have ever celebrated this occasion before.
It's a special day!
-Perhaps an evening... -Of great significance...
-To us both! -Naturally.
-Obviously. -Exactly.
Well done, us.
All right.
Well, that's me off to work, then.
Oh, don't forget!
I haven't.
Have a good day, dear!
Hello, dear. I'm Agnes, your neighbor to the right.
My right, not yours.
Forgive me for not stopping by sooner to welcome you to the block.
My mother-in-law was in town, so I wasn't.
So, what's your name? Where are you from?
And most importantly, how's your bridge game, hon?
I'm Wanda.
Wanda. Charmed.
Golly, you settled in fast!
Did you use a moving company?
I sure did. Those boxes don't move themselves.
So what's a single gal like you doing rattling around this big house?
Oh, no, I'm not single.
Oh, I don't see a ring.
Well, I assure you I'm married.
To a man. A human one and tall.
As a matter of fact, he'll be home later tonight for a special occasion.
Just the two of us.
Oh, is it somebody's birthday?
Not a birthday.
Well, today isn't a holiday, is it?
No, it's not a holiday.
An anniversary then?
Ye... Yes!
Yes! It's our anniversary!
Oh, how marvelous!
How many years?
Well, it feels like we've always been together.
Lucky gal.
The only way Ralph would remember our anniversary
is if there was a beer named June 2nd.
-So, what do you have planned? -How do you mean?
For your special night.
A young thing like you doesn't have to do much,
but it's still fun to set the scene.
Say, I was just reading a crackerjack magazine article
called "How To Treat Your Husband To Keep Your Husband,"
and let me tell you, what Ralph could really use
is, "How To Goose Your Wife So You Don't Lose Your Wife."
Hang on. I'll go grab it and we can start planning.
Oh, this is gonna be a gas!
Or you don't go out Friday night Yakety yak!
You just put on your coat and hat
Here are those computational forms that you requested, Norm.
There you go.
Gee willikers, that was fast!
Hey, the music isn't bothering you, is it, pal?
In terms of distraction from work,
or the largely nonsensical nature of the lyrics?
-The first one. -Ah, no, thank you, Norm.
Hey, is there somethin' I can help you with, buddy?
Yes, as a matter of fact, there is.
Would you be so good as to tell me what it is we do here exactly?
Do we make something?
-No. -Right.
Do we buy or sell something?
No and no.
Then what is the purpose of this company?
All I know is, since you've gotten here, productivity has gone up 300%.
Yes, but what is it we're producing?
Computational forms.
And no one can process the data quite like you do, pal.
You're like a walking computer.
What? I most certainly am not.
I'm a regular carbon-based employee made entirely of organic matter,
much like yourself, Norm.
Hey! What's got your feathers all ruffled?
Yes, I'm sorry, I'm a tad on edge.
You see, it appears there's something special about today,
special to Wanda, that's my wife,
and gee, I can't, for the life of me, recall what it is.
Good to see you.
-Vision. -Yes?
Wife and I are looking forward to this evening.
Mr. Hart. Of course!
Dinner with Mr. Hart and his dear lady wife, Mrs. Hart.
That's what I said. What's wrong with you?
Have you got a screw loose?
Oh, no, sir. Screws all tightened, sir.
Yes, I should hope so.
Employee dinners are a rite of passage
-for the new hires. -Ah.
Jones over there failed miserably.
Isn't that right, Jones?
The wife thought five courses would be sufficient.
And there was that paltry excuse for entertainment.
A string quartet?
And then you had that embarrassing display of beatnik enthusiasm.
I wore a turtleneck.
Yes. Best of luck out there in the unemployment line, Jones.
You know, I owe my success to being a keen judge of character.
No skeletons in your closet, eh, Vision?
I don't have a skeleton, sir.
Glad to hear it. Your future in this company depends on it.
AGNES: And you don't have a song?
Nothing special you played at your wedding?
No, nothing special.
I'll just loan you some records then.
So, we've got music covered, decor, wardrobe. Oh!
What about seduction techniques?
Oh, I have those.
Of course, you do.
Just out of curiosity, what does it say?
That you should stumble when you walk into a room so he can catch you.
It's romantic.
Any other tricks?
You could point out that the death rate of single men is twice that of married men.
Now, that's romantic.
Vision residence.
-Wanda, darling. -Vision, sweetheart.
Listen, about tonight...
Don't worry, dear. I have everything under control.
Oh, well, that is a relief.
I must confess, I'm really rather nervous.
"Nervous"? Whatever for?
Well, you know, darling, I still get a little tongue-tied.
Vis, after all this time...
There's an awful lot riding on this one, Wanda.
If tonight doesn't go just so, I think this could be the end.
Well, it's just one night. There's no need to get dramatic.
Look, I think the best course of action is to impress the wife.
And I think the best course of action is to impress the husband.
VISION: Well, wonderful!
Glad to know we're both on the same page.
Until tonight, then, my, darling.
Until tonight.
Is your husband tired of you burning his toast?
Try our new and improved ToastMate 2000.
It's the go-to for clever housewives.
Say, this machine has some shine.
You said it.
Set the dial and get the taste back into your toast.
Top and bottom heating elements can handle anything
from meatloaf, to cherry pie, to open-faced cheese sandwiches.
The all new ToastMate 2000 by Stark Industries.
Forget the past. This is your future.
Here we are!
How very atmospheric!
What's going on here, Vision? You blow a fuse?
Pardon me while I just go and fetch the lady of the house.
Guess who?
Wanda!
What is the meaning of this?
Well, what is...
Yeah, what is the meaning of...
Oh, the meaning of it!
You want to know the meaning of it and the meaning of it
is that this is the traditional Sokovian greeting of hospitality.
-Guess who? -Is that my host behind me?
It certainly is.
-Lovely to make your acquaintance. -Yes!
See, I forgot to tell you my wife is from Europe.
Oh, how exotic!
We don't break bread with Bolsheviks.
Oh, hush, Arthur!
And that dress!
Yes! It's... It's so... Sokovian, is what it is! Yes!
Can I just see you in the kitchen for a moment, sweetheart?
Oh, yes!
-Who are those people? -What are you wearing?
-Why are they here? -What are you wearing?
Well, it's our anniversary!
Our anniversary of what?
Well, if you don't know, I'm not going to tell you!
That... That man through there is my boss, Mr. Hart!
And his dear lady wife, Mrs. Hart!
The heart on the calendar was an abbreviation!
You move at the speed of sound and I can make a pen float through the air.
Who needs to abbreviate?
Darling, listen, it's all romantic to do the candles, the music,
-that stunning outfit... -Well...
I don't wanna be unappreciative, but right now...
Your boss and his wife are expecting a home-cooked meal.
Exactly.
Any chance they'd settle
for a single chocolate-covered strawberry split three ways?
I might have a better idea.
So I said, "If we orient the forms horizontally rather than vertically,
"we can use twice the paper, we can bill twice the cost."
You truly are a pioneer!
But the larger purpose of the forms is...
Was to analyze our input and our output.
You're awfully dense, aren't you, Vision?
Oh, Agnes! You're a life-saver!
What kind of housewife would I be
if I didn't have a gourmet meal for four just lying about the place?
Not that Ralph ever wants to eat anything but baked beans
which explains a lot about his personal appeal, mind you.
Oh, my!
Do you think Wanda needs help in the kitchen?
We haven't any tidbits or tartlets out here,
nary a pig in a blanket.
-No, that's so kind of you, Mrs. Hart. -
But I'm sure she's absolutely fine in there!
Oh, thank you, Agnes. I think I've got it covered from here.
Oh, are you sure, dear?
Many hands make light work. And many mouths make good gossip.
Oh, shall I just pre-heat the oven then, dear?
-That won't be necessary. -Oh, All right, then.
Well, I know you're in a pinch so this menu can be done in a snap.
Lobster Thermidor with mini-minced meat turnovers to start.
Chicken Ã  la King with twice-cooked new potatoes for your second course,
and Steak Diane and mint jellies for your main.
Do you set your own jellies, dear?
-Yes. -Good girl.
Recipe cards are on the counter there.
You men stay put.
-I sense a domestic emergency, so... -Mrs. Hart, please don't. You can't.
You... Please...
Yeah, take out the papers and the trash
Or you won't get no spending cash
If you don't scrub the kitchen floor
You ain't gonna rock and roll no more
Yakety yak! Don't talk back
Well, why don't we have a nice sing-a-long, all together then, shall we?
Oh, no, too much!
Oh, no, not enough!
Old MacDonald had a farm
Ee-I-Ee-I-O
And on that farm he had a...
had a...
Pig.
Ee-I-Ee-I-O
-With a... -Oink, oink...
-Here and a... -Oink, oink...
-There -Here an oink, there an oink
Everywhere an oink, oink
Old MacDonald had a farm
Ee-I-Ee-I-O
Oh, what was I supposed to do next? Oh, what was the main course again?
It was... Steak...
No. Steak...
Steak... Diane!
Yes?
Oh, I think that must be my wife summoning me.
She calls you "Diane?"
Yes, it's her pet name for me.
I'm just coming, Fred.
Excuse me a moment.
Oh, no.
How can I be of assistance?
Well, the chicken is no longer a chicken and the lobsters just flew the coop
so the steak is the last man standing.
It says here I can cut down the prep time with a meat tenderizer.
Excellent plan. Where's the tenderizer?
-I'm looking at him. -Ah.
Hoo-hoo in there!
Hoo-hoo back to you!
Okay.
Finish the meat, find the lobsters. I'll be right back.
I hope you're hungry.
Starved, is more like it.
My head is starting to feel woozy.
Were either of you aware
that married men are killing single men at an alarming rate?
-What are you going on about? -
And what's going on in there?
Who could that be?
Coming!
Oh, you didn't answer the back door.
For your upside-down cake.
Oh! Hi, I...
Who was that?
-A salesman! -Telegram!
A man selling telegrams.
Wouldn't you know it. Good news is more expensive.
I couldn't find the lobsters and did you want the meat tender or pulverized?
Oh, dear.
Well. I think tonight's going swimmingly.
Anyone for Parcheesi?
-My head is spinning. -Oh, Mrs. Hart...
Did you hear that? My wife's head is spinning.
Generally speaking, I don't like her head to do that.
Time to improvise.
You know, I'm beginning to think you're not management material, Vision.
You know, I had high hopes for you.
But from what I've seen here tonight, you can barely keep it together.
I mean, look around. There's all this chaos going on in your household.
Now, when are we gonna eat?
Dinner is served.
Breakfast for dinner?
How very...
European.
Ooh! Let's have a toast!
To my lovely and talented wife.
To our esteemed guests.
Yes. Cin cin.
Cheers.
Well, please eat before it gets cold.
Oh, Mrs. Hart, allow me.
So, where did you two move from?
What brought you here?
How long have you been married? And why don't you have children yet?
I think what my wife means to say is that we moved from...
Yes, we moved from...
And we were married...
Yes, yes, we were married in...
Well? Moved from where? Married when?
Now, patience, Arthur.
They're setting up their story. Let them tell it.
We...
Yes, what exactly is your story?
Oh, just leave the poor kids alone.
No, really, I mean, I think it's a perfectly simple question.
Honestly.
Why did you come here?
Why?
Damn it, why? Why did you...
Oh, Arthur, stop it.
Stop it.
Stop it. Stop it.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Stop it. Stop it.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Vision, help him.
Let me help you up.
Give me your hand.
All right, steady on, sir.
Well, would you look at the time?
Yes. We'd better be going.
Well... Are you both all right?
We had such a lovely time.
This guest is leaving your home.
You made me proud tonight, son.
First thing Monday morning, you and me are gonna have a little chat.
We'll see about that promotion.
Yes, sir! Thank you, sir!
Thank you.
Oh...
What a charming door knocker.
Good night!
We are an unusual couple, ya know?
Oh, I don't think that was ever in question.
Well, what I mean is... We don't have an anniversary.
-Huh. -Or a song.
Or even wedding rings.
Well, we could remedy that.
Today could be our anniversary.
Of what? Surviving our first dinner party?
Precisely. And our song could be?
Yakety Yak, naturally.
-Naturally. -Hmm.
And the rings?
Well, couldn't you make some for us?
I do.
Do you?
Yes. I do.
And they lived happily ever after.
Previously on WandaVision...
We are an unusual couple, ya know?
My wife and her flying saucers.
My husband and his indestructible head.
Hello, dear. I'm Agnes, your neighbor to the right.
You're like a walking computer.
What? I most certainly am not.
Dinner with Mr. Hart and his dear lady wife, Mrs. Hart.
What brought you here?
-How long have you been married? Why did you come here?
Damn it, why?
Stop it. Stop it.
Vision, help him.
-What was that?
Wanda?
Yes, dear?
Are you using your powers to turn on the light?
-Yes, dear.
Allow me, sweetheart.
What do you see?
Only your lovely rose bushes.
That's all?
Are you using your night vision, Vision?
I assure you, my love, I see nothing amiss.
You have absolutely no reason to be frightened...
You were saying?
Actually, I did overhear a couple of lads at work
remarking on a few unsavory characters settling in the neighborhood.
Now, who knows what those ne'er-do-wells might be up to?
Robbing houses, vandalizing property.
Walking through walls, moving objects without touching them.
Wanda, darling, you can't be suggesting my colleagues were referring to us.
One of us should really determine the source of that sound.
Yes, one of us should.
Oh, this is getting ridiculous.
I'm going to take a look.
-Oh, God! Darling!
Well, I think we handled that well.
Yes, I must say I'm rather proud of myself.
And look how you seized on the opportunity to redecorate.
-This is better, isn't it? -Mmm.
Wanda, darling?
Yes, dear?
Get the light.
WandaVision!
WandaVision!
WandaVision Wa-WandaVision
WandaVision Wa-WandaVision
WandaVision Wa-WandaVision
WandaVision!
Ladies and gentlemen, for my final trick,
I bring you the Cabinet of Mysteries.
-Darling, that's your cue. You said, "Cabinet of Mysteries?"
I said, "The Cabinet of Mysteries."
Oh, that's my cue. Ooh!
Holy Toledo!
Darling, do all the other acts in the talent show
have such elaborate props?
Are you kidding?
Fred and Linda are building a moat
and a fully-functioning portcullis and no one even knows why.
Let's keep going.
Yes, yes. Where was I? Um...
Watch closely as I, Illusion, Master of Enigma,
make my captivating assistant, Glamour, disappear.
You really are very dashing.
Mmm, thank you, darling.
Fear not, Glamour.
For I, Illusion, vow to bring you back exactly as you are.
Abracadabra!
Ta-ta...
Yes, um, Wanda, you're not at all worried
that the audience might just see through this little charade?
Well, that's the whole point.
In a real magic act, everything is fake.
Darling, the talent show fundraiser is the most important event of the season
and it's our neighborly duty to participate.
Plus, it's our chance to appear as normal as possible while doing so.
Well, I don't think that should be a problem.
This is our home now.
I want us to fit in.
Oh, darling, we do. We shall.
And we're gonna knock their socks off,
especially with you wearing this.
Oh, that's actually the rest of your costume.
Well, I better get going
If I'm gonna make the planning committee meeting.
That's me off as well, actually.
There's a gathering of the neighborhood watch
at the public library.
And after last night's excitement,
I want to make sure this town's security is up to snuff.
That's a swell idea.
You tell those tree branches who's boss.
Would you look at us?
Wanda and Vision, Westview fitter-inners.
I'll see you at curtain call.
Look, it's the star o' the show.
Agnes.
I'm sorry. What did you say?
Oh, I brought my pet rabbit. For your magic act.
Yes, of course! Thank you, Agnes.
We will take good care of him.
Señor Scratchy just loves the stage.
He played baby Jesus in last year's Christmas pageant.
Oh, morning, Dennis.
Morning, Agnes.
Stick 'em up.
Don't shoot. I'm just a messenger.
-Shall we? -Oh, we shall.
So, are you ready to meet Queen Cul de Sac and her Merry Homemakers?
Agnes, Dottie can't be as bad as you say.
Hmm, well, you'll notice her roses bloom under penalty of death.
Wanda, can I give you a bit of friendly advice?
Is it about the way how I'm dressed?
Yes, but it's too late for that.
Dottie is the key to everything in this town.
Country club memberships, parties, school admissions...
Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
You get in with Dottie and it'll be smooth sailing from here on out.
Just mind your P's and Q's and you're gonna do just fine.
Or maybe I could just be myself? More or less?
Oh, Wanda, that's good.
Everybody, hurry up please.
Hiya, Dottie! Your roses are divine.
Well, thank you.
The Rotary Club is finishing the stage set-up as we speak.
They've given the gazebo a fresh coat of paint
and will be installing the final decorations all through the town square.
And if you recognize the antique footlights,
it's because they're from my store.
And the chairs?
I'm sorry, Dottie. I didn't ask about the chairs.
So you better not ask me if you can chair any committees in the future.
The devil's in the details, Bev.
That's not the only place he is.
As you all know, the talent show
is the sole fundraiser for Westview Elementary.
This might help.
In the eight years since I founded our little club,
this event has gotten bigger and better every season.
Say, those pants are peachy keen.
Do you really think so?
The other ladies are in skirts. I was worried.
We only have a few hours until show time,
so a little less cross chatter and a little more focus.
Okay.
Those little boys and girls are counting on us.
All of this is for the children.
"For the children."
"For the children."
So, I want you all to give yourselves a big hand...
...at the appropriate time, of course.
But first let's review event etiquette.
Dress code is upscale garden party...
The only reason I didn't clap is because I'm afraid to move.
I actually don't know what I'm doing here.
I'm starting to feel that way myself. I'm Wanda.
-I'm, uh... Geraldine. -Hi.
And I'm irritated.
Tickets for tonight are completely sold out.
Now, you can clap.
And stop.
Really, how is anybody doing this sober?
Let's say green.
I mean, the other side could be dirt.
Pardon me. Is this the neighborhood watch meeting?
Oh, hiya, Vision.
Didn't expect to see you here.
This is sort of a "members only" type deal.
Ah! Certainly. Right. Well...
I'll just stay here and be as quiet as a church mouse
till you open up the floor for new business.
Well, in truth, we were just getting to new business.
Oh, splendid! Could you tell me how often you rotate security patrols?
Do you interface directly with local law enforcement?
What are your protocols for threats such as burglary,
graffiti, and reckless driving?
-No, Vision. -I know these are indeed grave matters.
"New business" actually means another round of Danish.
Raspberry or cheese-filled?
Oh, neither for me, thank you. I don't eat food.
What I mean to say is that I don't eat food in between meals but at mealtimes.
I'm a regular eating machine.
Hey, fellas. Vision here has got a point.
Now, listen up. I got some top secret intelligence for you.
Oh, excellent.
Now, you know how Johnson's been braggin'
about that treehouse he built for his kids?
Yeah.
It's a prefab job.
That blockhead can't even swing a hammer.
I can do you one better.
You know those bowling trophies Arthur's always polishing?
He bought 'em all at a yard sale in Hackensack.
I knew it. I've never once seen him down at the lanes.
I too have some top secret gossip to share.
Norm here's a Communist.
Vision, you're a real cut-up.
You know, I always thought you were kind of a square.
-Me? No, I'm as round as they come.
Hey, care for a stick o' Big Red?
Well, hold on there a second.
Didn't you hear the man? He doesn't eat food.
Is gum food?
Well, my understanding is that it's purely for mastication.
No, I don't do that.
Well, when in Westview... Cheers.
Who knew you were such a funny guy?
And to think you came here all hot and bothered about protocols and nonsense.
We actually thought you were serious.
He's funny. All right, so, back to this barbeque.
That is why you never do a seating chart on an empty stomach.
Golly, you're a whiz at all this committee stuff, Dottie.
Thank you for choosing me to help you clean up today. I feel so lucky.
You are.
I can't help but wonder if you and I
haven't gotten off on the wrong foot, Dottie.
And I would like to correct that if I can.
And how would you do that?
I've heard things about you.
You and your husband.
Well, I don't know what you've been told,
but I assure you I don't mean anyone any harm.
I don't believe you.
Wanda. Wanda, can you read me, over?
-Wanda? -Who is that?
Wanda?
Who are you?
Wanda?
Wanda.
Who is doing this to you, Wanda?
Wanda? Wanda? Wan...
Dottie!
You... Oh!
Pop quiz, Wanda.
How does a housewife get a bloodstain out of white linen?
By doing it herself.
They say a man is never fully-dressed without two important accessories.
His special lady...
and his Strücker.
Strücker. He'll make time for you.
Glad I don't have to follow this guy.
Huh? What?
Oh, but you're gonna be great.
What time is it now?
Mmm, two minutes after the last time you asked.
I don't know where he could be.
-Oh, is that him?
Well, it looks like he's got a little hitch in his giddy-up.
Wanda, my little cabbage, you look smashing!
Vis.
Where have you been?
Uh, well, me and the boys were playing
a rather thrilling game of horses with shoes.
No, that's not it.
Shoe horses! No.
Ah! Horse's shoes.
Listen, something strange happened with Dottie.
Well, something strange happened before that, too. It's hard to explain.
I was just playing with his shoes.
What is going on?
You are!
I want to thank you all for coming out
to support Westview Elementary, "For the children."
"For the children."
And for our final act...
I give you, Wanda and Vision.
Hey! Hey! You're up, Cowboy!
What?
Oh! Yeah! I've to go!
Hello, Westview! Good afternoon.
It's so lovely to be...
I'm so sorry. Excuse me.
I am Glamour and this is my delightful assistant, Illusion.
I am Glamour and he's Illusion.
Yeah, what she said.
Today, we will lie to you and yet you will believe our little deceptions
because human beings are easily fooled
due to their limited understanding of the inner workings of the universe.
Flourish!
You just do it, you don't say it out loud, honey.
And now my wife and I will delight
in your dumbstruck little faces.
Flourish!
Ha! See there? He's using a rope.
Wanda, what's... Oh, no! Oh! No! Wanda, please!
-Darling, let me down! -Oh!
-I'm feeling pukey!
Uh, what's next?
Oh! Yeah, this is... This is gonna be great!
A staggering feat of strength.
-Ah? -Illusion... Uh... Uh...
-Illusion, Master of Enigma, allow me. -Yeah?
-What?
Whoops! You weren't supposed to see how we did that trick.
That was my grandmother's piano.
Oh, Sherbert! Yeah, this is my old mate, Sherbert.
Stand up, Sherbert. Say hello to the crowd.
It's Herbert, Herb.
Pipe down, Sherbie, and pick a card. Any card.
Yeah, put it back in the deck.
I'm not looking. All right. Watch this.
Is this your card?
Uh, no.
I beg to differ.
Really? Is this your card?
Vision...
Is this your card? Is this your card? Is this your card? Is this your card?
-Is this your card? -Mmm-mmm.
Argh! Is this your card? Is this your card?
-No. No. No. No. -Is this your card?
Is this your card? Is this your card? Is this your card? Is this your card?
Is this your card?
Oh, it is!
It is what?
It's my card.
Well, pardon me, Herb. Have it back.
Oh, no, you did the trick right.
Well, of course I did the trick right! I'm Illusion!
Flourish!
And now, for my next trick...
Oh, goodness me.
Who stole my hat?
Oh! Oh, stop that rabbit!
I gotta need to pull a hat out of it.
Señor Scratchy's got real star quality, don't you think?
Maybe we leave the poor bunny out this one, shall we?
Well then, I will just have to pull this hat...
...out of myself.
Vision, no.
I'm doin' it.
-If only you all knew our secret.
Is that how mirrors work?
Shut up, Bev.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, for our grand finale.
I bring you, The Magnet of Crysteries!
The Cabinet of Mysteries!
Yeah, yeah. What she said.
I will now make my wife...
...disappear.
Are you sure you don't want an audience volunteer named "My husband Ralph?"
No. Abracadabra!
-Uh, sweetheart? -Yeah?
-Hi. -Oh.
What's in the box?
What's in the box? What's in the box? What's in the box?
Yeah, what's in the box?
What's in the box? What's in the box?
What's in the box? What's in the box?
Flourish.
Let's get outta here.
Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
-I'm so stupid. -Vis? Vis, it's all right.
It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
But what is going on with you?
I have no idea. I've been feeling weirdy all day.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Would you look at that?
That really gummed up my works, didn't it?
I'm not as funny without it, am I?
Well, you're back to yourself and that's all I care about.
Now, let's get out of here before Dottie
and the planning committee string us up for ruining the show.
You two, stop right there.
Nothing like what you two just did up here
has ever happened in the history of our talent show.
Dottie, we are so...
Hilarious.
That was the most hilarious act we've ever seen.
Wouldn't you all agree?
Yeah.
Oh, yes.
You two, come on up. Come on.
On behalf of the planning committee,
I would like to award you
with the inaugural Comedy Performance of the Year.
Oh, thank you.
-I have to ask. Hmm.
One second, I'm backstage and in the next, I'm in a dark cubby hole.
How'd you do it?
Oh, a magician never reveals his secrets.
He leaves that to his assistant.
And she's not talking.
-I had a feeling you'd say that.
"For the children!"
"For the children!"
You were tremendous, Glamour.
As were you, Illusion.
I don't know what I was so worried about.
It wasn't so hard to fit in after all.
And all we had to do was be ourselves.
Well, with a few modifications.
-And it was all for the children. -For the children.
Well, I think the children might need some popcorn.
Wanda.
Hmm, what?
Vision... Is this really happening?
Yes, my love.
It's really happening.
If it's that damn tree again, I am going to rip it out by the roots!
I don't see anything.
What is that?
Wanda.
No.
Vision... Is this really happening?
Yes, my love.
It's really happening.
Vision...
Wanda? Who's doing this to you, Wanda?
Wanda?
At a time in the world where things were feeling less and less certain,
there was one thing you could always count on
the Heroics.
Our planet's team of superheroes.
And our heroes
never failed.
Sorry I'm late.
I had to put the ISR synthetic aperture together.
Let's just hope it's more than just a downed satellite
so the whole team can spring into action.
Let's not.
Be careful with that thing.
When am I not careful?
All the time.
Hey, Tech-No.
What's up?
The solar array,
it's blown to bits.
Seriously?
There's something coming,
a spaceship of some kind.
It just blasted some kind of energy ray at me.
Do these clowns not know who I am?
I don't mean to be a nudge, but any idea how long this'll take?
I'm running on fumes.
Just a quick selfie for my socials while I stop this thing...
Wait a minute.
There's not one ship
There's a whole armada out there.
Funny, if I didn't know better, I'd say you sound a little worried.
Miracle Guy?
H-Base! Come in, this is Tech-No!
- Miracle Guy's been hit! - Hit with what?
He's barely conscious!
Miracle Guy is barely conscious?
Have a catcher ready!
I'm out!
This was the day
our heroes fell.
All of them.
But from that
others would rise.
It's funny how when you look back on a day like this,
it always begins so normal.
I mean, look at me.
I'm actually putting real thought into what I'm gonna wear.
Like any of this was gonna matter in an hour.
This one says, "Talk to me,"
and this one says,
"Leave me alone."
Perfect.
- Time for breakfast, Missy. - Good morning, Dad. Be right there.
In rather bizarre news,
both Miracle Guy and Tech-No
were spotted plummeting from the sky this morning.
Must have been some kind of test drill for the Heroics defenses,
for they deployed a giant safety net
and caught the celebrated...
Morning, kiddo.
You sleep okay?
Did you?
I see you're wearing "leave me alone."
You know, I want you to try to make some friends.
Yeah, not today.
Whoa.
Is that Miracle Guy?
That is just a training exercise, probably.
A a "what if."
As long as there's no "what if"
that involves you rejoining the team.
Relax. Even though I'm still the leader of the Heroics,
I'm doing it from the safety of my own office.
Good.
Because a deal is a deal.
-See you later, Dad. -Mm-hmm. Be good.
Hey
what's wrong?
Nothing.
I'm just, uh
I love you.
An "I love you" at 8:00 a.m. on a random Tuesday?
Are you sure you're okay?
I love you too.
Got the force field's up today, so something's going down.
Did they really see an armada out in space?
Next stop, Heroics lobby.
We're tracking over a hundred alien vessels.
Who do you wanna send?
How about
Blinding Fast and Crushing Low?
They haven't gotten along since the Crisis of Edinburgh.
Okay.
How about
Sharkboy and Lavagirl?
-They still married? -This isn't a two-hero job.
Look
Okay, so we'll send three. Happy?
I'm afraid those are just the scouts,
the tip of the spear.
This is what we're really up against.
We've never dealt with anything like this before.
That's impossible.
Which hero should we send, ma'am?
All of them.
Call the president. He's the only one that can authorize a full Heroic attack.
It's before noon.
He'll still be asleep.
Wake him up!
Excuse me, Marcus.
What are you still doing here?
When I said everyone, I meant everyone.
I can't suit up.
I promised my daughter.
Okay, well, I'm sorry.
They'll need all the help they can get, and you know it.
It's time for you to rejoin the team.
Time to be a Heroic again.
That is an order.
Yes, ma'am.
Good.
Just grab it!
I'm trying!
Can't you just fly up there or something?
I can't fly.
Use your magnet hands.
I don't have magnet hands.
Hurry! I'm getting tired!
How about hurricane breath?
Hurricane breath? That's not even a thing.
-Wait. -Whoa!
What's up? Did she get it?
She tried, but she doesn't have any powers.
But you're...
Marcus Moreno's kid.
I know. It's weird.
Not me. Gravity.
Thanks for the ball.
You're welcome.
Missy Moreno?
Yes.
You'll need to come with us.
What was described earlier today as merely telescopic observations
So where are we going again? And why?
above the Earth's atmosphere is now confirmed to be something more serious,
causing a mass mobilization of superhero personnel
What mobilization?
- What is believed to be an alien - Can you turn it up?
Wait, wait. Did they say, "Aliens"?
Dad? Dad, what's going on?
Missy, where are you? Are they moving you to headquarters?
I think so.
- Good.
Dad?
Not worried, not worried
So I'm Miss Granada, director of the Heroics program.
You'll be staying in our underground stronghold
where children of superheroes are kept safe
while their parents fight enemy forces.
We can't afford to have even one of you fall into enemy hands.
This way.
Do I really have to go in?
Because I won't fit in.
I just don't belong.
I mean, I'm different from all of them.
Besides, my dad doesn't fight anymore.
And after my mom died, he promised that...
Yes, well, you know what they say about promises?
You should always keep them or you're a liar who can never be trusted?
Are you going to be a problem, Missy?
Shall we?
Everyone
this is Missy.
She will be joining you today.
Missy, I'd appreciate it if you would take a seat right there
and quietly continue your studies along with the other children.
Children
thank you for respecting my rules.
Your parents will be very proud when I tell them
of your exceptional behavior.
Well done.
She's gone!
Yeah!
Hey, I'm Wheels.
Yes, they call me that on account of the wheelchair.
It's a little on the nose, but I like it because it's cool.
Okay.
You may think I'm in the chair 'cause my legs are weak,
but it's the opposite.
My muscles are so strong my bones can't support 'em.
But lucky for me, my brain's the same way.
It's supercharged,
so I'm good.
So, Wheels, who's your new friend?
Missy, this is Noodles.
We call him that because, well
He stretches and twists around like a noodle?
Yeah, basically.
And that's Ojo.
Her power is she's a genius drawer.
Like Van Gogh mixed with Monet with just a sprinkle of Salvador Dali.
Can I see that?
A kid standing on top of floating chairs?
An exploding exercise ball?
Nothing she draws makes sense.
That me?
-Why'd you draw me in front of the class? -Oh, she won't answer.
She only speaks through her drawings.
No, you don't. You have no clue.
And this is A Capella.
-It me. -That's your superpower? You can sing?
Yep, but I have an unusual range.
I can go low
or I can go high!
I can even go really
I don't hear anything.
It's beyond human hearing.
Miss A Capella Vox,
please refrain from using your high voice.
Every dog in the neighborhood has surrounded our building.
And she can sing so low that she moves objects.
Show her how you make things float!
All righty, let's see who's left.
That's Blinding Fast's kid, Slo-Mo.
He's actually moving very fast,
but somehow, his powers have him stuck in a time warp.
Hi.
That kid over there
Two packs of candy for crossing our eyes.
is Facemaker.
Okay.
Beat that.
He makes the craziest faces.
It's impossible!
I can even change my face to look like you.
He's cheating! I can't compete with that!
Oh, dude!
Rewind, clean up on aisle two.
That's Rewind. He can rewind time but just a few seconds.
They're twins. It's crazy, right?
What twins? What are you talking about?
Fast Forward, are you at it again?
You were taking so long, I skipped you forward a bit. Sorry, not sorry.
She and Rewind are twins.
Opposite powers.
The only thing they agree on is they don't like each other.
-At all. -At all.
They're twins. It's crazy, right?
And then, there's our fearless leader, Wild Card.
There's not a power in the world he doesn't have.
True.
Sure, he has every power imaginable,
but since he can't focus his energy, they show up randomly.
Also true
until now that is.
Teleport!
And last, but definitely not least,
Guppy.
How are you making that?
My mommy is Lavagirl, but my daddy is Sharkboy.
So instead of lava, I move water.
I need hydration for my powers to work.
- That's really cool. - Thanks.
So, new girl, what's your superpower?
Yeah, uh, so with the whole powers thing...
Wait a second.
I remember you.
You're Marcus Moreno's kid.
Yeah, my dad hasn't gone on any missions for a while,
so I've been chilling with the normal kids.
Why would they put a kid with superpowers in with normal kids?
Oh, I get it.
You don't have any powers.
You're powerless?
Whatever. Can we put on the TV?
I want to see if there's news about our parents.
You know this is an epic Heroic smackdown event
when they've called in Sharkboy!
Yeah!
Earlier today, Sharkboy appeared from the ocean depths,
landing on the beach of South Padre Island.
And moments later, Lavagirl
blasted up from inside an active volcano.
Go Sharkboy and Lavagirl!
She's from the Earth's core.
And here's Mayor Doolittle
at today's ribbon cutting for his new city hall,
rebuilt after the last time the Heroics went into action.
Did you see that?
Of course you didn't.
That means it's none other than Blinding Fast,
the fastest Heroic on the planet.
Go, Dad!
And here comes Crushing Low!
And there goes the mayor's new building in record time.
These battles are insanely expensive for taxpayers,
but so entertaining.
Pass the popcorn. This battle's gonna be epic!
This is unprecedented.
All of the Heroics have been called into action against the alien threat.
We're getting some live footage now.
And look who's back in action.
It's Miracle Guy.
You didn't expect him to actually lose, did you?
He's not supposed to be there.
Oh my God!
No way! No one's ever taken down Miracle Guy!
Evasive maneuvers!
You okay, Sharkboy?
Oh no. I'm just getting some terrible news.
It's almost unimaginable, but two of our heroes
have been captured by the intruders.
I thought the Heroics were unbeatable.
They are unbeatable.
It's not over yet.
It looks like our heroes are fighting amongst themselves again.
-Ladies first. - I don't need your dated chivalry.
-Fine, I'll go. -How dare you!
-Mom! -Dad!
Go, Dad!
- How dare you!
I want to see it again.
And I don't want to see it again.
And here comes Mrs. Vox to the rescue.
She'll get those aliens singing a different tune.
They took Mrs. Vox!
They got Tech-No.
There goes Lavagirl!
What is happening? Our heroes are dropping like flies!
They won't get Blinding Fast.
Not him, he's too...
It's all up to Marcus Moreno now.
Dad?
Dad, we had a deal.
I know.
I promised I wouldn't be a hero anymore.
But I'm still the leader of the Heroics.
Dad? Dad, run! Get out of there!
And a good leader
leads by example.
Dad!
I'm sorry, honey.
This is unbelievable.
- Unimaginable. - Ladies and gentlemen
the Heroics have fallen.
We're getting word that the president would like to address the nation.
People of America,
as you have witnessed,
the Heroics have been captured.
Military forces are stepping in,
mobilizing to bring our heroes back.
But while it looks rather hopeless
it's bad, it...
It's hopelessly bad.
How did this guy get to be president?
He can't even put two sentences together.
We have just received a message
from the supreme commander of the aliens
that has been decoded.
It reads, "We are from the planet Ogima.
Unfortunately, we have no choice
but to prepare you for
takeover.
Please comply,
or else Earth will be destroyed.
You have three hours."
I'm afraid that was the entire message.
There are no heroes left.
God save us all.
Children, for your own safety,
we're going into full lockdown.
No one leave your seats.
As long as you stay where you are, you are all safe.
Yeah, right. They can't protect us from that. We just saw it.
You got a better idea?
We should probably do what Miss Granada says.
Uh, pardon me, but...
The last look on my dad's face will haunt me forever.
-What do they want from us? -Do you think our parents are okay?
-Uh, excuse me? -What?
We need to leave this room right now.
Why?
Because the aliens know where we are, and they're coming for us next.
How could you possibly know that?
Can I borrow this a minute?
Ojo drew these.
Facemaker standing on top of the floating chairs,
Noodles smashing the exercise ball
She draws what she sees, big deal.
She drew these things five minutes before they happened.
Ojo's superpower isn't that she can draw,
she can draw the future.
Okay, cool.
Good for Ojo. What's your point?
She also drew these alien creatures breaking into this very room.
There.
Whoa!
You're saying they'll come through there?
She's right. All these drawings suddenly make perfect sense.
Ojo can see the future.
Let me get this straight.
Some new girl shows up with absolutely zero powers,
and suddenly we're gonna do what she says?
Seems like she's got a point.
A moment ago, you agreed that we weren't safe here.
We're safer in here than running around outside with you playing captain.
I just want to get out of here.
If anybody wants to join me, you're free to follow.
Fine.
We're getting out of here,
but only because I say so, you got that?
What's the plan?
Granada said this place is on lockdown. There'll be guards everywhere.
Yeah, Missy.
What's the plan?
Well
I figure this is kind of like making an omelet.
You always start by
Breaking some eggs.
Hey, is that updog?
What's updog?
Not much. Just living my best life over here.
Not like I'm totally up to no good or anything.
So don't ask us how we know this,
but aliens are about to attack,
and we're no longer safe here.
This place is a fortress. Nothing's getting in.
And I'm afraid no one's getting out, either.
Those are the rules.
Oof! Then we're definitely getting out of here,
and so we're gonna need your access cards.
Like, now.
And you think we'll just hand these to you?
No, but it would have made this a whole lot easier.
Cushions.
What are these for?
Tell him, Guppy.
To protect your butts when you hit the ground.
Why don't you get back in line?
Oh, no!
She's got shark strength!
Have a nice nap.
Aliens really are about to attack,
so we'll have to leave your expert care
until you and Miss Granada know what we know.
This was a bad idea.
Wheels, next time this happens, don't let the guard reach the alarm.
Noodles, you'll take his jacket and cuff them.
What next time?
You kids aren't...
Told you your plan wouldn't work!
No!
Rewind, send us back.
So we will have to leave your expert care
until you and Miss Granada know what we know.
Ah!
C'mon, let's go!
Single file line! Like a fire drill.
-We'll be questioned less. -Let's go!
Beginner's luck.
Noodles, stretch and make yourself tall!
- Greetings, fellow grown-ups. - Hey.
Hold on one second. Hey!
I I'm so sorry!
Seal the doors!
We're in trouble.
That was our only exit!
-Not our only one! -How are we supposed to get up there?
A Capella? You made furniture float. Can you do the same with people?
To go up high,
I have to sing very
Climb as fast as you can!
Noodles, open up the hatch!
Don't let them follow us!
Noodles, the access cards!
We did it!
Yeah, we did it.
But the tram will only take us to just outside the force field,
then they'll catch us for sure.
Look! They're already mobilizing!
Brace yourselves!
You too, Guppy.
A Capella,
make us fly.
Yeah!
She can't steer!
-We'll crash into that building! -We need to change directions!
I'm on it!
Help him out!
Back to base.
Now.
We need to find that train.
Well,
that was a disaster.
That was awesome.
I'm so exhausted.
Whoa!
Guys
I'm running
out of
Breath!
We get it.
What do we do?
Don't look at me.
I'm done.
-We need to find a place to hide. -The Heroics are locked in the alien ship.
Not all of them.
You know this how?
Do you think you can get us over to here?
Whoa!
Okay! Okay! Okay!
What's over there that's so important?
Well, you see, my...
Okay, this is bad. This is really, really bad.
-Five to one says we die a fiery death. -You're on!
You can do it, A Capella!
Come on, a little more.
Does anyone have a lozenge?
Hang on!
My begonias!
Get out of my flower bed, you little termites!
Hi, Abuelita!
Ah! Ah, Missy!
- Come and say hello to your grandma! - No way!
Missy, your grandmother's Anita Moreno?
The trainer of the Heroics?
She's a legend.
No, you have to be dead to be a legend, honey.
Oh, mi amor.
I'm alive and well,
which is more than I can say for my gazebo, hmm?
Sorry.
We're in trouble, Grandma, and we need a place to hide.
To hide? You're gonna need to do a lot more than that.
That thing is moving into position.
She's right.
We only have two hours left.
Won't be long until the takeover begins.
Everybody, get inside. Come, come.
Come.
Come on, people,
how hard can it be to find a dozen untrained, unfocused children?
I've got something. It's weak.
It seems to be some type of communicator.
Belonging to this kid
patched into our system.
Can we trace it?
Hold on.
Got her.
Hmm.
But we're children.
Yes,
the children of the Heroics.
If anyone is gonna save the world, it's you,
because all of you have superpowers.
Super lame powers.
Speak for yourself.
Okay, Johnny Random.
Hmm
This is no way to be a super team.
Abuelita's right.
Aliens are about to invade,
and if we want to rescue our parents and save the planet,
we're gonna need to do it now.
Are you saying that
we can be superheroes?
Well, yeah.
I guess that kinda is what I'm saying.
Sorry, it was there for the taking.
I need you all
to maximize your powers.
Grandma, I've been trying to do that my whole life,
so if you have any ideas, I'm all ears.
Um, it's not about who is the strongest or fastest.
It's about working together,
and that's why we'll need someone to be the leader.
That would be me.
I was actually talking about Missy, but thank you.
Follow me!
Quickly. Quickly!
Fast. Fast!
But I'm the leader!
He's right. I'm totally okay with that.
Well, I'm not. And we don't have time to argue.
So, what I say goes.
- Yes, ma'am. - Hmm.
Welcome to my training ground.
Let's boogie.
Stand together.
Feel the rhythm.
CÃ¡lmate, Guppy!
Calm down, dear.
Whoa oh! I can't do this!
Nope, not for me.
Yah!
Ah. Okay, nieta, your turn.
What? I'm not ready.
And that's how you become ready, by doing it. Mwah!
Go!
I'm picking up a leap in the sound.
What are they saying?
- Can you hear them? - Yes, it sounds like
they're rocking out.
What?
Okay, work together.
Wrong way! You're going the wrong way!
Guppy, stay calm!
Guppy! You're in a shark frenzy!
Attacking even your friends.
Your powers are useless
if you don't stay calm and focused.
Go meditate.
Someone catch Slo-Mo!
- Noodles! I mean, no, Facemaker! - What?
Who? Make up your mind.
I got him!
Listen to me!
Slo-Mo, you never do anything right.
I don't understand your problem.
-My problem? -Yes. You wanna come up in my face.
What's your problem? Talk to me. What is it?
-You don't know what you're doing. -I don't know what I'm doing?
We do work in the same organization.
It'd be nice if you communicated.
Why don't you just vanish, Invisi-Girl?
Oh, I'll make you disappear.
Don't make me use my outside voice on you two.
If you'd fought the aliens like this, we wouldn't be captured.
That's what I've been saying.
Why don't you cheer us up by singing one of those little songs
you sing so well, Sharkboy.
Man, you got some fish to fry.
Hey, hey, hey. Calm down, Sharkboy.
He's just baiting you.
Please, stop fighting.
You're like children. Actually, worse.
Yeah, Miracle Guy, why not pretend there's a camera on you?
There's not a camera on me, and it's kind of liberating.
I can be my true self, and my true self doesn't like you,
or you,
or you.
What the heck is that?
It's a camera.
I demand you release us,
whoever or whatever you are.
-Mr. President. - Greetings, Heroics.
There's something you should know, Mr. President.
I didn't vote for you.
The aliens didn't allow much time for me to give you this message.
It's about your children.
They've disappeared from headquarters.
They'll be completely helpless without us.
That's good. Back in formation!
Keep training.
Now, now.
You didn't expect to get it on the first try, did you?
I'm never gonna get it.
Not with a million tries.
You know why?
Because I'm useless.
Who told you that?
Everyone told me.
In those exact words.
I have trained all of the greatest superheroes,
Miracle Guy, Sharkboy,
Tech-No, Lavagirl.
Do you know who the greatest superhero of them all was?
It was your mother.
But my mother was normal, like me.
Exactly.
And without your mother,
your father never would have become someone who leads by example.
And you will too.
I'm sure of it.
Mi amor, I'm sure of it.
Miss Moreno!
-What? -Better come quick!
Oh my
Oh no.
They sure found you fast.
They wanna take us back to headquarters.
Well, too bad.
- We've got a world to save. - Hmm.
Go through this tunnel. I'll hold them off.
Go, go, go, go. Go!
I wish you could come with us.
Hug me, as if it's for the last time.
Hey, it won't be.
I promise.
That's my girl.
Go, go, go, go. Go!
Guys? Come on!
It sure is dark in here.
Ojo, can I use your flashlight?
We just have to stick
together.
Yeah, and find a way up to the mother ship,
and defeat the aliens who defeated all the Heroics.
Oh my.
Visitors.
Want some lemonade?
No?
Fine.
What could we do differently from our parents?
Everything.
Like we lure the aliens out of the cities, so that we don't destroy more buildings.
She's right. Our parents always have huge brawls
in the middle of the most populated cities.
Don't we need superhero costumes?
All superheroes have costumes.
Pads, fake muscles, tons of useless buckles.
Underwear on the outside.
Masks you can barely see out of.
That's why they were able to pick out our parents so easily.
Because they were easy to spot.
We have to blend in.
Be
stealth.
How?
Just trust me.
I have a plan.
-Where? What plan? -I'll show you.
The plan is we're gonna sneak on a bus?
Oh.
Holy doo doo.
I mean, yes, very interesting.
Uh-huh.
Okay, makes sense. Yep.
Okay. Wow, that's really smart.
Okay, everyone, Missy and I figured out a way for us to do this.
Check it out.
Ojo drew us a clue.
A supply ship.
So what does that mean?
It means there's probably one nearby
that we'll sneak on board and pilot up to the mother ship.
That's actually a good idea no matter who thought of it.
Thank you.
Come on, it's time we show these aliens what's what.
Hurry up, Slo-Mo!
Look, there's the supply ship.
Just likeÂ Ojo's drawing!
Ew. Gross!
Shh. Keep it down!
Wait.
Wait a second.
Let's go.
Shut the door and let's get out of here.
-Wheels, can you... -No! We're not all here!
What? Who's missing?
Oh
Slo-Mo! Cut it out! Run!
Hurry! They're coming back!
-Ten to one says he's tentacled. -Dude!
Come on, Slo-Mo!
All right, hold me down!
Slo-Mo!
Yes!
Wheels, tell me you figured this out!
It's incredibly intuitive.
Whoa!
-Please just choose any button! -It might be one of these.
But now what?
Don't worry.
Any minute now,Â Ojo's gonna draw a picture of all of us smiling
and hugging our parents.
Isn't that right, Ojo?
Oh, that's just great.
Hey
why did you choose me to share the idea of looking at Ojo's iPad?
I don't know.
I guess I know how hard it feels when everyone expects so much from you,
and you feel like you can't deliver.
Do you believe I can?
We all believe you can.
Tell that to my parents.
I will,
right after we rescue them.
I'm gonna go check it out.
We're all good.
Am I just really small, or is this ship really big?
-It's enormous. -Yeah. How are we gonna find our parents?
I was thinking about that.
Mrs. Granada found us really easily back at Grandma's house,
and I think I know how,
your bracelet.
I haven't been able to contact my dad.
But maybe the transmitter in here that connects the two bracelets
works like a tracking device.
But I need a pair of pliers and a heat source.
My teeth are strong because my dad's a shark.
-Perfect. -And I've got a heat source.
Heat vision!
Now he's a toaster.
Close enough.
Is it working?
Well, it's leading us somewhere.
Hey! That was really good back there.
Turning into a toaster instead of making heat vision?
It was heat-related. That's real progress.
I guess it's progress.
You just watch.
Pretty soon, you'll be teleporting like it's nobody's business.
It's about belief.
Um, guys
Does anybody else hear that?
What is that?
It's below us.
I can feel it.
Uh!
Which way?
That way!
Look at that thing.
What the heck is the president doing here?
So they're inside this thing? All of them?
- That's correct. - How long before the takeover begins?
According to the supreme commander, less than an hour.
So soon?
That's what she says, and she's never wrong.
You don't have to remind me.
Ever wonder why we bother with all this
when she already knows how it's gonna turn out?
All part of the process, I suppose.
What is that thing?
You heard him. It's a rocket stuffed to the gills with aliens.
In less than an hour, they'll send it down to EarthÂ and start the takeover.
Well, then we have to stop them. Let's go.
Do you children have any idea what you've done?
Stealing one of our trains?
Turning headquarters upside down?
Flying an alien shuttle into outer space. Hmm?
Well done!
Looks like we underestimated your abilities
and your leadership qualities.
You took a huge risk, but it was the right risk.
Headquarters was attacked just minutes after you escaped.
If you hadn't broken out, you would have all been captured.
And now you've managed to lead us into the heart of this alien mother ship?
Mm.
So proud!
Wait, so we're not in trouble?
Of course not.
You are heroes.
Yeah!
Yes!
Missy!
Her vital signs are all over the place.
Save your breath, Granada.
They know.
Uh-oh!
Hmm
Well, then round them up!
Watch it!
Quit the pantomime, Slo-Mo.
-You didn't even scrape a knee. -Mm-hmm.
Oh, good.
Just the kind of divisive attitude I've been counting on.
You kids are just like your parents.
The same in-fighting.
The same bickering.
Putting your own egos ahead of your team.
Take away her water.
They're too powerful together.
Oh, don't worry.
I won't take away your little toy.
I already know what your future is.
Imprisonment.
Life long.
Hmm.
How are we getting out of here?
I
don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
I mean
I don't know.
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.
Enough thinking.
I'm gonna punch my way out of here.
I have to save my son.
That's not gonna work.
How do you know?
While you were blinking your eyes, I went around and tried everything.
Uh, you were saying?
What are you? An alien spy?
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
I just want to see what it is.
Don't worry. It won't even know I touched it.
A-ha!
Anita Moreno?
Hmm!
Hi, Mom.
No, no, no, don't "Hi, Mom" me.
That was pathetic.
You stop training for a year and look what happens. Eh?
You dropped your guard.
And you attacked when you should have blocked.
And you rushed when you should've calculated. Eh?
I hope your kids paid more attention to me than you did.
Thanks, Mom.
I bet Miss Granada's been working there for years.
They must have hacked the elections and put their own alien in as president
so they could set a trap for the Heroics.
I'm such an idiot.
President Neil Anami.
Spell Neil Anami backwards and you have
"I'm an alien."
Everyone thinks that the aliens only invaded this morning,
but they've been here for years,
planning this takeover the whole time.
And now we're locked in this stupid cell
with no way out.
You're welcome.
Any luck?
I need water. Without water, I can't use my powers.
I need food. My stomach hurts.
-My arm hurts. -My ears hurt!
We never should have come. You led us here.
You think I wanted to get locked up in an alien ship?
It was all of us.
We did it together.
I wanna go home.
Me too!
We all want to go home.
The key is figuring out how to get out of this room
so we can make sure there's a home to go back to.
Wait a second.
What did you just say?
-He said we all want to go home. -Not that, the second part.
"Figure out how to get out of this room
so we can makeÂ sure there's a home to go back to"?
Stop saying that.
Keep it together.
Guys
maybe it's time to admit we're never getting out of here.
-What? -I mean, let's get real.
These walls and this door must be, like, two-feet thick.
It's totally impossible.
- Wow, great attitude. - Yep.
We're never getting out of here,
and we're certainly never seeing our parents again, that's for sure.
She's right. Pretty soon we'll forget what they even look like.
The way they smelled
It'll all just be
gone.
Jeez, you guys are really bumming me out.
But I guess
this really is the end.
But I'm not ready for the end.
I was just starting to think
maybe my sister didn't hate me.
I don't hate you.
I love you.
That love we feel
is real.
And
it's that love
that'll get us out of here.
Why are guys saying all this stuff? It's almost like you want everyone to cry
Oh!
Guppy, quick, gather all the tears.
What are you making?
I'm making a key.
Little Miss Guppy,
you just saved us.
Come on, let's go!
How long has it been this bad?
-You should've come to me. -You?
-Yup. -Hmm!
Don't you remember what your generation was like when we took over?
-Good point. -Mm-hmm.
Well, I guess it's up to the kids.
The next generation is always more
powerful, more
Evolved?
I got it!
What? You figure a way out of here?
Oh no. I figured out how to switch on these security monitors.
Surprisingly intuitive.
What?
At least now we can watch something
instead of sitting around yelling at each other.
Wait, what's this?
A Capella?
-Rewind? -Fast Forward?
Are those our children?
Wheels, how much time do we have?
Eighteen minutes.
Then we need to hurry if we want to stop the takeover.
Us? Are you nuts?
We have to go free our parents and let them handle it.
No! There's no time for that! By the time we get there, they...
No! I'm through listening to you.
When I woke up, everything was perfect,
then you come along and everything's a mess.
If Little Miss No-Powers is who you want as a leader,
fine, follow her straight into Alienville.
But Facemaker and I are gonna go get our parents.
-We are? -Yes. Right now.
Guys, we have to stick together.
Guys!
What can you do?
- Some people are just... - Forget him.
We need to get to the rocket so I can stop it before it launches.
How are you so sure you can do that?
Because everything the aliens build is super intuitive to use,
almost like it was designed for children to operate.
Get me close. I'll turn it off.
I don't understand. Why did we split up?
Where are we going?
-How do you know our parents are this way? -Okay, this is good.
-What do you mean, "This is good"? -Are you questioning my authority?
Uh I don't even know what we're talking about.
Really? The confused thing? That's what you're going with?
Just as I suspected.
Falling apart at the seams.
Hmm
We need to get that one.
He has so little control over his powers, he's liable to blow us all up by accident.
Let's go.
That's it there!
Uh no, we're not.
Uh guys?
What do we do now?
Missy?
Why are you so calm?
Because we have something they don't know about, a secret weapon.
-We do? -Yeah.
Teamwork!
Alone, our powers are special, but together we're unstoppable!
Slo-Mo, attack!
A Capella, eardrums!
Rewind, take them down!
Guppy? Guppy?
Guppy? Guppy, what are you doing?
-Staying calm. -Well, not now!
Guppy, listen to me.
Shark frenzy.
Everyone stand back!
Whoa!
Noodles, chin-up bar!
Go.
He's a miracle.
Great job, Wheels!
Go, A Capella!
Focus on super strength!
Focus on teleportation.
Hmm Nice try, kid.
Take him to interrogation.
Rewind!
I can't.
-We can do this. -How?
We work together.
I'll help you.
Noodles, get those shackles out of the ceiling!
Now fast forward, quick!
Again!
Looking for these?
Great job, Fast Forward. Excellent work, Rewind.
Excellent work, Rewind.
I just like hearing her say it.
Excellent work, Rewind.
Excellent work, Rewind.
Did you see their teamwork?
Just like their parents.
Okay, Wild Card, spill it.
What's the big plan, hmm?
Well, the plan was to get me close enough to you
to turn you into the dumbest alien that ever existed.
No way! My powers finally worked.
Keep laughing and I'll blast you right back to Ogima.
We have ways of getting the truth out of you, you know.
That'd be a first.
We only have six minutes left!
Not a problem. Not a problem.
All I have to do is reprogram the rocket's main contr...
What is that?
Maybe it's a
A force field?
No, no, no, we were so close!
But there's no one here but us.
Who did this?
I did.
Ojo, did you just talk?
I could always talk.
I simply chose to observe and listen instead.
And what I heard was chaos,
dysfunction,
disharmony
just like your parents.
But that's not true.
We were working together.
Were you?
Then where's Wild Card?
That's a good question.
Hey, Wild Card, old buddy.
Are you in the ship's control room yet?
I sure am.
Just like we planned, old buddy.
Ignore him.
That's some kind of trick.
I have Wild Card right here.
Don't I?
Boo!
Wow. I gave this plan 50-to-1 odds at best,
but you fell for it hook, line, and sinker.
We got the one with the useless superpower?
Got you far away from the control center, didn't it?
Go to the control center, now! Go, go. Go! Go!
You were working together?
Surprise!
I even sent him on a secret mission.
Isn't that right, Wild Card?
Yep!
And when the team leader tells you to do something, you hop to it.
Since when did you accept Missy as the leader?
Since the tunnel
when she told me you were an alien spy.
Ojo's an alien spy?
Yep. Ojo's a spy.
You knew.
How'd you figure it out?
You accidentally gave it away in one of your own drawings.
Your art never lies.
- She's an alien spy. - Holy doo doo.
You work for Granada, don't you?
Or does Granada work for you?
They all work for me.
What the
Ojo's an alien!
We know!
And now you can be impressed
and defeated
as soon as I figure out which button removes the shield.
Knowing the aliens, it's probably a big button with a picture of a shield on it.
I hate to spoil your celebration
but there's two minutes left.
Game's not over yet.
We'll hold it off.
You find a way to stop the launch.
It's not an it. It's a them!
Then you better hurry!
Come on, everyone.
Time to show these guys what we're made of.
Come on in. It's broken.
I mean it's open.
Wild Card, you have to keep those shields down.
Don't worry, Missy.
I'm on it.
Oh yeah?
What are you gonna do, hmm?
Turn into a bowling ball?
Sure
if that's what I want.
I can control my powers now.
Working with Missy helped me realize
I was so busy trying to prove everyone else wrong
when I should have been concentrating on proving myself right.
She believed in me.
Now I believe in myself.
Oh, right.
And you think that's enough.
Believing in yourself.
You tell me.
Let's do this.
Hmm.
Let's take him.
Everyone spread out!
Slo-Mo, attack!
Guppy, waterslide!
Hey, only speed up Slo-Mo.
How?
I'll help you.
Together.
Did you see that? Did anyone see that?
It was too fast
for even me to see.
Wow! Whoo.
Attack!
Flight.
Shape-shift!
Electricity fingers.
And my personal fave
The freeze ray.
- I'm running out of water!
This is too much stress. I can't take it.
Come on, Missy. You got this. I know you do.
Guppy, make ninja stars.
Noodles, slingshot!
Hold my leg!
Somebody pull Noodles!
I'm out. I need water.
Hey, Guppy.
This whole thing is covered in liquid metal. Liquid!
Go, Guppy, go!
Go! Yes!
Not so fast.
Noodles, make a tightrope.
Somebody go on to the center and draw them in.
No, wait!
I have to do this.
I can do this.
She's leading by example.
Hey! Did you see that?
Did you see what my son just did?
Unfortunately, I was too busy looking at my own cool kid.
- How's it going, Wheels? - Great.
All we have to do is swap out the ignition chamber's motherboard
with one that'll tell the device it launched even when it didn't.
-That way we fooled it... -Tell us how long.
Oh, now long.
Now put it into the ignition chamber up there.
Oh no.
Noodles!
I can't reach!
It's too high to jump.
Nobody would ever survive that fall.
I can.
Slo-Mo?
Slo-Mo!
Rewind, stop him. Reverse it!
Hold on.
I think he knows what he's doing.
We're running out of seconds.
He did it.
Did you see that?
He did it.
Uh, guys, how are we gonna get him back up here?
Wild Card?
We need you. Right now!
On my way.
Stay cool.
Dude! You actually teleported!
Get down there, quick!
-Yes! -Yeah!
Now swap the motherboards up there!
What's happening?
The takeover is happening.
Wait. So our parents were in the pyramid all along?
But I don't understand.
What's the takeover?
The takeover of power
from your parents.
You see, the next generation is always an improvement from the last.
Things are not heading in the right direction on your planet.
And you children are inheriting Earth's problems,
and need to be able to fix them,
sooner rather than later.
It's in the best interest of the entire galaxy that life
on Earth survives and thrives.
So, we infiltrated both your government
and Heroics headquarters
so we could train you and accelerate the transfer of power.
As you've seen from today's events,
it's not enough to be strong,
powerful,
or even magic.
If you do not use your strengths together
and with good judgment
you are doomed.
But I don't understand.
The clock hit zero.
We were one second too late.
The supreme commander knew down to the second
exactly when the takeover would happen.
Your guess was close, Wheels,
but not quite right.
Everything on the ship wasn't designed for children.
Oh, it was designed by children.
That's correct.
On our planet,
the children are in charge.
So, you're their leader?
Yes.
Just as I knew you would be a natural leader.
It's why I drew you at the front of the class.
So, from one leader to another,
as we each head off to face the challenges of the universe,
can we count on you to not just help save your planet
but the entire galaxy?
You have our word.
When you need us
we'll be there.
Thank you.
I love you. Oh!
How do you feel, son?
Strong
you know, like, really strong.
You're stronger than I'll ever be.
Proud of you.
Put it there, buddy.
What the
You're so fast.
I love you.
I love you, too, buddy.
I love you too.
You're so wonderful together. I am so proud of you.
You two make such a great team.
You two make such a great team.
Oh yeah! Come on.
-Hey, Dad! Hey, Grandma! -Hey.
Hey!
- Someone's made a few friends. - I tell you, Marcus, natural-born leader.
I should get captured more often.
Nope. Not without me, you're not.
If you ever go on any other missions,
I'm gonna be there right by your side.
Deal?
A deal is
a deal.
I missed you.
This was the day our heroes fell,
but others did rise.
As for the aliens, they'll be back,
and when they call on us for help, we will be prepared.
We will be ready.
So what are we supposed to be looking at?
Once upon a time, there was a young man
who believed there was nothing more important than a wish.
Not just any wish, of course.
The one that drives your heart.
The one that makes you who you are.
But he also understood just how impossible it can be
to make that wish come true.
How easily dreams can be destroyed.
And so, he set out to do something about it.
He studied the magic of the world tirelessly
and became a mighty sorcerer,
able to protect from harm or ill will,
any wish given to him,
and for the good and the worthy,
even grant that wish.
The sorcerer didn't know if the world would want his gift.
But he and his loyal wife found the most perfect island
deep in the Mediterranean Sea.
And there they built a kingdom like no other,
where anyone, any family,
no matter where they came from, were welcome.
Can this boat go any faster?
And to their joy, people came,
settled there from far and wide,
gave their wish and appreciation
for his protection,
and with the very real hope it could one day be granted.
And everyone agrees
there is no one more deserving...
...than my grandfather.
A most loving...
...and handsome...
...man who turns 100 years old today.
Oh, that's it?
Now you're done talking?
Valentino's never done talking.
If only we could understand you.
The King has called a wish ceremony today!
This is it!
No, it can't be a coincidence
the King is calling a wish ceremony
on your birthday.
Putt, putt, putt, and knock on wood.
Tonight's your night, Saba.
I can feel it.
Asha, let's bake a cake.
Oh!
- No. - But I love cake.
I mean, I... I can't.
- I'm giving a tour and then... - Hmm.
Um, I'm helping. I'm helping Dahlia.
- Yeah. So, eh... - Hmm.
- Why'd you say it like that? - Like what?
What are you up to?
What makes you think that I'm up to something?
Because I know your pauses.
I'm maturing.
My pauses are changing.
Asha!
Can't talk now, I'm gonna be late.
I'll see you at the wish ceremony.
Oh, I wouldn't miss it.
I've got a good feeling about it!
I'm here!
I'm here. I'm here.
Whew! Just one second.
Let me catch my breath.
Hola, shalom, salam.
Everyone ready?
Welcome to Rosas Come on, come this way.
Where the greatest creations are all on display.
There's no other place just as full of surprise.
Where your dreams and your reality can collide.
You wanna dance on beat?
Or to have hair touch down to your feet?
Go to outer space.
Well, hey, you've come to the right place
'Cause here.
In the city of Rosas.
You can turn all your wanting to wishing.
No what ifs and no wonders.
Oh, here, in the city of Rosas.
It's unlikely that you'll be unhappy.
With so much to discover.
A home for me, for you.
And all of us.
The city of Rosas
So, like, we have this king named Magnifico.
And he built Rosas many years ago.
With lightning for hands
And eyes that can glow.
No, no, no, I'm totally kidding.
But he is powerful.
He's just like us
With a twist.
And someone that I'd like to kiss.
Oh, dear!
A magic swish.
And there you have it, poof! There's your wish.
Ooh, and hey, did I mention when you turn 18.
You get to give your wish in a ceremony.
And he keeps them safe, every wish he acquires.
He grants someone's greatest desire.
It could be you someday.
Or my Saba Sabino's Oh, I can't wait.
Does it hurt?
Do you cry?
Oh, no and you won't even miss it.
When you say "goodbye"
'Cause here.
In the city of Rosas
You can turn all your wanting to wishing.
No what ifs and no wonders.
Oh, here, in the city of Rosas.
It's unlikely that you'll be unhappy.
With so much to discover.
A home for me, for you.
And all of us.
The city of Rosas
I'll give my wish.
Do you really forget your wish once you give it?
You forget without regret.
- I want to meet the King. - You're in luck.
There's a wish ceremony tonight.
You're welcome to stay and watch.
- I love food! - Enjoy.
This is amazing!
- I want to live here. - So do I.
- I'm never leaving. - This is delicious!
- Help me! - Huh?
Best friend and honorary doctor of all things rational,
my interview is in one hour,
and I'm so nervous I think I'm going to explode.
Interview. What interview?
Dahlia?
You mean the interview with our velvety sweet
buttercream of a king.
Oh, please don't say it like that.
My best friend, the King's apprentice.
I'll be famous.
I have forgotten how to talk. I have no words.
Is my mouth drooping? I feel like it's drooping.
Quick, ask me an interview question.
Okay, Asha, what's your weakness?
Weakness? Um...
I get irrational when I'm nervous.
No, no.
You care too much.
I do? Wait. Is that a weakness?
That's why it's perfect.
You're welcome.
Just relax.
You're surrounded by friends.
Cookies?
- Cookies. - I like cookies.
- Me first. - Look out.
- Out of my way! - Yes, yes, yes.
Cookies.
Give me the cookies.
- Out of the way! - Slow down.
- Move over. Okay, okay. - I love cookies.
- Safi, they're lemon. - Oh, no.
Yes.
Life is so unfair.
Take mine.
Bazeema, where did you come from?
Hi.
Oh, take mine, too. I can't eat.
Oh, right. Your interview with the King.
Hey, look at me.
Don't worry.
We'll be here for you when you fail.
Gabo.
Oh, there are the cookies.
Oh, Safi sneezed on those.
Oh, thanks.
Anyway.
Not that I blame you for trying to cheat the system.
What? I'm not trying to cheat at anything.
Come on.
Everyone knows the racket.
The King's apprentices get their wishes granted,
and usually their family's wishes, too.
- Uh... - Not always.
- Maybe always. - Mm-hmm.
Wait, isn't your Saba turning 100 today
and still waiting?
- Ignore him. - Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah!
Not to mention the fact that you're also turning 18.
- Happy birthday. - In a few months...
not today.
And when you give your wish to the King,
you don't wanna have to end up like Simon here, do you?
Huh? What's wrong with Simon here?
It's... I don't know.
You're kind of boring now.
No offense.
Have I become boring?
Do... Do you all think that?
- Achoo. - No, not boring.
- Just... - Calmer.
Oh, Simon, don't worry. You're still you,
and I bet you'll get your wish granted really soon.
Unlike your poor old Saba who's still waiting...
The Queen.
- Your Majesty. - Queen Amaya.
Oh, my goodness.
Asha, the King is ready for you.
Now? Am I late? I thought I...
You're fine.
The last interview...
It was a disaster!
...finished early. Shall we?
Oh, okay, I'm ready.
I am so not ready.
You're fine.
Just don't touch anything.
Don't forget to curtsy,
- and tell him I love him. - What?
I'm kidding. Do not tell him that.
Great. Thank you. Thank you so much.
Bye. Don't get your hopes up.
The apprentice
should always keep the fire going
because the King likes his tea hot.
- Uh-huh. - He also likes to talk.
Quite a bit.
- Feel free to just listen. - Oh, I'm a good listener.
Some items might seem strange,
but why a sorcerer needs what a sorcerer needs
- is not your concern. - Right.
And above all,
do not expect to see the wishes.
- Don't even ask. - Yes, ma'am.
I mean, I won't, Your Majesty.
I'm rooting for you, Asha.
- You are? - Mm-hmm.
Oh, thank you, ma'am.
But... why?
Well, I see the way you look out for others.
It's clear how much you love this kingdom
and its people.
Well, of course.
That kind of generosity has always been
the true essence of Rosas.
Now, are you ready to meet the King?
Oh, I hope so.
He'll be right with you.
I'm going to check on the ceremony.
Oh, okay. Um...
"Fire Magic,".
"History of Spells."
Whoa!
- Huh. Oh! - No, no. No, no.
Asha, that book is forbidden.
Oh. Hi. I was just, um...
What's happening?
Well, I put a spell on the... on the glass.
Well, I just thought the etchings were pretty.
Yes, but the book...
- the book is dangerous. - Ow! Then why have it?
A king must be prepared for everything. Hold on.
Hold still, hold still.
Oop! Don't move, I got it.
No, no.
- A bit of exercise. - Shoo, shoo. Shoo, shoo, shoo.
- Um, are you okay? - Shoo, shoo.
No. I...
I mean, yes.
And I understand if you want me to leave
and never show my face again.
Oh, please, let's not overreact.
You're here. You've certainly got my attention.
So, go ahead.
Tell me why you think you should be my apprentice.
Okay, well...
I care too much.
Okay, that's interesting.
It's my weakness.
Figured I might as well get through
all the bad stuff right up front.
Fair enough.
And your strengths?
Glad you asked.
I'm a quick learner and a hard worker,
and I help well.
And I'm young, so I'm malleable,
but not too young
- so that I'm too malleable. - Ah.
Oh, and I like to draw.
Is this anything?
Uh... What am I looking at?
- It's a goat. - Oh!
- It's hopping. - Certainly.
- See? - Oh, again.
- It's hopping. - That is a unique talent.
Do we call that a talent?
Oh, well, it's just something my father taught me.
I think I remember your father.
- Really? - He was a philosopher,
wasn't he?
Always talking about the stars.
We used to climb that tree on the high ridge,
where it becomes just you and the stars.
You know, he'd say,
"The stars are there to guide us,"
"to inspire us,"
"to remind us to believe in possibility."
Well, even when he was sick,
he'd take me out at night to dream.
All I dreamed about was him getting better.
How old were you when he passed?
Twelve.
That's not fair, is it?
When I was young, I too suffered great loss.
I... I didn't know that.
I'm sorry.
My entire family.
Our lands were destroyed by selfish, greedy thieves.
Hmm, if only I'd known magic then.
You see, I founded this kingdom
so there would be a place where everyone is safe.
Asha, no one should ever have to see
their dreams destroyed before their eyes.
No one should have to live their life
feeling the pain of that loss every day.
And that's why I do what I do.
And that's why I want to work for you.
Mm-hmm. Come with me.
You're one of the very few I have ever invited in here.
But if I'm to trust you,
I need to know you understand
just how important they are.
"They"?
The wishes of Rosas.
You can feel them, already, can't you?
They are everything.
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that.
No, no, that's it.
They are everything.
I didn't expect them to be so... alive.
Yes.
You see,
people think wishes are just ideas.
But no, no, they are a part of your heart.
The very best part.
If happiness was a tangible thing.
It would be you.
If you'da told me the feeling you'd bring
I'd think it untrue.
And people search for a wonder like you.
All of their lives.
You still amaze me after all this time.
You pull me in like some kind of wind.
Mesmerized by the hold I'm in.
Leave you here, I don't wanna I wanna.
Promise as one does.
I, I will protect you at all costs.
Keep you safe here in my arms.
I, I will protect you.
At all costs.
At all costs.
What's pain when I look at you.
No way I could explain you.
Even if I tried to
I'll never dream like I used to do.
If someone tried to hurt you
I don't see how that could happen
I'd fight for you in ways you can't imagine.
Felt this, no, I haven't
I hope it would be all right.
To stay right here beside you.
And promise as one does.
I, I will protect you.
At all costs.
Keep you safe here in my arms.
I, I will protect you.
At all costs.
At all costs.
If you're ever feeling like you're lost
I'll come find you.
Man all fronts.
There's no ocean I won't swim across.
To be right by you.
And not just once.
Here and now I swear on my response
I'll remind you.
And promise as one does.
I, I will protect you.
At all costs.
Keep you safe here in my arms.
I, I will protect you.
At all costs.
At all costs
You know, Asha,
I would love to see someone wish to be the best apprentice
a mighty sorcerer has ever had.
What do you say?
Asha?
It's my Saba Sabino's wish.
It's his birthday today,
and he's 100 years old.
That's impressive.
Your Majesty...
would you maybe consider
granting his wish tonight?
Well, that was fast, wasn't it?
You know, most people wait a few months,
even a year,
before they start asking me for things.
I'm so sorry.
- I did not mean to... - No, no, it's okay. It's okay.
Here, let me see the wish.
It is a beautiful wish.
Beautiful.
But, unfortunately,
it's too dangerous.
Dangerous?
Your Saba longs to create something
to inspire the next generation.
Great wish but too vague.
Create what?
A rebellious mob, perhaps?
To inspire them to... to do what?
Uh, destroy Rosas, maybe?
My Saba would never do anything to hurt anyone.
- You think that. - I know that.
Well, you're young. You don't know anything, really.
Whereas it is my responsibility
to only grant the wishes I am sure are good for Rosas.
So, most of these wishes will never be granted?
Yet I still protect them like all the others.
Can't you just give them back instead?
Excuse me?
The wishes you're not going to grant,
you could just give them back.
Then, I don't know,
the people can try to pursue them themselves?
You know, if they're dangerous,
then they can be stopped, but if they're not...
You've completely missed the point.
People come here because they know
they can't make their own dreams come true.
The journey's too hard.
It is too unfair.
They give their wishes to me, willingly,
and I make it so they forget their worries.
You make it so they forget
the most beautiful part of themselves.
And they don't know what they're missing.
But you do.
And now I do.
It's not fair.
My Saba is good.
The people of Rosas are good.
They deserve more than...
I decide what everyone deserves!
Mi Rey?
Sorry to interrupt.
But it's time for the ceremony.
Is it, my love?
Hmm. Seat Asha with you on the main stage.
Oh, no. No, no. It's okay.
I insist.
Are you ready, Rosas?
Another beautiful night in my kingdom.
So good to see you. Good to be seen.
First things first.
We have two new citizens ready to give their wishes.
Helena, Esteban,
you're going to be very happy here,
I promise you.
Now make a wish
and hold it in your heart.
It's a real weight off, isn't it?
Forget without regret. Whoo!
Okay then,
who is ready to have their wish granted?
Grant my wish! Over here!
Now, I have been challenged today
to take a chance
and try something new.
Thank you, Asha.
And it is with clarity and an open heart full of love
that I grant today's wish to someone who has very patiently
- waited long enough. - It has to be Sabino.
Sania Osman.
Where is Sania? There she is.
- Come on up. - He said, "Sania"? It's me?
It's me. It's me!
Coming through, thank you. It's just so exciting!
Sania Osman...
...I mean it when I say
it truly is my great pleasure to grant your heart's desire
to sew the most beautiful dresses
in all the land!
My wish has come true.
- Poor Saba. - He's waited so long.
See, never, ever get your hopes up.
Asha.
Obviously, I will not be offering you
the position as my apprentice.
But... But don't worry,
I will still protect your Saba's wish
and your mother's, forever.
- Mi Rey? - Now that went well,
don't you think?
Are you hungry?
Come now, we don't waste food.
Dig in and enjoy.
You're right, Saba.
We should be looking at the bright side.
Asha,
you got to the final few being considered
for the most prestigious position in the kingdom.
And Saba, there's always next time.
Cheers to that.
Asha?
Saba,
I need to tell you something.
Tell me what, child?
I don't think, um,
your wish...
- will ever be granted. - What?
Why would you say such a thing?
Because the King told me so.
He said it's too dangerous to grant.
My wish is dangerous?
No. That's the thing.
I don't think it is at all.
You... You saw it?
I did.
And you should know what it is.
No. No.
Don't say anything.
But it's so, so beautiful.
Well, clearly Magnifico feels otherwise, so...
Saba, what gives him the right to decide?
He... He is the King
and he has made everything possible for us.
If you had seen them, if you had felt them
like I did, you would understand.
It's not just yours, Saba.
There are so many wondrous, powerful wishes
that will never be granted,
- just floating there... - Asha? Asha!
- ...helpless. - Sit down, calm down.
I can't! I can't just sit here with you,
Saba, knowing your incredible wish
- and not tell you. - Then don't.
What?
You are excused from the table.
Saba?
Why? Why would you want me to know a wish
that can never be?
But I didn't...
But it's your wish.
Are you trying to break my heart, child?
No. No.
I... I would never, ever try...
I'm sorry.
Asha!
Asha!
Isn't truth supposed to set you free?
Well, why do I feel so weighed down by it?
If I could show them everything I've seen.
Open their eyes to all the lies.
Then would they change their minds like I did?
But when I speak, they tell me, "Sit down".
But how can I when I've already started running?
Oh, this is where we've been, but it's not where we belong.
And I may be young but I know I'm not wrong.
So, I look up at the stars to guide me.
And throw caution to every warning sign.
If knowing what it could be is what drives me.
Then let me be the first to stand in line.
So, I make this wish.
To have something more for us than this.
So, I make this wish.
To have something more for us than this
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, ah hah.
More than this.
I never knew I needed room to grow.
Yeah, I did what I was told when someone told me, "No".
Now I've got all of this freedom in my bones.
But I've still got the lid on so it doesn't overflow
'Cause I've got reservations and hesitations.
On where I should even begin
I'm past dipping my toes in.
But I'm not, no, I'm not past diving in.
If I could just be pointed in any given direction.
On where to go and what to do.
My legs are shaking but my head's held high.
The way you always taught me to
So, I look up at the stars to guide me.
And throw caution to every warning sign
I'm sure there will be challenges that find me.
But I can take them on one at a time.
So, I make this wish.
To have something more for us than this.
So, I make this wish.
To have something more for us than this.
- Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah - CHORUS: So, I make this wish.
- Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, ah hah. - To have something more.
More than this.
So, I make this wish.
To have something more for us than this
- Oh! Can you feel that? - Hmm.
What's happening?
No. No, no, no.
Mi Rey,
oh, you spoil us with your magic.
Whatever that was, it was marvelous.
I didn't do it.
What?
And it affected my wishes.
Is it some sort of warning?
I believe I have just been threatened.
Who would dare threaten you?
What was that?
You felt it, too, didn't you?
It... It was electric.
It was joy and hope
and possibility and wonder...
...inside the most loving light.
Can light be loving?
Ugh, I sound ridiculous,
don't I?
I'll take that as a yes.
Valentino!
Stay back.
Creepy.
Wait.
No, no, no, no. Aah!
Um, okay.
Aah!
Huh? Wait, what are you doing?
That is private.
What are you?
You kind of look like...
a star.
Okay, you can't be.
I mean,
I know I wished on a...
But...
no.
Yes?
This is crazy.
- We love crazy! - Oh! I'm seeing things.
Whoa, what are you doing?
Valentino, don't eat that.
It didn't work.
When does the magic happen? Ah!
Oh, something's happened.
I'm talking! I am talking. Ha!
Who knew my voice would be this low?
- Mmm. - Delicious.
Magic is chewy.
Sparkly and spicy.
Okay, I have a few thousand questions, starting with,
"How did I manage to connect with a star"
"all the way across the sky?"
and ending with,
"How is any of this possible?"
Just relax.
To all your questions,
there is one very simple answer.
Which is...?
Well, think about it.
We're no different, you and me.
We are all...
Overwhelmed?
And completely entirely made of the very same,
very special thing,
which is...
Hope?
Let's just try this another way.
Have you ever wondered why.
You look up at the sky for answers?
Or why flowers in the wind.
Are effortless and eloquent dancers?
Or what forms the rings in the trees.
Turns a pine from a seed?
What's passed down generationally?
To you
And to me.
And why our eyes all look like microscopic galaxies?
Have you ever wondered why.
You look up at the sky for answers?
Well, you don't have to look too hard.
We're here for all your question marks.
If you're try'na figure out just who you are.
Don't look far.
In the sky and your front yard.
In your heart and in your scars.
If you really wanna know just who you are
You're a star!
Yes!
Boom! Did we just blow your mind?
- Uh-huh. - Well, I've known.
The entire time.
When it comes to the universe, we're all shareholders.
- Get that through your system. - Solar!
See, we were all just little nebulae.
In a nursery from supernovas.
Now we've grown into our history.
We're taking whys right out of mystery.
- Now we're taking in. - All the star exposure.
We eat the leaves and they eat the sun.
See, that's where all the balls of gas come from.
Hey, you still look like you're hanging on by a strand.
But if you just see the mushrooms.
Then you'll understand.
So, your dust is my dust?
- Fantastic! - Whoo!
Well, you don't have to look too hard.
It's all around and not too far.
If you're try'na figure out just who you are.
You're a star!
Do you know you're a work of art.
Even in the deepest dark.
If you really wanna know just who you are
I'm a star!
Here's a little fun allegory.
That gets me excitatory.
This might sink in in the morning.
We are our own origin story.
If I'm explaining this poorly.
Well, I'll let Star do it for me.
It's all quite revelatory.
We are our own origin story.
Well, you don't have to look too hard.
It's all around and not too far.
If you're try'na figure out just who you are.
You're a star.
No matter where you end or start.
We're all each other's counterparts.
If you really wanna know just who you are.
I'm a star!
- Whoo! - Ooh, I'm a star.
Watch out, world, here I are.
- Hey, hey! - You know who's looking sharp?
- Who? - Me! I'm a star!
You're a star.
Watch out world, here you are! Hey, hey!
You know who's looking sharp?
- Who? - You! You're a star!
That was nuts!
I've never felt so connected.
We should do this more often.
It's a shame we don't get along better.
Hey, thanks for not eating me, John.
Don't mention it, Bambi.
It's all good.
This is extraordinary.
And my father said that we were connected to the stars.
That's why I wished
and now you're here...
for me.
Well, what do I...
Wait, do you grant wishes?
Oh! Oh, no, I'm sorry.
Obviously not.
Forget I asked.
I'm just not sure how this works.
I wished for more for us, for my family,
and for...
Oh. No, no, no, no.
Not in, like, a selfish way.
I just want their wishes to have a chance.
But, um...
Look, see, King Magnifico has their wishes in the castle,
captured in these ball-like, bubbly things
that are very beautiful
but very locked up,
and he'll never give them back.
What... What are you doing?
Careful.
My mother was shaved for that yarn!
Yes, that's the castle.
we take them back ourselves?
But if we take them, isn't that stealing?
I mean, we can't...
Right,
they don't belong to him, do they?
Well, okay, but...
Whoa! Wait, wait!
Slow down. We need a plan!
Ha-ha! Meant to do that.
I'm coming!
Bye-bye!
What was it? What was it?
Who could have commanded it?
Why is there nothing?
Mi Rey, what has happened here?
I don't know who we're dealing with,
and these books are useless!
Just breathe.
Do not tell me to breathe.
Everything... Everything I do is to make sure
that never happens again.
And when you're threatened, you do not breathe.
You focus.
To summon such light would demand
a spell so powerful...
No, you yourself say,
"Forbidden magic is not the way."
A king must be prepared to do anything
to protect his kingdom.
First, you must protect yourself.
That's what I'm doing.
Not like this.
We know nothing of these pages.
You command great magic.
But with this book,
I fear it commanding you.
Please, put that book down.
If you want answers about the light,
I suggest you look to your people.
- They love you. - I know.
They would do anything for you.
Of course they would.
You are their handsomest, most beloved king.
You're right.
I am a handsome king.
Oh, my love, excellent advice.
Rosas is so lucky to have you.
As am I.
Everything is fine.
Can you stop squiggling, please?
You're drawing attention.
Hi. Hello.
You know, I'm just gonna...
What's in the bag?
Okay.
You can come out now.
Are those pajamas?
Thank you. I feel seen.
Okay, focus.
I need to talk to Dahlia.
There has to be a way to sneak into the King's study.
Without anyone seeing you.
Yes, yes. I'm way ahead of you.
Star may alarm the masses.
- Much like a talking goat. - What?
Which is why you're both staying here.
With the chickens?
Did you see what just came out of that one's...
I'll be right back. Stay quiet.
Come on.
Even you have to admit, Gabo,
that light last night felt amazing.
It was probably a curse.
- Cookies. - Cookies.
No! This batch is for the King!
A squirrel just said "Good morning" to me.
I have no response to that.
I didn't either. Right?
I mean, what do you say to a squirrel?
I really have to watch where I'm going.
You touch 'em, you wash 'em.
It was an accident.
How? How do you always do that?
Hey, how are you and your poor Saba this morning?
- Oh, uh, coping. - Hmm.
And curious.
How do the kitchens get food up to the King?
the formal servers bring his meals to the dining room.
So, what about when the King eats in his study?
- What? - Who brings it then?
Well, his study is off-limits.
Details are known to only a select few.
Including you?
No comment.
- Ladies, please. - Who is in there?
I don't hear anything.
Dahlia, if you know a secret way
into the King's study, you have to tell me.
Why? What is going on with you?
Whoa! Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing?
I... I gotta collect eggs.
No! I mean, let me. I'll do it for you.
Nah, that's okay, Asha.
But your allergies!
All that sneezing. That can't be good for you.
Are you trying to take the chickens away from me?
You know Safi loves those chickens.
- I do. - Are you okay, Asha?
Something's up with you.
- What are you hiding? - Oh! Nothing.
Life is to be lived!
And nobody.
- What is going on in there? - Why are you all sweaty?
You can tell us anything.
Move or we break the door down!
No, no, no, no.
Fine. Fine!
Last night, after everything happened,
I made a wish...
on a star.
What are you, five?
And the star answered.
That's it, ladies.
Your wings can't fly but your voices can!
Okay, ladies,
big finish!
These are my friends.
This is objectively impossible.
What? Why am I making you sad?
Simon's 18.
He's already given his wish to the King.
I can't remember what I lost.
Don't accept it.
No. Stay away. No, no, no, no!
Am I the only one who realizes this is gonna end very badly?
Not if everyone keeps quiet about Star.
Magic is forbidden by anyone other than Magnifico,
who is also the only one authorized.
to grant wishes.
Self-authorized.
Wait. Does Star grant wishes?
No, but I think it wants to help me pursue mine.
Like a fairy Godmother.
Life is not a fairytale.
What did you wish for?
No, you know what?
Don't tell us. I want no part of this.
That's the King's call to assemble.
Uh... Please, Magnifico can't know about Star.
And I promise, my wish won't harm or affect any of you.
Or Rosas.
That's a big promise, Asha.
But we trust you.
Don't we, Bazee... Where did she go?
How does she do that?
It's okay. We won't tell anyone, Asha.
Right.
About the chickens.
We got you.
Right, Gabo?
I don't squeal.
- What are you not telling me? - Okay. Okay.
Yesterday, I kind of challenged the King.
- What? - It's, uh, complicated.
And?
Dahlia, what would you do if you found out
the wishes of those you love with all your heart
will never be granted?
You mean your Saba's wish.
And, thanks to me, my mother's.
I'm here to get their wishes,
so I can give them back to them.
You're here to steal from the King?
It's not stealing.
The wishes don't belong to him.
And you can't just
ask Magnifico for them back?
I think I've ruined my chances
of asking Magnifico for anything.
This is how we get food to the King's study.
It's perfect.
- A new way to climb! - Okay, look out!
- We can't fit. Ugh! - Backing up.
Are you sure about this?
Magnifico could come back any time.
And that's why you're gonna stall him.
Please and thank you, best friend ever?
How am I supposed to stall a king?
You'll think of something.
You're a genius!
- Ooh. To the left. - Let's go up!
I have to reach the pulley-thing.
And we ride!
I'm sorry, that was right in your ear.
- I can't believe that light last night. - That light was amazing...
Like nothing I've ever seen.
Quiet, quiet, quiet!
I know you are all wondering about that little light
last night.
A light I did not command or condone!
- What? - It was magic,
though quite clumsy and amateurish.
It was also completely forbidden.
There is a traitor
amongst us...
...who defied the law.
They used magic to put you all at risk!
But don't worry,
they are no match for me.
And I assure you,
when caught...
...they will be punished severely.
Asha.
You are
awfully slow at this.
I think we're here.
Adventure awaits right outside this door!
Let's go.
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no. It's locked.
I'll ram it.
It hurts without horns.
What are you doing?
Star, please don't break anything.
Yes, but don't hold back.
- What's happening? - Just go all out.
Throw magic dust everywhere! It'll be fine.
Yes!
No!
Rosas needs you.
Any information would be most helpful.
And I know you will never, ever
let me down.
Thank you.
Your Majesty, wait!
Please!
Yes, go on.
Ahem. Okay.
Hi. Hi. Uh...
Hi, I'm Dahlia.
I make your Magnifico cookies.
Fantastic. What can I do for you, Dahlia?
Oh. Thank you for asking.
You said any information would be helpful.
- Uh-huh. - But pragmatically speaking,
what qualifies?
Evidentiary?
How about circumstantial?
First hand? Ooh, second hand?
Sure.
How about hunches?
Yes, any. Any information
about who or what caused the light would be helpful.
So, yes, hunch. Hunch away.
You said it was amateur magic,
but how come you don't know
- how they did it? - What?
Perhaps you could define "amateur"?
This is about what you know.
It is about your safety,
and most importantly, the safety of your wishes.
Um, do you mean our wishes aren't safe?
Of course they're safe!
Good as new.
Whew. Hope he didn't need those.
Right, the wishes.
That's actually a door,
and Magnifico waved his hand and it just...
Okay, how about this? Nothing?
Or this?
This? Or this?
- Yes! - You got it!
Teamwork!
Star, I'm glad you are having fun,
but you have to focus.
Please, find my Saba's and mother's wishes
as fast as you can!
How do we know our wishes are safe?
We never see them.
Why can't we see them? Why is that a rule?
And why can't we remember them?
One question at a time.
Since we're asking, what if we want to change our wish?
Good point, wishes can change.
Let's form a line, everyone will get a turn.
You know what'd comfort us?
- Another wish ceremony. - Yeah.
It would make us all feel so much better.
- Please, Your Majesty! - We could do it now!
No! Not now! Bad timing!
Wishes, wishes, wishes!
Silence!
Is that all you can think about?
A Wish Granting Ceremony?
Fine.
Whoever identifies the traitor,
your wish will be granted!
What?
But hear this!
Anyone who helps the traitor,
anyone who lets me down,
your wish will never be granted!
Wait! Your Majesty...
Enough!
How brazenly they question me!
They only question you
because you make them feel safe enough to do so.
I'll be with the wishes.
Disturb me with nothing but good news.
I can't help it if mirrors love my face.
It's genetics.
Yeah, I got these genes from outer space.
Peep the name, I'm magnificent I put the "I" in omnipotent
I'm passionate, I'm not petulant.
Someone praise me for my benevolence
Just look
I'd give the clothes off Benito's back.
If you really needed that
I'd be the first one to volunteer.
If your home were to crumble Or if you were in trouble
I let you live here for free.
And I don't even charge you rent
I clean up all your messes.
And I'm always there when you need to vent
I give and give and give and give
You'd think they'd all be content.
And all I really want is just a little respect.
And this is the thanks I get.
This is the thanks I get.
And this is the thanks I get.
And this is the thanks I get.
You're so brilliant.
Oh, that's the least you could say.
There's more, admit it.
You're cute and strong.
And bold and brave Thanks!
See this kingdom, I built it up.
And you still complain? Ungrateful much?
Mmm, are you sure that you're not the prob?
I'd love to see you try and do my job.
I granted 14 wishes last year.
Come on, that's a high percent.
And now you're questioning your king?
The disrespect I just underwent.
You know, I always got your back.
Yeah, really though, it's no sweat.
Since the day you were born and the day that we met.
- And this is the thanks I get. - Dah dah dah dah.
This is the thanks I get.
And this is the thanks I get.
And this is the thanks I get.
I didn't wanna do this I swore I'd never do this.
But I'm hypnotized by how these pages flip
'Cause I refuse to have my power stripped.
A potion, a spell, a summon, a curse?
Anything to make that light reverse.
To this book I don't want to be tethered.
But desperate times call for desperate measures
Where was I? Oh, yeah.
There's a traitor in this town.
And still I remain unbent
Come out now, explain yourself
I'm sure it's all just an accident.
Well, whoever finds them first.
Now, that's a wish well spent.
Honestly, keeping you safe should be worth every cent.
And this is the thanks I get.
This is the thanks I get.
And this is the thanks I get
This is the thanks I get.
This is the thanks I get
I have just the place for us to work.
I was not afraid, Sakina.
Because, like all goats,
I believe the greater the challenge
we are willing to face,
- the greater the life we live. - Uh...
Saba,
I know you said you didn't want to know
a wish that could never be.
But now,
you can make it be.
It's so simple,
so pure.
Asha, I know you think you're doing a good thing, but...
I should never have given Magnifico my wish.
This...
This belongs to me.
Saba...
Oh, Asha, I may never actually inspire anybody,
but now at least I have the chance to try.
I'm going back for your wish next, Mama.
That's right, Asha.
You've been turned in.
Where is it?
Where is the star?
There's nothing here for you!
How did you do it, huh?
What sorcery did you use?
I know no sorcery.
You ripped a star from the sky
and used it to steal from me.
The wishes don't belong to you.
You were never going to grant my Saba's wish.
And he deserves to have it back.
- They all deserve... - I told you,
I decide what they deserve.
Please, Your Majesty.
She made a mistake. She won't do it again.
Oh, I know she won't.
Does this feel familiar,
- Sakina? - My wish.
Yes, your wish that you gave to me for safekeeping,
because we all know what happens
to wishes out in this...
this real world.
They get crushed.
- Mama! - Sakina. No!
Ooh, what is this?
What a gift.
All this time, I've protected the wishes not knowing
the power they yield.
I feel as if I can do...
anything.
The star.
I must have it.
Let's go! Now!
- What is that? - Hey!
- Is this yarn? - Hurry, hurry.
From one domesticated animal to another,
help us!
Careful.
That's it, Sakina. Hold on!
We've run out of land.
There's a boat.
Hurry.
Go, return to your stables.
If anyone asks, play dumb.
I say we head for the islet.
It's closest.
We can hide there.
Oh, thank you.
Mama?
My heart knows this feeling.
This is grief.
Oh, I didn't mean for this to happen.
I know, baby.
I was foolish to think I could change anything.
I should never have wished.
It's true.
My wish has ruined everything for my family.
And now everyone in Rosas is at risk
because of me.
Oh, Asha, no.
Everyone is at risk
because of Magnifico.
Our dear Rosas.
Your father's heart would break
for what we now know.
I know what you're thinking
because I'm thinking it, too.
- I love you both very much. - What is going on?
- When you get to the islet... - Asha.
- ...stay hidden from view. - What are you doing?
I have to stop him.
- No! - It's too dangerous!
I started this.
I have to finish it...
...for everyone.
- Asha! - No!
I cannot swim!
Perfect.
- Shark! - What?
No, no. I... I have not seen a shark.
I'm just practicing.
To harness a star...
Ooh, a staff.
A staff of such power,
even the night will bow to my command.
Perfect.
One branch of mountain ash
bathed in Tollen's potion.
Molten iron for strength,
copper for a strike.
And most important,
the power cast
from the innocent hearts of three.
You dared to question me
and all that I do for you.
You don't deserve to be granted.
But, through me,
you may serve a greater purpose.
My love.
Such sadness.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Amaya, darling, come! Come!
You're just in time to meet my new toy!
Now, that is power.
Am I glowing?
I feel as if I am. Yes?
How could you?
You know the ways of forbidden magic are...
Unappreciated.
Much like I am by my own people.
By that girl.
She did this.
She pulled a star from the sky
to destroy everything I've built.
Asha?
No, she only wanted her family's wishes back.
Do you side with the traitor, Amaya?
No. No.
You know I would never side with a traitor of Rosas.
I have believed in you from the moment we met.
We built this kingdom together.
There is nothing more important than that.
Wonderful.
Now, let's go set the stage.
I'm on the hunt!
You know, all of this is just a bump in the road.
A gigantically, humongous bump.
We have to find Dahlia and the others.
All I see are feet.
Look at these poor people!
Asha stole and destroyed their wishes.
She must pay!
They say her family's gone missing.
I bet she killed them.
This whole thing feels wrong.
Your faces!
It's okay. You're okay.
It's just a play on light.
You know I love you, Rosas.
The Queen looks scared.
Okay, okay, enough play.
I think we're thinking the same thing
again.
W-W-Wait, discreetly!
You are all probably wondering why you are here.
Yes, there's a savage teenager running around with a star,
destroying wishes. But...
guess who bravely came forward
and identified her.
Give a big cheer for.
Simon O'Donohue!
Simon?
I know, I know!
Tell me, I was as surprised as you all.
Our sleepy little Simon here.
No need to be nervous, Simon.
Be proud! Show us your joy!
- Your Majesty? - Oh, my.
I know, a talking mouse,
but don't panic.
I'm very clean,
and I have an important message for you.
"You once said,"
'Generosity is the true essence of Rosas.'
"I can see your fear,"
"but Rosas needs your help now."
"Love, Asha."
The "love" part was my idea.
Okay. Bye.
So, my dear Simon,
are you ready
to see your wish?
To be the King's most valiant,
courageous, and loyal knight!
Just not a loyal friend.
It is my great pleasure
to grant you your heart's desire.
Long live the King!
Long live the King!
Oh, isn't that wonderful?
There are six more traitors, Your Majesty.
Dahlia, Gabo, Dario,
Safi, Hal
and Bazeema.
Find them, so they may pay for their betrayal.
Find Asha, so you may be rewarded.
But most importantly,
find me that star,
so I will have the power
to grant all of your wishes!
It's a dead end.
A dead end with un-sanded mahogany.
Oh! Good find, Valentino.
My butt found it.
So, this is where you go
when you sneak off, huh, Bazeema?
Thanks for keeping it all to yourself.
Introverts deserve sanctuary.
I'm happy for you.
We're safe here.
No, we're not safe anywhere.
We're fugitives, thanks to Asha.
She said she just wanted
her family to have their wishes back.
Oh, and you believed her?
It's the truth, Gabo.
- Hide! - We're all gonna die!
Oh! Hey, Asha.
Please say you didn't destroy...
...those people's wishes?
Of course I didn't.
It was Magnifico.
Likely story.
Wait, the King was acting awfully,
awfully...
Awful.
Simon looked like he was in pain.
Yeah, right before he snitched on us.
We're doomed!
Not if we fight.
You've been deceived.
Magnifico is not the man he claims to be.
He's more vicious than I could have ever comprehended.
When I made a wish and Star came down.
This is not what I expected or intended.
But now that it's happened, I don't regret it
'Cause now I've seen him show his true colors.
And shades of green.
Saying that your wishes aren't safe.
Because of me and.
That's a lie, lie, lie, lie.
And I, I know I can't do this on my own and.
If it's not us
If we don't fight, he knows he wins.
Knowing what I know now.
The lengths he'll go
I won't sit back, watch this play out.
That's my vow.
Knowing what I know now.
Get up, yah!
Know I'm not the only one.
- That's fed up. - Yah!
Wait 'till they hear our feet go.
- Dun dun dun dun. - Yah!
I don't think he's prepared for what's comin'.
A revolution, hit the ground runnin'.
If there's one thing he can't keep down.
It's us and the strength we've found.
Loud.
Knowing what we know now.
Knowing what we know now.
And who, who knows if we'll succeed.
But we won't stop and we won't retreat.
- Or turn 'round - ALL: 'Round.
Knowing what we know now.
Knowing what we know now
Hoo! Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo! Hoo!
Hoo! Hah!
Hoo! Hah!
Hoo! Hah!
Can he tell what we're becomin'?
Hear it in the way we're drummin'
I was sweet but now I'm something else.
Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah!
Ain't it nice of us to drop in.
To take what's ours, to take it back in.
- Thinks we're nothin' - But we're something else.
I've seen too many bad things
- He loves. - One thing more than himself.
- His crown. - Crown.
Knowing what I know now.
Knowing what I know now.
The good in him, I've watched it melt
I was fooled by the love I felt.
- So profound. - Ahhh.
- Knowing what I know. - I know
- I know. - We know now.
Knowing what we know now
Oh! Hi.
Your Majesty, this is Star.
You are extraordinary.
You need to know,
Magnifico has embraced a most corrupt magic.
He is intent on capturing Star.
He wants to take all of your energy for himself.
Then Star needs to leave, like, right now.
No, no. If anyone's leaving,
it's gonna be you.
Star won't go until those wishes are free.
Does that mean you have a plan?
Of course we have a plan.
Oh! Fantasyland in the sky, huh?
How about Neverland?
The perfect nanny for your horrible children?
Poppin' this one!
Oh! True love, how sweet.
So much for true love.
Mi Rey!
Asha and Star have been spotted in the forest.
Is that so?
How fortunate.
Shall we gather the citizens,
so they can see you capture her?
Oh, we've been gathering them a lot lately, don't you think?
- I, um... - Oh, I'm kidding!
Sound the trumpets, Amaya.
I'll bring back the girl and the star!
Okay. We must work quickly.
And quietly!
I'll lead Magnifico as far away as possible.
And as soon as he leaves the castle,
you go help the others free the wishes.
I know, okay?
I'm worried, too.
Wait. What are you doing?
Oh, a stick.
Okay.
What do I do with this?
Ha! It's magic.
Thank you.
You have to go. Go now.
Okay. I can do this.
What?
Come on, come on, come on, pl...
Okay.
Good luck, Asha!
Challenge accepted.
- Wow. - Hi.
Through the heart we understand the world.
- Oh, look, hot drinks. - Nah-uh-uh.
Star! You're here!
Oh, thank goodness!
This is it, everyone.
First we open the roof,
and then Star returns the wishes.
The Queen said we need to look for giant pulleys.
Maybe these pulleys?
Start climbing!
As my mother always said,
"If someone falls,
"leave them!"
No, buddy, we're not doing that.
You can come back 'cause I... I hate heights.
Oh, nice!
And away we go!
- Wow. - Oh, this is high.
Here. Obsidian oil
for protection from the pages.
This reads like a recipe book for the foul and the savage.
Look for anything on how to break his staff,
bind his magic, or at the very least,
break the hold it has on him.
I don't get you at all!
It won't move!
I'm trying my hardest.
Hey, Dario, buddy!
It's called a pulley for a reason!
This is no time for riddles!
Come on. It's as obvious as my baby beard.
You must pull together.
On my count.
One. Two.
Nine zillyboo.
Twenty alphabet.
Wait, what?
I... I can't count.
Now!
That's it. Give it all you've got!
No!
Oh, he's become practically untouchable.
No metal can break his staff.
No spell can bind his magic.
And no one can bring him back from this.
"Embrace forbidden magic just once,"
"and you commit to it for eternity."
I can't turn, I can't turn, I can't turn!
Whoa, I can't stop staring.
Work for me, stick.
Oh, dear.
- We need more weight! - Hmm.
Well, it's not falling if you jump.
All right, fine!
For Rosas!
Jump, everyone!
I'm gonna die!
I'm gonna live!
- Are those our wishes? - They must be.
Oh, the wishes are free.
The wishes. She's freeing them.
Our girl.
Come on.
Saba, you're 100 years old.
But my will is strong. Yeah-ha!
They did it!
No!
It doesn't matter. You're too late.
Asha,
Magnifico's never too late.
Simon?
Star!
You really think you can take me?
Thanks, John!
Any time, Asha!
Please don't hurt me.
It's not me you should be afraid of.
Boom!
Star! Hyah!
Surprise.
Good evening, Rosas!
Wow, the stars are out tonight.
Oh, except for you.
You're trapped now, aren't you?
But you see, what can I say?
I really, really don't like being betrayed.
It is you
who betrays your people!
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
I've had enough of you.
Your Majesty!
Your little trick didn't work, Amaya.
I still got what I wanted.
What's this?
The wishes aren't yours to free.
They are mine!
Now, bow down to your king!
Star, get away from there!
No!
Asha!
Well, hello, Asha.
So glad you could join us.
How's the whole
"taking your wish into your own hands"
working out for you?
Oh, wait.
I don't actually care.
Hello, there.
- Let's do this! - Star!
No!
Yes.
Mirrors, mirrors on the wall,
who is the handsomest?
Me!
No!
I win.
Wishes really do come true.
You don't deserve Star!
I told you, I decide!
Oh! No, you don't!
There will be no wishing on stars ever again!
In fact, there will be no more hope,
no more dreams,
and no escape.
Run!
No chance to rise up.
No one to tell any tales.
No one to challenge me ever again!
You... are...
nothing!
We... are...
stars.
So, I look out at the stars just like me
And I'm begging you to see this as a sign
You really need to learn to give up.
'Cause I know that if you choose.
We'll be greater
So, I make this wish
Silence!
So, I make this wish.
- So, I make this wish. - So, I make this wish
To have something more for us than this
We've had generations.
Wondering why and wondering when.
We're past dipping our toes in.
We know it's do or die, it's sink or swim.
We were all confusing your promises for protection.
But we know what we've got to do.
Hope unchanging with our wish held high.
The way you've always
No! No! No!
Stop!
So, I look out at the stars
And throw caution.
What we do in this moment is defining.
And we can take it on if we align.
So, I make this wish.
No!
To have something more for us than this.
Those are my wishes!
So, I make this wish.
To have something more.
For us than this
- We did it! - They're free!
- My wish. - It's beautiful.
I'm going to make it happen.
Oh, I can't wait to get started.
This feeling.
Come home.
There you are.
Oh, my beautiful wish.
Mama, you got your wish back.
- My baby! - Asha!
I'm so happy for you.
Oh, this guy.
What do you have to say for yourself?
Asha...
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I don't expect you to forgive me.
I was just so scared I'd have to live without...
well...
all of me.
And I wanted so badly to believe in him.
So did I.
We all did.
Never trust a handsome face.
That's why I hang out with you guys.
Aw, you get over here.
Hello?
Hello?
This is your King.
Oh, Amaya, thank goodness!
Do you see what they've done to me?
Hmm. Well, you do love mirrors.
That is not funny. Get me out of here at once.
No.
What?
After everything I've done for you, for Rosas,
this is the thanks I get?
This is the thanks you deserve.
Hang it on the wall...
in the dungeon.
Please, no! The dungeon smells really bad!
Long live the Queen!
Long live the Queen! Long live the Queen!
Long live the Queen! Long live the Queen!
We never needed Magnifico.
- Magnifico, Schmagnifico. - Excuse us.
This way, this way. She's just over here.
Queen Amaya, I found her!
Your Majesty.
I hear you long to fly.
Well, Peter here wants to build a flying machine.
- Hi! - You two should work together.
Let me know how I can help.
I'm just getting started.
This is more than I could have ever dreamed possible.
I dream of a utopian metropolis
where all mammals are equal,
- and wear clothes! - Oh!
Wait. Where'd you go?
Ooh. I know.
I'm sorry I broke it.
is that a magic wand?
Okay, thank you, but no thank you.
I am no good with magic.
I mean, I put a dress on a tree.
- I will take it for her. - Uh-uh.
It's for Asha.
But what am I supposed to do with it?
Be our fairy Godmother. I mean, what else?
No, I couldn't be that.
I could?
Thank you.
Okay.
Sorry!
Clara!
And you wonder
why I'm grumpy!
I'm sure she'll work on it
with Star, right?
Oh, no.
I know you too well now.
You're going soon, aren't you?
So you can be there for others to wish upon.
I will miss you.
Oh, my voice is really high when I cry.
Aw, Valentino.
Well, soon doesn't mean tonight.
Oh, thank goodness!
That was just too much for me.
I am only three weeks old, after all.
Oh, Star, how can we ever thank you?
That's easy.
Just keep wishing.
Take it from someone like me.
When your hopes are in despair.
If your desires have strings.
Free them, give them some air
'Cause any wish that's got your heart.
On the edge of breaking.
Is a wish worth making.
Yeah, everybody dreams.
To be something someday somewhere.
Even kings and queens.
Daydream to be free from their royal chairs.
Well, any dream that's got your heart.
Even when you're not sleeping.
Is a dream worth dreaming.
Yeah, we all start as wildlings.
Playin' in the sun.
Then we grow up with wild dreams.
Just waitin' for our day to come.
So if hope schemes against time.
Tell them, "Be nice, play fair".
Yeah, they may kick and cry, yeah.
But just show them they're better when paired
'Cause if they both can hold your heart.
There's no way you're not sowing.
A dream that will never stop growing.
Yeah, any wish that's got your heart.
On the edge of breaking.
Is a wish worth making
Hi, I'm Gabi Diamond,
I'm here to interview for the private chef position.
Hopefully, he can see me right away
because I only had enough money to Park for 12 minutes.
Then you need to hustle, honey, 'cause you can't use the front door.
You need to use the service entrance.
Where is that...
Please tell me this is the service entrance.
It's right down the hall next to the trash chute.
- Okay. - Uh...
And as long as you're going that way.
(Panting)
Is this it?
'Cause I'm down to 11 minutes.
You found it. Follow me. (Laughs)
(Gasping)
Wow, this place is amazing!
Look at the Golden Gate Bridge!
You're so close you can make eye contact with the people stuck in traffic.
You're almost home!
Oh, hi, we're just finishing up here.
So, shh!
Oh, okay, I'll just be over here.
I won't say another word.
- Now, Mr. Voltaggio... - Oh, my God!
Chef Michael Voltaggio?!
- I am such a huge fan. - Thanks.
You know he won "Top Chef", right?
Personally, I think he could win "America's Next Top Model Chef."
- I'd audition for that show. - And bring home a trophy!
What are you doing here?
Just, uh, interviewing for the chef job.
Oh!
Uh-oh.
Thanks for coming in, Michael.
You'll be hearing from us very soon.
Possibly on the way to your car.
Well, as you can see, the position's filled.
So, buh-bye.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, okay.
So I didn't win "Top Chef," and I don't have any awards.
Heck, I don't even have a boyfriend.
But you know what I do have?
Lots and lots of debt.
Which means I'll be available to cook for your boss 24/7.
- By the way, I'm Gabi. - Yes, you are.
And you are Elliot Park.
Mr. Kaminski's publicist, slash right-hand man, slash
how lucky is he to have you?
Congratulations, you can Google.
Is that a sub-zero?
(Gasping)
Oh, last time I saw this much stainless steel
I was getting a pap smear.
Hey, everybody, I'm home.
Josh, you look fantastic.
Who travels 10 hours and looks this good?
Ha-ha, you!
- How was your trip? - Ah, China was awesome.
Only problem is you open a business there,
an hour later you want to open up another one.
(Laughing)
(Exaggerated laughter)
- Elliot. - Okay.
Ah, wait until you see what I bought.
It's a ring for Caroline.
(Gasping)
Check it out.
- Oh, my God, it's gorgeous. - Isn't it? Elliot, who's this?
Uh, hopefully your new chef if I'm lucky.
We're hiring a real chef, one with credentials and awards...
And tattoos.
Well, where is he, 'cause I'm starving.
Uh, well, I can make you something.
You're not the chef! She's not the chef!
But I am here, and I know exactly what you want to eat.
Because I am a food mind reader.
It's one of my superpowers.
So is driving without insurance.
Grilled Cheese?!
This looks... fantastic.
- Mmm. - (Chair hissing)
It's so Ooey-Gooey.
You know what?
Forget the other guy, you're hired.
- (Squealing) - Elliot: What?!
What... for making Grilled Cheese?!
It doesn't count if the name of the food is the recipe.
I'm going with my gut on this one.
And my gut is loving it.
(Sighing)
But your gut hasn't met Michael Voltaggio.
At least have her make a trial dinner!
That's fine, I'm not afraid of a trial.
'Cause I'm innocent and my food will be proven delish.
So, what do you want me to make?
Well, I'm proposing to my girlfriend on Friday,
and everything's gotta be amazing.
Like her.
She's cultured and gorgeous and way out of my league.
Can you make a dinner that'll make her say yes?
Oh, I'm gonna do better than that.
I'm gonna make her say, "Yes! Yes! Yes!"
(Gasping)
Six bags of groceries.
You either got the job, or did you finally clean out your car?
No, I got it...
In an almost-y kind of way.
I just have to make a trial dinner and if that goes well, I get the job!
And if that goes well, I get promoted!
Wait, what?
If I bring Josh Kaminski and his rich friends in as clients
to Garber, Stukenbaker and Rizz... (Gasping)
They'll change the name to Garber, Stukenbaker, Rizz... and Rodriguez.
Well, he's going to propose to his high-society girlfriend during the meal
and my food has to make her wanna say yes.
I mean, Sofia, what if I screw this up?
Uh, stop that.
You've got to be confident, okay, like I am at work.
When I deal with the partners,
I don't second-guess myself.
I march right into a meeting.
I look 'em straight in the eye, and I say,
"here's your coffee."
And nobody has to tell me how they want it, no!
Gary wants cream, Shirley wants sugar and...
Bob wants to stare at my boobs.
Confidence, boom!
Yeah... yeah!
In the kitchen, I have it together.
And Mr. Kaminski knows that because look what he gave me.
Uh... a Black Amex?
(Sighing)
You know what they say, once you go black, you never go back.

Elliot, what is that?
The backup meal for tonight, compliments of our future chef
Michael Voltaggio.
You do not need a backup.
(Sniffing)
That smells really good.
No, you know what, it doesn't matter because...
Boom!
Bravo, you set a table.
And made Cornish Game Hen with Gorgonzola Caramelized Pears,
and Truffle Mashed Potatoes, and a big side dish of bite me.
Both: Oh, my God, you look so handsome!
I mean really, really handsome.
Like a God.
Oh, Elliot.
(Chuckling)
This is my lucky suit.
I have closed seven huge deals in this suit.
Hopefully, tonight will be number eight.
But just in case things aren't going my way,
I designed this rabbit foot app for my phone.
You just kind of rub it.
You don't need that app when you have
all these apps-etizers!
Ta-da!
This looks incredible.

She doesn't wear socks, she has awesome legs.
She has awesome everything.
Do you wanna know the most awesome thing about Caroline?
- What? - She loves me.
And why wouldn't she?
I was always focused on work... till I met her.
Now I hardly ever think about developing
Rich Media Solutions in Flash and Javascript anymore.
Yeah, I hardly ever think about that either.
(Phone ringing)
Ooh, that's her, ain't she pretty?
Hey, baby, are you close?
I can't really hear you, you're breaking up, hold on.
Hey, Sofia.
So far, it's going really great.
He likes the way it looks, the music I picked, my singing.
No matter what happens, you are a female warrior.
And it's kill or be killed and you have to come out on top.
Um, are you watching "Hunger Games" again?
You don't watch "Hunger Games," you study it.
Okay.
I don't think she's gonna be getting here when we expected.
Oh, well, that's all right.
I can keep this warm for an hour.
You'll have to keep it warm a little longer than that.
Caroline wants to take a break.
Um...
Something about moving too fast and not being in control.
It's kind of hard to remember her exact words
when your life is crumbling in front of you.

But that's not fair.

Well, it's kind of unprofessional.
But I hear the food here is really good.
To Mashed Potatoes.
And to my favorite kind of champagne... free.
You know what?
This meal kicked ass.
It really cheered me up.
Well, I knew it would.
When my mom died, I used to make special meals for my dad
all the time, and it always cheered him up.
Aw...
I bet you miss your mom.
That must be nice.
I see mine every single day.
Well, my mom was the best.
She taught me to cook, and we watched Julia Child together.
I love Julia Child.
- Really?! - Yeah.
I studied her in a business class.
I mean, think about it.
She took her passion and turned it into an industry.
You know who else was full of passion?
- Caroline. - Shh, Potatoes.
Mmm.
Yeah, Julia Child was my inspiration.
Whenever I'm in a predicament, I ask, "what would Julia do?"
That's why I dropped out of college.
- Really? - Um-hm.
I dropped out of college when I sold my first company for $3.6 million.
Wow, we're so alike!
We both dropped out of college, we're both entrepreneurs...
Except you're in fortune 500, and to me, 500 is a fortune.

It's the toilet.

I love my new ring so much.
And you.
Oh, don't forget.
Tonight I'm hosting that business dinner.
I cannot wait to introduce you as my fiancee.
Oh, sweetie. About that, um...
You're gonna be there, right?
Absolutely... in spirit.
Listen, honey, I'm going out with my friends
to show off my gorgeous new ring from my gorgeous new fiance.
You understand, right?
Fine.
Why do you have to be so pretty?
I love you so much.
I'm gonna miss you while I'm in the shower.
And I love you.
I was talking to my ring.
'Cause you I'm taking with me.
Oh yeah?
Good morning.
Oh, good morning, Josh...
Uh, Mr. Kaminski.
Boss Kaminski.
I'm sorry, I don't know what to call you.
Some people call me Kick-ass Kaminski.
Nobody calls you that.
They would if you didn't shoot it down all the time.
- Josh is fine. - Okay.
- Welcome to your first official day. - Oh, thanks. Glad to be here.
Here's your first official meal.
Oh, nice.
You made my initials out of bacon.
Yeah, you know, I was gonna spell your whole name,
but I didn't want to give you your first official heart attack.
Um, so we're good, right?
Good? Oh! Oh, yeah yeah yeah, we're great.
You know, what happened between us at the test dinner was just like a silly
drunken mistake that, you know, thanks to the alcohol I just hardly remember.
But what I'm trying to say is I really don't think of you in, like, a sexy
or, like, a hot way.
You know, I really just think of you in, like, a totally professional way.
I was talking about dinner.
Yeah, so was I.
I think of tonight's dinner in, like, a totally professional way.
Turned that right around.
Caroline.
Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.
Gluten-free muffin I just... bakey.
Beautiful breakfast tray for a room I am completely unfamiliar with.
Oh shoot.
Get it together, Gabi.
You got this.
I got this!
You got what?
I got, uh, this!
Your breakfast, Milady.
Okay, breakfast is served.
Thank God it's the most important meal of the day
because tonight's dinner is going to be a bitch!
Okay, I need button mushrooms,
sterauce, ginger, catfish, two ducks, and a wok.
Eh, I don't think you have time for a walk if you got to get all that stuff.
I just wish I'd had a tad more notice!
And been a tad more truthful on resume.
Stop worrying. You are a good cook.
You are going to nail this and be around here for a long long time.
- Caroline, what's wrong? - My ring's missing.
And that little cook girl stole it.
Oh, you're so fired.
Caroline, I'm sure Gabi didn't take your ring.
But, Juju, she was looking guilty in the bedroom saying, "I got this".
No, no, no, no.
That's because you caught me in the middle of my power pose.
It helps me with my confidence.
Not so much now.
Damn, I never thought I'd see the day when a white girl
gets fingered before the black housekeeper.
All right, look, there's got to be another explanation.
I totally trust my staff.
Oh, that's what I love about you, Juju.
You think everyone's so good and honest.
- I do. - I don't.
I agree with Caroline.
Gabi isn't a cook, she's a crook.
Okay, look.
Everyone... everyone relax.
I have the entire penthouse wired with security cameras.
We can just go to the manager's office and get the footage.
- We can? - Yes.
Oh, Juju. Let's go.
Oh my God.
Worst first day ever.
You know I didn't steal that ring, right, Yolanda?
Of course you didn't. You're innocent.
Huh?
And watching that security tape
is a huge invasion of privacy. We should stop them.
Elliot, why are you suddenly on my side?
'Cause it's not fair.
And why do you have a sweat mustache?
Why do you have a real mustache?
And why are you wearing
an oven mitt?
I didn't see that coming.
I couldn't help myself.
I saw it on the nightstand and I had to try it on.
Now it's stuck. And I'm going to get fired.
This is the best job I've ever had.
All right, don't worry. We'll help you get it off.
Wait wait wait. Hold up, Gabi. First, Elliot,
- you got to beg. - Oh, that's really not necessary.
Please!
I'll do anything you want!
Come on, he needs us.
Thank you, Gabi,
I've always liked you best.
Um...
Your finger's really swollen.
Oh, I got something that can shrink things in a jiffy.
Is it a picture of you naked?
I'm sorry. It's a reflex.
No, I was talking about hemorrhoid cream.
Now hold still while I put it on.
Hemorrhoid cream?!
You want that ring off?
Fine!
Ah! Ah!
On your finger, fool.
Juju, when we watch this footage
and you see that little cook girl stealing my ring,
you're not gonna get all violent, are you?
No.
Are you?
It doesn't even matter. She didn't take anything.
Well, how can you be so sure?
Did you do a backgroud check?
I can assure you, I checked her out...
Very thoroughly.
- We're back. - Oh, there you are.
- Look who it is! - Kick-ass Kaminski!
Ooh, good news you two. Look what I found.
My God!
I love you. I love you.
- Thank you. - Where did you find it?
In a bag of hot air.
The vacuum cleaner.
I checked it,
and bam, there it was.
Do you believe it?
Do you believe it?
Of course.
See, Caroline. I told you. My staff is...
I don't remember dropping it on the floor.
Well, I don't remember the exact moment that I realized
that you were the world's most beautiful woman...
But you are.
Good point.
Sweetie, isn't there something you should say to Gabi?
Yes.
Thank you for finding my ring, Gabi.
I'm Gabi.
I'm sorry I accused you of stealing,
but you were acting like you were hiding something in the bedroom.
Well, I wasn't...
Hiding anything.
Especially in your bedroom.
The important thing is you got your ring back.
Yeah, and that I didn't steal it.
I mean, I get why you think that I would.
I'm totally in debt and I could live off that ring
for like 5, 6, 20 years.
But, you know, I'm not stupid.
If I wanted to steal something, I would take
something you wouldn't notice, like one of the 10 laptops you guys just leave around!
- Josh? - Yo!
She's so nervous.
Listen to her babble.
She's definitely hiding something.
No no, I'm not hiding anything.
I just babble. I'm a natural-born babbler.
My parents should have named me Brooke.
She said Brooke.
I mean, you should have seen me when I was here
last week for the test dinner. I just couldn't stop...
That's right. You were here last week.
Call the manager back.
I want to see all the security footage from the minute she walked into this house.
That is so not necessary.
I want to find out what else she's put her dirty little hands on.
Hmm, you two are so fired.
That must be the manager with the rest of the footage.
Someone order a massage?
Yes, for Caroline, because she's having such a stressful day.
Juju, that is so thoughtful of you.
I like it hard, deep and no eye-contact.
I just bought myself 90 minutes to watch this footage
and edit out anything Caroline doesn't need to see.
Oh, you are Kick-ass Kaminski.
Hell yeah, I am.
Owwie! Toe cramp! Toe cramp!
Hey, are you busy?
Yeah, having a panic attack.
Come on in and shut the door.
Um, I was just calling to see if there was anything else I could do
before I throw myself off the balcony.
Well, you actually might not have to.
Look at the footage from the bedroom.
The camera just focuses on the dresser.
Oh, well, as long as it doesn't focus on the un-dresser.
Let's just fast forward from the top
- and see what we got. - Okay.
Okay, that's us eating on the terrace.
Roline wouldn't mind that.
There's us drinking and moving to the couch.
She might mind that.
There's my top flying into the champagne bucket.
She is so gonna mind that.
Juju!
Are you in here?
Hey, I thought you were getting a massage.
No, I couldn't relax.
The Masseur was wearing brown shoes and a black belt.
What are you doing here?
I...
I thought I'd keep an eye on her while I was going over the footage.
Yeah.
So smart, Juju.
Let's play the tape.
You know what? I already did.
And I watched it from the top, and no one stole anything.
Except you with my heart.
Aww, so sweet.
- I want to see for myself. - Caroline, no!
Excuse me?
Let me ask you a question:
Do you love me?
- More than anythin... - Good!
And I love you too, but if we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together,
you better start learning how to trust me.
I watched the tape and no one stole anything.
- But... - But nothing!
End of discussion. Forget the damn tape!
Juju.
I've never seen you like this.
You're so mean and demanding.
I love it.
You do?
Yes.
Good, 'cause there's more.
Tell me, big boy.
You're coming to dinner tonight!
You're gonna meet those Chinese investors
- and you are gonna love it! - Damn right I am.
God, I want you so bad right now.
S-so is it like... is it cool if I go?
- Hey. - Hi, went to Chinatown
and got the rest of the stuff you need.
I also bought some illegal fireworks.
Yeah yeah, uh-huh.
That's what we need around here, more fireworks!
Man, I got to hustle.
I'm in so over my head with this dinner and everything!
- What are you doing? - Oh, to make it crispy
you have to pump air between the skin and the meat.
Are you freaking kidding me?
No no, I saw it on "Iron Chef".
Oh, and a "Looney Tunes Cartoon".
No I'm talking about this sweet view!
Will you take a photo of me out here?
Are you listening to me?
Today has been the worst day ever.
Elliot gave me this impossible dinner to make.
Caroline thinks I'm a thief.
And I know I shouldn't have a crush on my boss
and I pretty much don't, but then he defended me
to his fiancee, and... oh!
And then they started doing it on the desk.
Damn it!
Okay, don't cry.
It's just a duck.
Look how high we are.
We can just reach out the window and grab another one.
Uh, Sofia, it's not just the duck.
Five-second rule.
Okay, I get that you're freaking out.
Do you really? Because today is just the first day, okay?
What happens on the second or the third, you know?!
Tonight he's having guys here from China.
And do you know how many countries there are?
And how many lies there are on my resume?
Sofia, I can't do this job.
That's not true.
What you can't do is manage your money, get your car to work, pick a decent boyfriend.
Wait! This is the opposite of cheering me up!
Okay, not done yet!
What you can do and what you do better than anyone else I know is cook your ass off.
My duck was on the floor.
Good evening, everyone. For dinner tonight
we have a whole catfish prepared in the style of the Fujian Province.
I hope you find it Fujian amazing.
"Fujian amazing," that's good.
I don't get it, but I'm having a really good time.
Okay, next, we have a dish I like to call "Falling Duck"...
With a spicy Szechuan Pickled Cabbage.
Okay, tough crowd.
And lastly, I figured you might be kind of sick of Chinese food,
or as you call it, "food."
So I made my famous Spaghetti and Meatballs.
Thank God! I am sick of Chinese food.
Seriously?
Well, if you like this, then you're gonna love dessert.
Please say apple pie.
Apple pie!
Apple pie!
They like it.
Oh good, I caught you.
The spaghetti and meatballs, that was stroke of genius.
Yeah, well, I almost had a stroke making it.
It completely changed the mood in there.
I mean, they're finally talking about something other than work.
It turns out Mr. Lee's a scorpio.
And how cute was it when he and Mr. Wang
ate my spaghetti "lady and the tramp" style?
Adorable.
So we're good?
Well, now, yeah.
I mean, it was a pretty close call with the ring and Caroline and that tape.
And to be honest I wasn't sure if you were gonna be able to pull off this dinner,
but you did, like a rock star.
I'm proud of you.
Um, I meant am I good to go home?
- Absolutely. - Cool.
- See you tomorrow, Chef. - See you tomorrow, boss.
I got this!
Oh, the button.
You're all here,
because I found something on the security footage that we should all see.
Marriage?
Well, I hadn't thought about it, but yes yes yes!
I love you! I love you! I love you!
We love you too, bud.
I was talking to the ring.
